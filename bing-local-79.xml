        <body>We started at the bar 30 mins before our reservation time. Very friendly &amp; enjoyable. The staff were very personable, came and got us for our reservation time. It&apos;s winter so the outdoor areas were closed off with heaters which all worked well. Had the she crab soup and it was outstanding.  Had the filet and it was perfect in every way. We will eat her again. Made the reservation on Open Table. That all worked perfectly.</body>

        <body>Very disappointed.  This restaurant was recommended by a friend and was not inexpensive.  First off, you go inside but are immediately taken back outside (into the cold) and upstairs to a back room.  Service was slow because of this and wait staff were all dressed in coats.  We were seated by the bus table with supply boxes visible in plain sight.  A special &quot;three olive&quot; salad was recommended by our server and came WITHOUT olives!  When this was mentioned, olives were brought out in a separate dish...no effort was made to replace or re-do the salad.  Salad was not taken off of the bill, either.  My wife&apos;s crab cake was simple and unappealing...presentation was poor.  My dish (a seafood ravioli concoction) was adequate but far from &quot;unique&quot;.    Altogether disappointing experience for a restaurant with it&apos;s price tag and &quot;reputation&quot;.  With so many other options in Charleston, we will not be returning.</body>

        <body>I wanted to love 82 Queen after it had been recommended to us as a nice historic spot. I went with my Mom and our meals were good but nothing was great about our overall meal. Maybe is was because we were there for lunch, but this won&apos;t make my short list when family comes to visit me as a must go restaurant.</body>

        <body>Very beautiful spot and the server was very nice. Had the prime rib. It was thin and dry and overlooked. With all the great restuarants in charleston Id say pass on this one. You can do much better.  Very expensive</body>

        <body>Our waitress Molly was great and the food was superb, There was a loud large party in the next room, but they shut the doors which we appreciated. I thought the music could be more mellow-don&apos;t know if it was piped music, but was too &quot;rocky:&quot; Molly did turn it down so we could hold a conversation. All in all a great experience.</body>

        <body>We went here on a recomendation at the last minute.  This place is unassuming, quiet, small, intimate, and quite a find!  As appetizers, we had the recommended She-Crab Soup (DELICIOUS!!!) and the Fried Green Tomatoes (also DELICIOUS!!).  As entrees, I tried the Duo of Duck (for the first time because our server told me that it was NOT greasy the way 82 Queen did it -- and if I didn&apos;t like it, they would make it right with whatever I wanted).  The dish consisted of sliced duck breast and a confit with the duck leg and thigh.  This was served with a bing cherry compote and served with mashed root vegetables.  This dish was outrageous!  I absolutely loved it!.  Our other entree was the Carolina Crab Cakes; these cakes had no discernable filler, were huge, and were made with sweet, tender crab and lightly fried.  For dessert, we had the bourbon pecan pie with vanilla ice cream and the lemon chiffon cake.  YUM!  We&apos;re from New York and have eaten at many fabulous restaurants, but 82 Queen</body>

        <body>With all of the superb restaurants in Charleston, SC, it was hard to know where to eat with only two nights in this gem of a town. The recommendation that came from our tour guide, other hotel guests and our hotel management was 82 Queen.  Now, I would like to recommend the place to your readers. It is a lovely place, quiet and romantic without being stodgy. The chef is brilliant and the servers are professional. We ate outside in the courtyard and it was enchanting. If you only have a handful of nights in Charleston, you must dine here.</body>

        <body>Took a friend here for lunch as a birthday present, but we both received the gift of an excellent meal and friendly service in a charming ambiance.  This was probably my 4th time coming here and I&apos;m never disappointed, but I was wowed this time.  The food was outstanding. Started out with baked Brie with soft pretzels served warm out of the oven. The sweet potatoe mustard was unique and helped to make this so delicious. Then had a great stacked turkey sandwich that came with homemade chips. Oh, but the best part was the chocolate lava cake with raspberry sauce. I took half my sandwich home with me just so I could have room for this dessert. Yum.  Really enjoyed coming here, but I must say don&apos;t expect to eat a quick meal.  But then again it was truly nice to take our time, talk, enjoy our surroundings, and have great food.</body>

        <body>Our sister recommended this restaurant, which turned out to be just doors down from our hotel.  The food lived up to the recommendation.  My wife loved her Jambalaya; my fried chicken with collard greens was also very good.  Our table was in a very pretty room, well lit room.  The ambience was casually elegant and very cheerful.  We very much enjoyed our meal at 82 Queen Street.</body>

        <body>Great food and near fine dining experience. Impressive large portions for the cost. Shea crab soup, beets salad crab cakes and gumbo recommended from this visit. All lowcountry classics and favorite dishes and sides available.  Reservations recommended but not sure why they sat another party next to our table so early in the evening when the restaurant was still sort of empty at 6pm. Other than that everything was great. They gave us a nice corner convenient for bringing an 8 month old baby with us.</body>

        <body>This is not the first time I have visited 82 Queen, and we were not disappointed on a brunch visit last Saturday with a party of 4.  The weather precluded sitting outside, but the patio area had been enclosed and heated and so we almost got the impression that we were sitting outside.  The food and service were good.  We will be back.</body>

        <body>This is a long time favorite restaurant of mine especially for their crab cakes. I had not been there for about 15 years and the crabcakes were a disappointment but she crab soup was outstanding.   They are all crab meat  but not the fresh lump crab  I was expecting.</body>

        <body>We went on a date night for Restaurant Week.  The 3 for $30 menu was a great deal.  The she-crab soup was excellent, along with the fried green tomatoes. We both had the filet and they were cooked perfectly.  Too many peppercorns, but the Bloody Mary sauce was excellent.  Desserts were ok.  Overall, an enjoyable night.</body>

        <body>Each time I visit I have a lovely experience. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is just looking for a great environment to eat in the downtown Charleston area. The atmosphere is very pleasant and the staff members are welcoming. I try something different and each dish brings about a taste that is unimaginable.</body>

        <body>The service was slow and food was cold. The wine ordered for dinner was served after the entire was almost over. The manager and waitress offered to adjust the bill for the poor service but the bill was finally never adjusted. The dining room we were seated was away from the kitchen and bathrooms and had absolutely no ambiance - felt like we were seated on an outside covered porch and on a cold day it was not very comfortable</body>

        <body>We arrived on a wet evening. We  had an early dinner reservation as we were told that 6 pm was all that was left, they were so full. When we got there the two rooms in the particular building we were in had a noisy group in one and  only  another couple in ours which had five tables. We were  quickly taken care of. I ordered Jambalaya which is the signature meal. Pictures of it on the net did not match the dish I got. It was a red pile of rice in a piquant sauce with about 6 nice sized shrimp on top. I found no craw fish, peppers, or other ingredients. It was tasty  but looked more like porridge! So I was disappointed with the presentation which for 26 $ was more rice than anything else. So it was way OVER priced. My husband had pork. It was very dry, nothing special either. We asked for bottle water which took forever to arrive. Your dessert choices were very weak, all very sweet so not to our taste. It seems that the chef prepared  all meals  ahead as well  to speed up service so we</body>

        <body>I have eaten here several times over the years, and this was another birthday celebration with parents in from out of town.  We were all looking forward to the dinner.  Soup and salad were great but when the dinner came, we were overcome with salt!  3 of us had fish dishes and my husband had a steak.  The steak was great; however, the potatoes were a little undercooked.  To spend that amount of money and walk out of there disappointed is, well, disappointing.  It will probably be a while before we give it another shot.</body>

        <body>We were very disappointed......Fried greens tomatoes were greasy and rather tasteless, fried chicken was dry. Maybe it was a bad day of the week? we had dinner on Monday night.  My Salmon had a big blob of butter on top, not  needed but salmon was unremarkable. others in our party had the shrimp and grits and enjoyed the dish but again not remarkable.  Server was pleasant enough but not very attentive nor responsive.  We wont go again.</body>

        <body>I have been here several times as a local.. This time we took out of town guest for lunch and were disappointed. The time between courses was very long and my brother in law&apos;s shrimp and grits was luke warm. I realize it was very cold outside and the food needed to be brought in from another building but... too bad. Our courses took forever. We really enjoyed the she crab soup and baked brie but we kind of got bored waiting for the main course and then desert. The place was not busy so there was not really any reason for that much of a delay.</body>

        <body>We had recommendations from a relative that we should definitely eat here as it was one of her favorite spots when visiting Charleston.  We had lunch there and were just a bit disappointed.  I had the turkey sandwich.  The bread seemed stale and very dry.  My husband had the Southern Cheeseburger and the same was true for his sandwich.  The redeeming aspect of the meal for both of us was the kale salad.  Our waiter was great and promptly serviced our every need.</body>

        <body>We had dinner at 82 Queen on New Year&apos;s day in the early evening.  AT first take the restaurant appears very friendly and inviting.  And the drinks were respectable.  After the drinks, however, the evening went downhill fast.  To be brief, the fried brie was cold in the middle,  Accompanying the cold brie were two smears of stuff, one was a red overspiced apple type sauce and another larger smear of a cold sweet potato/squash thing.  This presentation should have been an embarrassment to this establishment.  I had an acceptable pork chop with  greens that were luke warm at best (ok taste but clearly not recently cooked) and a cool sweet potato cake (I think).  Perhaps because it was New Years day we shouldn&apos;t have had reasonable expectations?  Not!!!  If I am going to experience a &quot;C&quot; team presentation then I should pay &quot;C&quot; team prices.  I sincerely hope this very pleasant spot is able to pull their act together but whatever they attempt will have to be after a very comprehensive kitc</body>

        <body>This was our first visit to 82 Queen but will not be our last.  We arrived early for our reservation and enjoyed a delicious cocktail at the bar.  The bar tenders were well versed on the liquor choices. Our dinner was delicious and the service was friendly and professional.  We dined on the soft shell crab special and the crab cakes entree.  Both were excellent.</body>

        <body>We have enjoyed dining at 82 Queen on several past trips to Charleston, and were fortunate to be there during restaurant week this year.   The special menu choices were excellent, with portions much larger than we expected during a special promotion - no different than their regular menu sizes.    Absolutely the best crab cakes and she crab soup in Charleston!  The service is above excellent.  I highly recommend 82 Queen.</body>

        <body>We have always enjoyed our visits to 82 Queen and hate that this go around was not one of those wonderful visits. My fried chicken thigh was overcooked and tough so I had to send it back and the second go around, the chicken was tasteless and the &quot;garlic mashed potatoes&quot; tasted like they didn&apos;t even have salt let alone any garlic. My husband also stated that they had changed the shrimp and grits as it was now chunkier yellow grits and smaller portions. They did comp my food which I appreciated since I didn&apos;t even end up eating it however, I don&apos;t believe it will be worth another visit. It&apos;s a shame because we always look forward to a nice meal downtown.</body>

        <body>My wife and I were visiting Charleston from New Orleans.  We were directed to 82 Queen for a classic Charleston dinner and the restaurant did not disappoint.  We stayed with classic dishes such as the She Crab Soup and Shrimp &amp; Grits.  As a native New Orleanian, the Shrimp &amp; Grits were as good as any I&apos;ve had.  The service and ambiance were fantastic.  Overall, we had an outstanding meal and look forward to returning when we&apos;re back in Charleston.</body>

        <body>My wife and I went to 82 Queen on the evening of New Years Day. We were pleased that they were open. We were seated in the Library. Our server, Chcuk, was an absolute delight. He was very helpful in accomodating my wife&apos;s food allergies, and he made spot on suggestions for items on the menu. I enjoyed the She Crab Soup and Shrimp and Grits and my wife had grilled salmon and sauted spinach. The room only had about 5 tables, and all were occupied. Chucck methodically worked all 5 and the result was a happy and satisfied room. Our dinner was leisurely, and we left very satisfied.</body>

        <body>This is a great place to dine outdoors.  The trees and setting are lovely.  The food is good but not outstanding.  I would recommend the ambiance but it&apos;s more of a touristy place than an exceptional dining experience.</body>

        <body>Been here many times, never dissoppointed. Barbecue shrimp &amp; grits was the best I have ever tasted. Truly special. The pimento cheese on the fried green tomatoes was also really special. The food really has lots of flavor and it is obvious there is a very discerning chef and staff in the back ensuring that the quality of the food is top notch.   The atmosphere here is beautiful. There is a Spanish garden in the middle of the restaurant and dining there is  very relaxing.  One of my favorites. We come here again and again.</body>

        <body>Our food was excellent, generous portions, beautifully presented. But the service was so uneven. We waited at least 20 minutes until we actually had drinks, the soup then came immediately before we even had time to sip our cocktails. Then there was another huge gap waiting for entres and the long promised fesh bread only appeared after the entres were served. Hard time getting a second drink and post meal coffee......just made what could have been an excellent meal seem like a bit of an ordeal.....</body>

        <body>This was our second visit to 82 Queen, our first was last May during graduation week in Charleston. The first time was &quot;enjoyable&quot;, last week was not particularly for the price point. I had chicken stuffed with crab, lemon tarragon white rice and asparagus. The chicken was dry and overdone, the rice was very tacky with little flavor. The best part was the asparagus.</body>

        <body>This was our only disappointing dining experience in our week in South Carolina.  We ate out 3 days and nights in Greenville and 4 days and nights in Charleston. The food was mediocre.  All of our dishes were okay.  The service from hostess to waiters was mediocre.  This is not a restaurant to which I would return or recommend to others.  The restaurant is reviewed favorably in many places, but it is riding on its laurels.  Too many other wonderful places to eat.  82 Queen is not hungry to be great.</body>

        <body>This restaurant is a Charleston landmark.  The food is consistently wonderful.  The restaurant is a great place for a romantic evening or just a quiet time with Friends.   Parking is easy right across the street in the garage.   Great atmospere and trulu Charleston.  Be sure to try the shrimp and grits.  The pecan pie is homemade also.  Yum</body>

        <body>We tried several restaurants during our stay in Charleston. We were very excited about this restaurant because we were told by several people to try it. However, just like the reviews I&apos;ve read in other places the restaurant seems to be riding on it&apos;s old reviews. Out of all the restaurants we dined in this is the only one I would never return to. Our server was friendly but very inattentive. He had too much to handle. The food was completely unsatisfying. I have tried shrimp and grits and each restaurant we have eaten at and this was the only place where it was dry and pasty like glue. My dining partner it had the jambalaya and dryness was the same problem. The shrimp and both dishes work so overcooked they were chewy and rubbery. I always try to find something positive to say about a place so this is what I will say… The atmosphere is very nice and the complementary cheese biscuits are delicious! But that is not enough to bring me back to any restaurant.</body>

        <body>Its been about 30 years since I visited 82 Queen because I moved out of the area. I was so glad I went back. We did lunch there and I was reminded that the Charleston She Crab soup is the best I&apos;ve ever had. I love that they bring it and tell you to give the sherry a stir because its still floating on top. I won&apos;t wait another 30 years to come back I promise.</body>

        <body>Great outdoor dining with outstanding service.  The fried green tomatoes were scrumptious!  I want a bucket of the pimiento cheese and a gallon of the bacon marmalade.  French pork chop was well cooked, tender and flavorful.  Loved the sweet potato mash, and the spinach was cooked just right.  Enjoyed the staff and the courtyard.  A great touch of Charleston.</body>

        <body>Made reservation for resturant week.  I have eaten there before and found it much better when it wasn&apos;t resturant week. Rainy night but they had us walk all the way to the back of the resturant and up slippery outside stairs.  Our waiter was friendly enough but seemed to miss a few things like the bread and butter--it never showed up even after a few requests.  My guest had the pork dish which was fantastic.  The portion was large and the taste was great.  Highly recommend it.  I had the filet and it was very disappointing .  The portion was very small and tough--perhaps a smaller plate would help it may not not look so lost on the plate. Tables by the windows were very close and the table behind us kept hitting our chairs.  All in all not so great experience.</body>

        <body>Started well at the bar waiting for our table. Vodka martini was ample with choice of vodka. Good selection of wines by the glass for my wife. As is customary in Charleston, the resturant offered a special New Year&apos;s menu. Lamb chops were excellent as was the turf portion (filet mignon) of &quot;land &amp; sea.&quot; The lobster tail might have benefited from a sauce but was certainly acceptable. A shared dessert and fresh coffee ended this enjoyable experience. This is not our first visit to 82 Queen and will not be the last due to the consistency, ambiance and good service.</body>

        <body>even thought the reservation was made 1 1/2 months in advance, we were seated at a table beside a storage room and a wait staff hub.  Way too much activity in and out of the room and imagine trying to have a romantic Valentines dinner with the wait staff constantly loading and unloading dirty &amp; clean plates 2 feet from you.  the location and staff activity totally ruined our evening</body>

        <body>It was a beautiful night and we made reservations weeks ahead.  Lots of areas within the restaurant that are beautiful, but we were put at table &quot;301&quot;.  It was upstairs on the 3rd floor with a table much too small for a meal with bread basket and wine glasses. I did not ask for a picture to be taken of us because all of the lighting, music, and air controls were beside us and would be our background. The waiters were excellent.  Welcoming, professional, and efficient.  She-crab soup was divine!! Great pecan pie for dessert!  I ordered shrimp and grits- one of my favorite dishes.  Did not pay attention to the details of the dish because bbq sauce is used….. not my favorite way to have this dish.  Overall- 82 Queen is a great restaurant and I will go again.  I will just request my area of seating!</body>

        <body>MY wife and I tried the Brunch for the very first time and 82 Queen did not disappoint!   The Low-Country Omlet was succulent mixed with spinach and Gouda cheese! The coffee had that deep, rich aroma that partnered well with the Omlet! The ambiance at &quot;The Queen&quot; has always been our favorite in the Charleston area....filled with the period of a time of luxurious living before the Civil War! The wait-staff was very attentive.....and everyone wore a warm smile that projected the intent of a &quot;true welcome greeting&quot;!!! Definitely...one of...if not.... the BEST in Charleston!!!!</body>

        <body>We had a nice birthday dinner with wonderful scallops and she crab soup. Our friendly and knowledgeable waitress also recommended the &quot;Freak Show&quot; Cabernet and it is now one of our favourites. Will definitely return to this restaurant when we have the opportunity to visit Savannah again.</body>

        <body>My husband and I went to Charleston for the Valentine&apos;s weekend.  Everyone, including our carriage tour guide,  said 82 Queen was the place to go.  Valentine&apos;s day the restaurant was fully booked so we made reservations for Sunday night.  After so much hype we were expecting the meal of our life.  We were thoroughly disappointed.  The famous &quot;she crab soup&quot; was inedible.  The famous &quot;shrimp and grits&quot; we not good at all.  The crab cake appetizer and the jambalaya were okay but not near what we expected from a restaurant of this caliber.  The biscuits were cold and so was our dining room.  This dinner was our big splurge for the weekend and I am sad to say it was not worth the time or the money.</body>

        <body>Sat at outside table next to gate connecting to bed &amp; breakfast. We began to smell a strong chlorine odor. At the same time my husband was being dripped on. We were sitting under a tree. We told our server the two issues   He chuckled as he said the Rose of Sharon drips as it blooms.  I&apos;ve checked with a couple of nurseries since &amp; they say they have never heard nor had the experience that that is true.  The dinner was not as special as we had hoped. We specifically chose 82 Queen over many other quality restaurants in the area because we had gone there on our 5th anniversary &amp; we were back in town 30 years later. Wish it had been different.</body>

        <body>This was our second time here, and it was every bit as good as the first.  In addition to the interesting menu and great food, the restaurant&apos;s layout is most unique. Built around a courtyard and a huge tree, you may be eating upstairs, inside, outside or sort of in-between, all of which are ok in any weather and add to the ambiance. You&apos;ll want to try their she crab soup; traditional but not ordinary.  Highly satisfied with service, food and ambiance.</body>

        <body>We made reservations at 82 Queen to celebrate my wife&apos;s birthday on a recent trip to Charleston, S.C.  Upon arriving at the restaurant, we were warmly greeted and escorted to an upper room (there are several such rooms, each with localized names).  Our waiter was handling about 4 other tables in the room that particular night and so the greeting and drink order was somewhat delayed.  After a relaxing and solitary time to enjoy our drinks, our orders were placed.  I had the she crab soup, which was very good.  My wife ordered the prime rib and I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Both dishes took an extra ordinary long  time to be presented to our table, given the fact this was a mid-week evening and the restaurant was sparsely occupied.  The food was very good, even though the prices were higher than I expected them to be.  All in all a very enjoyable evening but at a price that is in excess of the level of enjoyment.</body>

        <body>We have always loved the food at 82 Queen; however,on this occasion, two out of three of us were finished with our meal as the third was being served.  Add to this the fact that two in our party are handicapped and they could only accommodate us two flights up (with no apologies from the manager) we may have to rethink our next visit.  They didn&apos;t seem busy on the first floor, but the manager was firm that it was upstairs or we could not be accommodated.  She was not exhibiting the usual 82 Queen courtesy.  My favorite Charleston restaurant has disappointed me.</body>

        <body>This was the second time to dine at 82 Queen and was memorable in that we were the only diners in the entire dining room. We were told that the evening we were there is traditionally the slowest of the year. Food was very good, but a bit slow getting to us. Fun waiter who was very helpful. We would definitely go back, but hope for a more vibrant evening.</body>

        <body>We have eaten here several times in the past so we picked it for my wife&apos;s birthday celebration. The waiter recommended the Osco Buco, so we both ordered it from the Restaurant Week menu.  Mine was fall-apart perfect, but my wife&apos;s was very tough.  Since it was rather cool outside that evening, we did not send it back as it took more than 30 minutes to get the first entires. We switched plates and I tried to eat the tough meat, but it was not a good experience. We are going to count this as one bad experience, and we will return in warmer weather to try again.</body>

        <body>The location was great for a pre theater dinner, and the service was wonderful and the atmosphere  in keeping with the neighborhood.  Alas, the food did not match the rest of the experience.  The she crab soup was just ok, and the fried pork chop had too much crust and was over cooked.</body>

        <body>We chose 82 Queen to celebrate my birthday and a good friend&apos;s birthday.  We ate here during Charleston Restaurant week which meant a fixed 3 course menu for $30.  The choices were excellent and the preparation was outstanding.  Our waiter was very attentive and well seasoned.  It was a wonderful evening with friends and a great place for our celebration.</body>

While our food was truly very good, it was not outstanding nor was the presentation.  Would I go back? Yes, to try something different; but, I would try one of the other outstanding restaurants in Charleston first..</body>

        <body>We found 82 Queen on Open Table and the reviews made us want to come . They were right! The restaurant is a lovely, quaint, elegant setting combining charming indoor dining rooms and delightful outdoor (but sheltered) patio tables. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful to our group of seven, and almost everything was perfect. I say almost everything because one chicken dish came out undercooked; it was quickly replaced with a comped entree and generous apologies.  The barbecue shrimp and grits, the she-crab soup, the fried green tomatoes, the hush puppies, the jambalaya... all were excellent. The cocktails were also delicious, and the wine selection was quite good. We should have saved more room for dessert! As it was, we ordered one piece of bourbon pecan pie and passed it around the table so everyone could have a bite. Heavenly!  This is a terrific special occasion restaurant, and definitely romantic. I&apos;m sure they&apos;ve seen more than their fair share of proposals! We will be </body>

        <body>82 Queen never fails to amaze us. We specifically went to Charleston to eat here. The she-crab soup is crave worthy and my husband said his shrimp and grits was the best he&apos;s had. The outdoor seating is amazing, even in cool weather. The staff is fun and knowledgable. It&apos;s a great find. It has a unique setting and the food is so good, you&apos;ll want to bring your friends!</body>

        <body>A reservation for an early dinner on Christmas Eve was confirmed by phone the day before, which is unusual. As our meal progressed the reason for the call was apparent; the restaurant became packed, but with no fuss. The service was excellent, exceptionally professional and friendly. We both had grouper that was perfectly prepared.  It was served on a bed of succatash garnished with fried okra.   The entire meal experience was outstanding and was topped off by attending a Christmas Eve service at St. Philips.</body>

        <body>It was a cold night in Charleston and the hostess accommodated our request not to sit in a makeshift outdoor room warmed by a space heater.  We had to wait a few minutes past our 6:30 reservation but were given a lovely corner table with a view of Queen Street in a small room.   We ordered from the  restaurant week menu. Three out of four opted for she crab soup and the peppercorn filet. #4 had the picklin&apos; plate and pork osso buco.   Two out of three steaks were done as requested; the osso buco was falling off the bone and tasty with collards, garlic mashed potatoes and carrots.  Desserts were first rate. The noise level was more than moderate with a group of women sitting behind us. Service was excellent and professional. The pace was good and we weren&apos;t rushed. Glad to have used Open Table when I heard hostess turning away walk-ins with next tables available at 9:30.</body>

        <body>We went on a Thursday night, so maybe that&apos;s why it was so quiet (which is nice) but I also like a great ambience to go with my food to create a great dining experience. The service was great and so was the food, so overall it was awesome! The BBQ Shrimp and Grits are amazing!</body>

        <body>We have been to 82 Queen every visit to Charleston over the past 20 years. This time was our last. When the waitress served our appetizers she said this must be the all carb table. That got us a look from the next table. When my meal came it was missing the gravy that is with the chicken and the brussel sprouts were so hard I could not get a fork in them. When we told her she said she was bringing the manager out. I said don&apos;t bring them just take it off the bill which she DID NOT do. Very disappointed in the experience and the service has gone down hill this much.</body>

        <body>I had heard about this restaurant from some friends, and let me say upfront I am not a seafood eater. I ordered the hamburger that came with a fried egg and bacon. I ordered it well done. It came out VERY pink. I should have sent it back, but I don&apos;t like to make a fuss, so I tried to eat it. Not successful. My dining partner had the crabcake BLT. and she was underwhelmed. She said she would just go for the she crab soup, and be very happy.</body>

        <body>We went here for the $30 three-course meal that was promoted during &quot;Restaurant week&quot;.  The soup was excellent.  The dessert was excellent. The entrée was only OK.  I ordered the Peppercorn Encrusted Filet Mignon.  The filet was cooked to perfection.  I didn&apos;t care for the peppercorn, but I should have known that going in.  However, the sides provided were three of the thinnest asparagus you will ever see and Inedible &quot;confit fingerling potatoes&quot;. They were hard as a rock.  I would have preferred a hearty dose of the garlic mashed potatoes that accompanied another entrée.  I don&apos;t understand the logic in serving these &quot;chips&quot; with a perfectly prepared steak.  The service was excellent.  The place was nice.</body>

        <body>This restaurant was a real disappointment. While the ambiance was quite nice with a series of small dining rooms, the menu was uninteresting. The signature dish of BBQ Shrimp and grits tasted as if it had been prepared weeks ago. Service was adequate although in my opinion a restaurant of this caliber should get the right orders to the customers on the first try. Also I was surprised that in this day and age there was no espresso machine.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are many better choices in Charleston.</body>

        <body>We were in awe as we first walked in by the pure beauty of the place. From patio seating with outdoor heaters to the upstairs dining area, where we ended up had such a wonderful ambiance. The She crab soup was delicious! The best crab cakes that I have ever tasted! The staff was completely knowledgeable about the dishes and helped with our food choices. The staff was extremely attentive and classy in every way. We ended our dinner with a chocolate cheesecake which was just as divine as the rest of our meal. We will definitely be returning customers of 82 Queen!</body>

        <body>WE were seated promptly for Sunday brunch. The outside area is beautiful. The inside is fine. Our meal arrived within seconds of our drinks. The waiter was constantly removing dishes while others were eating. He even brought dessert menus when someone was finishing their meal. The food was very average compared to other brunches in the city.</body>

        <body>Their barbecue shrimp and grits was a dish to die for.  It looked great and tasted great unlike the same dish we had at SNOB a night before, which was totally tasteless.  Jambalaya could have been better., and it was more or less on dry side., however. The outdoor setting on a beautiful spring sunny day mad our lunch more enjoyable and memorable.</body>

        <body>We always eat here when we travel to Charleston for sentimental reasons, have been going here for over 20 years. I love the outdoor setting, which on a cold night is supplemented with heaters. Very beautiful and romantic atmosphere. Our food this vista was not exceptional, the soup special of tomato/ artichoke was not very palatable and the mahi with lemon butter sauce was well cooked, however the sauce was just a pool of melted butter that did not enhance the flavor of the fish at all.  However, we will be back next visit to the area and hope that this was just a blip on an otherwise lovely dining destination.</body>

        <body>The service was slow, even though we intentionally made an early reservation and informed the wait staff that we had to be out by a certain time for a concert.  Then when we had to send back one of the entrees back because it was grossly overcooked to the point of being burnt,  we were late for the concert and my husband was able to eat only half of the replacement entree.  This made the entire dining experience at 82 Queen much less than satisfactory.</body>

        <body>It was restaurant week and we hoped to be able to go to a very nice place like 82Queen for a reasonable price ($30 each for fixed/limited 3 course).  First our table was in the back upstairs, but by a cold door - every time someone entered there was a blast of cold air.  The She Crab soup was fishy, the Chicken gumbo as ok, but on the cold side.  Shrimp and Grits was nothing to write home about (we had Shrimp and Grits at Pearlz the night before and THEY were spectacular).  The Jambalaya - was ok, but too heavy on tomato  and frankly I make better at home.  Desserts were ok, but they waiter did not even ask if we wanted coffee.  Wine was very pricy - overpriced even for a fancy restaurant.  It cost almost as much as our meals for 2 and that was a low end wine.    Some other guests we met at the Elliot Inn we stayed at (next door to 82Queen) has suggested Magnolia&apos;s - we wish we had gone there instead.  Very disappointed with 82Queen.</body>

        <body>We had the she crab soup and Jambalaya.  The soup was a bit disappointing.  The Jambalya was delicious despite the overcooked and hard pieces of ham.  There were plenty od shrimp and crawfish to make up for that.</body>

        <body>Decent food. I got the surf and turf which was very tasty. I would recommend getting a southern dish there instead. Halls or Oak definitely make a better steak. They were also out of 2 out of the 3 bottles of wine we requested.</body>

        <body>So after hearing all the hype about ABC Kitchen I finally decided to go done with my father for old times sake and have a nice dinner. Upon entering we were quickly seated and the waiter was nice and informed throughout our dinner about recommendations and all. The food came quickly and was actually quite good overall. My father complained about the complexity of the spices though on the Salmon dish he ordered but he still enjoyed this dinner. I had the Mushroom Pizza and an order of the Crab Toast. Both were excellent and very well made. Best Mushroom pizza I&apos;ve ever had by far; everything about it was excellent. Fresh/pure ingredients, right amount of flavor and the crust was thin and crunchy.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been waiting for a long time to have dinner at ABC and finally went with my boyfriend for our anniversary. I noted that in our reservation and the staff really went out of their way to make it a special evening for us. From a nicer table to complimentary champagne, appetizers, and dessert, it added such a nice feeling to an already beautiful atmosphere. Overall, the experience was more memorable than the food, but only by a little. The burger that my boyfriend ordered will haunt my dreams, and I would definitely go back to see if maybe I didn&apos;t try the dishes that people usually love.</body>

        <body>I’d wanted to lunch at the uptown Jean-Georges during my recent visit to NYC but could not get a reservation, so I chose Vongerichten’s more casual 18th St. restaurant instead. I also liked the idea that the restaurateur uses only locally sourced organic ingredients here.   Except for atmosphere, I frankly can’t imagine that the uptown dining could have been any more elegant than this. The restaurant’s Flatiron District location fills it with working New Yorkers for lunch, with a few tourists (like me) and tony suburban women thrown in. (If any celebrities were here for lunch, I wouldn’t have known it.) I chose the $32 three-course prix-fixe meal. The starter,  cream of cauliflower soup, was exceptional, with a creamy, well-flavored base, small florets to bite into, deep-fried croutons for crunch, and a swirl of chili oil for a whisper of heat. My main course was perfectly pan-seared mackerel in a sauce accented with capers and small crunchy bits. Slices of crusty whole-wheat baguette</body>

        <body>Eager to add ABC Cocina to our list of go-to NYC eateries but, unlike ABC Kitchen, food was not exciting.   Other than tasty (albeit outrageously expensive) tacos, dishes were underwhelming, especially the rather bland guacamole at $15!), Lilliputian-sized charred octopus (more potatoes than octopus), minuscule beets, crab balls that needed punch.  Not worth a return visit.</body>

        <body>Been to NYC many times and have had meals at the best of the best and ABC Kitchens ranks right up there!!  Wonderful lunch!!  Everyone at the table had different things and everyone raved about their meal!  Crab toast exquisite!  Sea bass done perfectly!  And even though I was stuffed after several shared appetizers and cauliflower soup, I had to try to salted caramel ice cream! Best meal on this trip!!  Would highly recommend to anyone!!</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve lived in NYC two years and hands down, ABC Kitchen has the best food in town! Everything seems to simply melt in your mouth.  The waiters and hosts are attentive through out the evening. They are very helpful and provide attention to small details. Getting a table for dinner is not easy as it is so popular. You need to book in advance or get lucky.</body>

        <body>The hostess was very helpful in helping me add a person to my reservation. She let us occupy a table if we promised to leave by a certain time.  We all ordered the prefix lunch and was extremely happy with our choice as the portions were very generous and the food was delicious. We ordered the orange tart whichturned out to be a huge piece of cake with orange curd. We will definitely be back.</body>

        <body>First time in New York, all my friends recommended if I wanted to go to ABC Kitchen I would need to book in advance and so after all the hype, I booked about 3weeks in advance and there were both lunch and dinner spots open.  We went to a lunch service on a busy Friday afternoon and our server was very helpful and friendly. We had the amazing squash toast, pizza and pasta. The cold press juices were just what we needed and the ambience was very trendy New York. Similar to a Chiltern Firehouse vibe for Londoners.  I would definitely go again.</body>

        <body>I had lunch with my two teen-age daughters, one an adventuresome eater, one looking for simple, familiar dishes. The restaurant was perfect for this range. One daughter started with  the tuna sashimi in a flavorful marinade. The other had a spinach pizza hold the spinach. I had raviolo filled with light, rich fresh ricotta in a rich parmesan, sage, pork ragu--rich but delicious. We each had a salted caramel sunday with popcorn.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to ABC Kitchen a handful of times. I&apos;m always pleased with the food but have come to learn  poor staff is something I should also expect.  As a patron I am made to feel like I am inconveniencing them by asking to place an order. During my last visit I had to ask management if my table had a waiter as we sat for 15 minutes without water or menus. I don&apos;t plan on returning to ABC Kitchen for quite some time as great food in Manhattan is a given but I also expect great service.</body>

        <body>ABC has held a high standard from day one. The young staff is quick and polite. the menu is vast, fresh and excellent. We had two different soups on a very cold day and all commented they were so tasty (squash and cauliflower) that another bowl could have been lunch. Shrimp salad, salmon salad and the spicy turkey sandwich capped off a great meal. Never falters.</body>

So before you go look at the menu. While everything was absolutely delicious not what I was looking for.</body>

        <body>Spot on. Table is ready; crowd is vibrant; service is there but not bothersome; the food is prepared to your liking. Cannot go wrong. Enjoyed butternut squash soup; a salmon salad and super tasty burger. A O K!</body>

        <body>This was one of the worst restaurant experiences ever. Waitied about 20 min in spite of having a reservation. Ordered a cauliflower soup, shrimp salad and ice cream. Soup was simultaneously bland and painfully salty. Sent it back for the other soup special, which was just bland. Salad had dirty lettuce, as in large clots of dirt, with shrimp tasted straight from the freezer bag. I told the waiter that the dishes were simply inedible. The kitchen sent out a scoop of ice cream-- with a large black hair sticking out of the side. We did end up getting our lunch check comped, but still, 90 minutes of sitting and I left hungry and guilty for wasting food by sending it back, but it was truly inedible. But the hot dog off the street I ended up having for lunch hit the spot!</body>

        <body>We had a bad table where servers and waitstaff were continuously passing through.  We had brunch and the food was okay, nothing fantastic. Our waiter was terrible and unapologetic when the wrong starter came out. I am shocked that so many things went wrong at a Jean-George restaurant.  I will not go back.</body>

        <body>The quality of the food was very good. I had the mushroom pizza with the runny egg in the middle which turns out to be my favorite pizza in N.Y.C. I had cod for my fish entree. I thought it prepared perfectly.  I think they do an excellent job for what they do but that they are bit too conservative or classical for my tastes, not a lot of bold flavors or cutting edge creativity. I view it as a good place for lunch.</body>

        <body>Love the relaxed vibe in the super-chic interior. A certain mid-western ease combined with a highly-sophisticated NYC design aesthetic. We do regular business lunches here and they never cease to please our guests and colleagues at the table.  Want to go there forever more.  Only gripe, getting a reservation, especially for dinner, can be a challenge. Start now.</body>

        <body>Dinner at ABC was an incredible experience from the moment we walked into the room past the creatively designed bar sitting next to the tree that looks like driftwood. The beet salad, crab toast, fried chicken, and pesto pasta made this a memorable  occasion.  Can&apos;t wait to return.</body>

        <body>A friend had tipped me off about the ABC restaurant but booking a table for dinner wasn&apos;t easy so I decided to try for a late lunch instead and got a table for two for 3 pm.  The restaurant is located in the basement of  the ABC Market which my wife and I had visited earlier and we decided to enter from the store rather than directly from the 18th Street entrance which looked rather uninviting from outside. However we were politely directed to the Maitre d&apos; just inside the street entrance, where we were greeted in a friendly manner and shown to our table.  The restaurant is large with tables close together, so listening to neighbouring conversation is unavoidable. Luckily for us, however, there were not many people in the place at the odd hour we had chosen - and the couple at the table beside ours spoke in Japanese. We only ate a main course  - a spicy prawn salad, which our waitress warned was VERY spicy and offered to have the chili vinaigrette separately on the side. A wise precau</body>

        <body>Great ambiance, service, appetizers, &amp; drinks. It was a long meal and I was comfortable and enjoying my time at the restaurant. Appetizers and market table selections were delicious. Entrees were a bit disappointing; sea bass was drowned in a potent sauce and salmon was okay. Would return but maybe not order any entrees.</body>

        <body>The food and service was outstanding at ABC Kitchen. It was my first time at this restaurant for brunch after having made reservations over a month in advance. It was well worth it. The food which is organic was fresh and tasty.  The service very attentive.   There was so much on the menu to choose from and everything sounded so good. I would definitely go back to try other items.  If you&apos;ve never been, you should try to go. Just make sure you make reservations weeks in advance.</body>

        <body>No question about good food menue as well as drink menue. Great ingredients, emphasizing local and organic and sense of seasonality adds anpther value.  Dishes I&apos;ve tried so far were all impressive, exceeding my expectations. Among those, I highly recommend: -crab toast withlemonaioli -mushroom toast, pecorino, lemonand herbs -tomato toast (I believe only during the summer) -housemadeyogurt withgranola and housemadejam -frenchtoast withvanilla poached pears (fruit is seasonal). I can confidently say this frenchtoast is the best in the city ai&apos;ve tried so far for the past 10 years -akaushi cheeseburger withherbed mayoand pickled jalapenos  Interior adds another reason to go to this restaurant. Service is very good with friendly but knowledgeable servers</body>

        <body>I went to ABC many years ago when it was new, and was incredibly impressed. But now, with so many other restaurants doing great things with vegetables, I was wondering how they would compare. Still absolutely excellent!  One of the best beet dishes I&apos;ve ever had. The cauliflower soup was divine. I am not a vegetarian but like to eat healthier when I can, and at a place like ABC it is sumptuous to have vegies, not depriving. Too bad it&apos;s expensive. My one complaint is they are almost too fastidious with table service, hovering, taking plates away too quickly. But the servers were all very nice, so I feel badly criticizing them!</body>

        <body>We had a salmon sushi and a calamari starter. Both were tasty. The veg main and the lobster were also very good. If you still have room try the sundae with chocolate sauce and popcorn it is very moreish. The service was attentive but not intrusive and we were not rushed . We would go back and do it all again.</body>

        <body>Nice to have outstanding food and good service in a relaxed atmosphere.  The special lunch is always a great bargain.  The a la carte menu is excellent, although on New Year&apos;s Day I hoped for a few &quot;brunch type&quot; choices and there were none.</body>

        <body>We had been there for lunch before but this tine we went just for the ice cream sundae dessert.  I made a reservation for late in the lunch hour and there were 4 of us.  The ice cream sundae was as amazing as it had been before. Well worth the trip.   However the server apparently was not happy about the fact that we were only ordering dessert.  Once she understood that we became less than important to her.  She went through a ritual of removing our sliverware and placemats that was oddly uncomfortable and felt to all of us like we were being punished.   She became hard to contact and it took quite some time to get our check.  It is a shame that she saw it as inconvenient to have to serve us dessert.  I would have made up for it in the tip had she treated us properly.  Having been there before I know that the service is not normally so unfriendly.  Therefore I would not give a bad review.  I recommend that they council their servers.  They never know who they are serving.   We had tak</body>

        <body>Eating out can just play havoc with any healthy lifestyle so this place is an absolute gem, not only is the food totally delicious but it&apos;s very possible to eat healthily. There are an enormous amount of vegetable options and it&apos;s possible to convert the food to vegan. Ate an amazing dairy free soup that was on the specials the evening we went. Great atmosphere, great server and really not uber expensive in the big scheme of manhattan dining. $160 for 2 including tip and a couple of drinks. No wonder it is impossible to get a table - enjoy!</body>

        <body>Second time we&apos;ve dined here and still does not disappoint.  The menu offers a wide variety and the food is definitely top notch / high quality.  Fresh ingredients stand out and the flavor combinations really leave a lasting impression.  We started with there &quot;staple&quot; appetizers: the crab toast and the roasted carrots with avocado salad.  Meat, fresh lumps of crab sit atop a buttered toast - add the twist of lemon for acidity, and this one&apos;s a winner.  The roasted carrots &amp; avocado also complement each other well - just the right amount of &quot;smokiness&quot; in the carrots to go with the fresh, creamy avocado.  For the mains, we had their burger &amp; the fried chicken.  While the burger patty may not have been the star of the burger, the combo with the pickled jalapenos really made the burger stand out overall.  Fried chicken was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  Couldn&apos;t mop up enough of their &quot;hot butter&quot; sauce.  Ended up skipping dessert as we were stuffed, but we know their famous popcorn ic</body>

        <body>Our Sunday brunch far exceeded our expectations as the menu provided locally sourced organic ingredients which were artfully presented with innovation but with a total lack of fussiness.    Our party of three choose hake that was delicately seasoned with celery and mint and the wood fired pizza with spinach and goat cheese and herbs.   Desserts were a moist carrot cake with a sinful cream cheese icing and a French orange tart that was served with fresh whipped cream, per our request.  Scrumptious All!</body>

        <body>I was really excited to visit ABC kitchen because I love Mercer Kitchen, but the service made the experience much worse than I expected. Our waitress pressured us to order entrees even though we decided on share plates, and she rushed our meal. I would have enjoyed the experience much more with a less judgemental and overbearing waiter.</body>

        <body>I highly recommend ABC kitchen to anyone who can get a reservation.  The staff was very attentive and nice, but not pretentious.  We went for brunch on my birthday.  The asparagus omelette, french toast and house made ravioli were all amazing.   Every bite was perfect and I left overjoyed.  The pastry chef made a tiny chocolate cupcake to help us to celebrate, which was the most wonderful cherry on top of this beautiful culinary experience.</body>

        <body>The decor is stunning and interesting.  Our server was friendly, attentive but not overly so, well-informed and quite helpful.  We had the beets and yogurt, which were delicious and a great flavor combination. I had the salmon salad.  I wouldn&apos;t order it again. There were several different textures competing on the plate (a thick coating of sesame seeds on the salmon, large unchopped herbs and lettuce leaves).  It distracted me from the flavors of the dish.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, however.  We had two of the house-made flavored sodas, and they were quite delicious.</body>

        <body>I went here for a birthday dinner, and it was a lovely space -- surprisingly spacious and airy, and an artful combination of rustic and extravagant. The food was delightful, and of a perfect portion size. The fried chicken was flavorful (a favorite of the table), and the crab toast had a refreshing kick. Although I appreciate the locally sourced ingredients and the ambience, the food (while delicious) was not mind-blowing enough to warrant the price tag. It was still a great experience overall, and worth it for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>One of the best dining experiences in my life. There is something for everyone here; fantastic drinks, the best darn burger you can buy, a perfectly seasoned sea bass, sustainable and responsibly sourced ingredients, amazing ambience, hand-made and vintage earthenware... But somehow they manage to pull it off without pretense.  Your foodie blogger gym buddy will love it just as much as your grandma.</body>

        <body>I have been to ABC Kitchen before and enjoyed it, but the food we had from the brunch menu on Saturday 3/21/15 was NOT good.  We started with mushroom toast and fluke crudo.  The toast had a piece of cold pecorino cheese on it and vinegar soaked cold mushrooms on top.  I was expecting savory warm mushrooms with melted pecorino.  The menu should better explain this item because I would have not ordered it.  the fluke itself was fine but it was covered in way to much tapenade of some kind and dill that was totally overpowering (similar to the mushrooms).  We then split a veal meatball pasta and bass filet.  We asked for them separate but they came at the same time.  The pasta literally was drenched in  the most reduced onion tapenade.  We asked about the type of sauce on this dish before were ordered it, and was told it had a brown sauce (not really true OR the sauce was way over-reduced).  There was barely any pasta, it was like eating some weird onion jam.  The meatballs were fine, bu</body>

        <body>We visited ABC Kitchen for lunch and found both the food and the service to be outstanding. The service staff were all friendly and attentive while the menu offered a wide range of choices (even some nice craft beer for me to try on the drinks menu). The food could not be faulted for both taste and presentation.</body>

        <body>ABC Kitchen was busy !! Not a single table free busy.  It was hard getting a table here. I booked 4 weeks in advance and there was still no chance of an evening reservation. It was also a little hard to find, small sign and no idea of what is behind the door until you are inside.  Service was excellent. All the servers looked very young, but they were knowledgable and clearly passionate about their jobs. Even though I was alone I got a great table with a good view of the restaurant.  Water was quick to arrive as was an explanation of the daily specials.  I chose the lunch fixed price 3 courses.  I chose a tuna sashimi to start - it was amazing. I could of eaten it ten times over. The marinade was slightly spicy and absolutely delicious.  My main was a fresh egg and ricotta ravioli served with pork ragu. The ravioli actually contained a whole fresh perfectly egg with ricotta cheese. The egg broke as I cut into the ravioli. It was a very pleasant surprise as from the description I thoug</body>

        <body>I took my bridesmaids here for a Sunday brunch. I totally screwed up the initial reservations and forgot to include myself, but ABC Kitchen was extremely accommodating and helped me out with a lovely 5 person table, even though they were completely booked. Super classy.  We had amazing drinks--two Bellinis and three lemonades with vodka thyme. Delicious. Then we split the cheddar biscuits and a margarita pizza that had the freshest mozzarella cheese on it. I had the fried oysters over scrambled eggs. The scrambled eggs could have been cheese. They were delicious. Everyone enjoyed their orders--French toast, Salmon, Eggs Benedict.  We finished the meal with every desert on the menu. Nom. So Good. An excellent bridesmaid luncheon!</body>

        <body>It&apos;s lame to me that a restaurant with the ethos of ABC Kitchen would be so prohibitive when it comes to actually getting a table there. I love the food — it&apos;s my favorite restaurant by far in the city. I just wish I could get in a little more often.</body>

        <body>One of my favorite spot to eat at in manhattan! it&apos;s rustic yet stylish at the same time! I love the service, people were very welcoming and nice!  They come up to you and assist you when you look lost! I usually come here for brunch because i love the ambiance during that time! food has always been very consistent, and always are above average! For first timer dining in for brunch! YOU HAVE TO ORDER THEIR &quot;FRENCH TOAST&quot; it will be the most amazing piece of french toast you&apos;ll ever have!!!!!  warm, chewy, sweet and thick!!!</body>

        <body>A bit slow to start, but once the server arrived she was outstanding! She knew the menu inside and out.  A+  The atmosphere is lovely as well! I could sit in there all day! The food is delicious....the roasted beets, the crab toast, the pear and apple salad! The burger was perfect and the mushroom pizza was very flavorful! Very enjoyable girls lunch!!</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve eaten at sister restaurant ABC Cocina a few times since it&apos;s easier to get a reservation.  There&apos;s a reason.  I&apos;ve not been impressed with ABC Cocina but I was very happy dining at ABC Kitchen.  It&apos;s too bad Cocina isn&apos;t equally delicious and inventive.  Had brunch at ABC Kitchen with a friend who goes often for lunch and dinner.  The crab toast was like nothing I&apos;ve ever tasted, a must try for anyone who enjoys crab.  I thought Bubby&apos;s biscuit was the only good biscuit in town - but the cheddar biscuits at ABC Kitchen will definitely be a future repeat.  The scrambled eggs with fried oysters were good (soft scrambled - yum).  And the coffee was rich and hot.  Will be back!</body>

        <body>Great space for lunch. Spaced out tables with ambient lighting (despite the fact that it gets very dark when its sunny outside) creates a noce atmosphere.  Food is delicious. The beet salad, hake, seabass, all pizzas are yummy. Kale salad could&apos;ve been better - it was simply kale on a plate, not very developed in terms of depth. Overall, tasty food with great presentation.  Sundae with popcorn was fun.  Service was OK, nothing alarming. Overall smiling and helpful staff.  Will definitely go again.</body>

        <body>My daughter and I had lunch here and the food was superb, service great and the cocktails even better. It was good to have such fresh, tasty and beautifully cooked food and the interior of the restaurant is trendy and fun. Would certainly recommend booking well in advance. My only &apos;complaint&apos; is that it is not too easy to find, we stood outside the actual restaurant for a minute or two before realising it was there - better signage please.</body>

        <body>The facade is understated - almost hidden in a street void of a significant personality. The distressed doors leading into &apos;ABC Kitchen&apos; only elude to what I find inside. Here I am greeted warmly and as lead into an interior which becomes more enchanting as if C.S. Lewis himself has crafted the scene.. Exposed beams, and robust concrete columns all softened by &apos;installations&apos; of hanging branches and bulbs creating an atmosphere that is both chic and romantic. The detail is perfect with mismatched china on a crisp white table.  I am here alone and there is no hiding me in a corner as I enjoy excellent service by all the Staff from the time  I check my coat to when I leave. The Food and Drinks menu are easy to navigate as I select a crisp French Pinot. The cocktails arriving at other tables look very good. I am delighted by my food choices. Crab Toast for a Starter, a generous serve of fresh crab piled  high on a flavoursome thick bread which is crisp with a sesame hint but soft on my p</body>

        <body>I have yet to be disappointed by restaurants on Eater38, but this one was particularly wonderful!  Three of us went for a late lunch (only time we could get a last minute reservation).  One in our party got the prix-fix, which was a great value.  She said the fish was the best she had ever had (and we live on the coast in Florida).  The butternut squash soup was delightful and the burger that I had was unique and yummy!  My sister had the  Brussel sprout pizza, which was very substantial and delicious.  But the very BEST thing I tasted that day was the sundae with the caramel ice cream and candied popcorn.  WOW!  Truly I&apos;m not even much of an ice cream person, but I would go back there just to order that!   You will not be disappointed with ABC Kitchen.  The staff and service was fantastic and even though it looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, it is beautiful and refreshing as soon as you walk in.</body>

        <body>If I lived in a funky, chandelier-decorated farm house, it would look just like this. The space is clean, warm, and fun -- you even get to debate whose plate is prettiest (they are all different). Prix fixe lunch is a fantastic value (although we were very full when we finished).  Tuna starter was magical, and beet salad over yogurt was creamy and delicious. Chicken paillard was perfectly cooked and there were lots of root veggies alongside. Desserts were sinful, whimsical (salted caramel sundae with peanuts &amp; kettle corn), very chocolate (rich cake).  Can&apos;t wait to go back!</body>

        <body>Wonderful lunch in this foodie haven. If you cannot get in for dinner highly recommend trying for lunch. A fixed price lunch option available and an excellent value. I had the Fluke, outstanding, and the pasta Carbonara also quite good. Total food bliss. Rhubarb mimosa started the afternoon stop and was delicious.   Casual, beautiful interiors and not for the penny pincher. WELL worth the effort to get a reservation. Loved the entire experience from the food, to the china, decor, wait staff, the energy of the whole place provides a superb dining experience.</body>

        <body>This was the first time my husband and i had visited New York from Australia and ABC kitchen was top priority on our Itinerary. Having been recommended by numerous friends &amp; acquaintances we made sure we reserved our table before we left Australia, booking was a must as the day we were there the restaurant was fully booked. I can definitely see why! We were recommended the lunch prix fixe and were NOT disappointed. we both had the cauliflower &amp; blue cheese soup with was amazing! Croutons to die for! For the entree my husband had the Grilled  Portobello sandwich, he&apos;s a big meat eater but this mushroom burger he rated as one of his best meals in our 3 week USA trip! I had the ricotta and egg raviolo which was beautiful and fresh, the pork ragu that accompanied it was rich but divine! For dessert we both chose the salted caramel ice cream sundae which was amazing! Perfect serving size after 2 previous courses. The service we received was equally impressive. Very welcoming, friendly and </body>

        <body>After being recommended ABC Kitchen by friends our expectations were high and we were not disappointed. All the food was really good, served with fresh local grown vegetables frappe the nearby farmers market. The wine list was short but well composed. The service could have been more attentive but since it was a busy time in the restaurant we can let that one slip ...  We highly recommend it.</body>

        <body>Table ordered the Eggs Benedict, Scrambled Eggs and Oysters, Scrambled Eggs with fried potatoes, and a grilled chicken salad.  All the entrees were outstanding.  Appetizers included the crab toast and buttermilk cheddar muffins which were both over the top.   The only reason I did not give this 5 starts was that one of our entrees came out about 5 minutes later than the other 3.  Otherwise I found this to be an excellent brunch!</body>

        <body>I booked same day so shouldn&apos;t complain about the table we were given but ... I&apos;m going to! I had been looking forward to dining here during our visit to New York but with a crazy schedule it wasn&apos;t til the end of our trip we managed to fit it in. Obviously the last minute booking is NOT the thing to do as we were located out int a corridor like area - with several other tables but none of the ambience of the rest of the restaurant. As we walked in and through the place I was pleased with my choice - then they seated us in what seemed like an &apos;overflow&apos; area.  It was all &apos;fine&apos; but really disapointing given how lovely the rest of the restaurant looked / felt. The menu was interesting. My burger was great, but my partner struggled a bit as most options were vegetarian (and he didn&apos;t care for a buger). He was happy with his pasta when it was served though. The service was very friendly.</body>

        <body>ABC Kitchen is a trendy restaurant located in 18th str, just over Union Square. A great overall experience, great atmosphere and ambience, beautiful decoration, attentive service and delicious food. We visited it in a Sunday morning for brunch, so I can&apos;t speak for the whole menu - the brunch menu, however, was quite impressive (the buttermilk pancakes with lemon curd, they were absolutely delicious). And, as far as Sunday brunch is concerned, it was amazing that alhtough a trendy restaraunt, it attracts a lot of families, too! Totally recommended not only for the food but also for a great time out. Reservation is strongly advised, if you don&apos;t want to wait!</body>

        <body>Outstanding all around except it took some time to get our food. There were only 3 of us and the 2 diners sitting at the next table, who arrived after us, were served before us.  The waitress was apologetic and we know it wasn&apos;t her fault. Thankfully we were not in a hurry or it would have been an issue.</body>

        <body>I wish I had been able to get a dinner reservation but I am very happy with still being able to go on for Lunch. I was visiting from London and my sister from Sydney and this was the meal of the trip. The menu was simple yet the food exquisite. The Fluke was such a crisp flavour and the mushroom pizza was brought to the next level with the addition of the egg. This will be a recommendation for all friends visiting NYC.</body>

        <body>Totally recommend ABC Kitchen. Clean and cosy atmosphere, beautiful architecture. The service was good, the food amazing. I had the veggie burger and my expectations wasn&apos;t that high, but the burger was well seasoned and crunchy. The high light of the day, was the dessert. It is very difficult for me to say &quot;This is the best dish I ever had...&quot; but this was the best dessert I ever had in my life. I ordered the Sundae. Salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts &amp; popcorn, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. All the ingredients in perfect agreement.</body>

Our waiter was such a gem and so kind. The restaurant itself is also wonderfully decorated. It&apos;s right next to the abc store with beautiful furniture, jewelry, and clothing.  I definitely recommend this place. Friendly staff and wonderful food.</body>

        <body>This was a remarkable meal, one of the best I&apos;ve had. My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a Wednesday night (absolutely make a reservation). Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu and the wines, able to answer specific questions. This cannot be underestimated; a server who knows the menu this well contributes to an excellent experience.   We split one of their specials as an appetizer - house made linguine in a beer sauce with European white truffles shaved on top with a shaved cheese whose name I unfortunately can&apos;t remember. It lacked salt, which surprised me somewhat, but with the addition of a small amount of sea salt it was wonderful, and it was obvious that the pasta was fresh; it was eggy and delicious. It&apos;s also worth noting that the olive oil provided with the bread was excellent - very flavorful and a little peppery.   I ordered the pork confit, my boyfriend the black bass. I could wax poetic about both of these entrees - we literally had not one com</body>

        <body>This is the 3rd time I have gone to ABC for lunch.  Each time is better than the last!  The food is wonderful.  Always something new to taste with flavors that I would have never imagined going together bringing out the most delicious qualities of the meal.  Make reservations well in advance though.  WAlking in would be difficult.</body>

        <body>I went back to ABC kitchen knowing that I would have a great lunch as i previously did coyple of years ago there. I remember the food to be outstanding, unfortunately it is not anymore. The popular pizza was burnt and bland. The starter was salmon wi5h avocado but nothing special. The service was very slow (40 minutes between app and main dish) and the waitress haven&apos;t done any apologies. I won&apos;t be returning anytime soon.</body>

        <body>Went to Atwood before a play.  Wait staff&apos;s first question was whether we were on a schedule to make a show. He did all he could to ensure that we made the show on time.  That being said, there was no rush.  We enjoyed a leisurely dinner with friends.  Food, ambiance and service was great, I would have no concerns over dining there again.</body>

        <body>Our daughter and granddaughter ran the Shamrock Shuffle and we had brunch at the Atwood. We have breakfast/brunch there almost every Sunday because we attend church at the Chicago Temple down the street. It is always good, but Sunday was exceptional. Shawn and Kelly worked their magic to get a table for seven of us without a reservation (I had one for 1:30 but we wanted to eat at 11:00). Anthony gave us excellent service and the whole staff are pleasant and like our family. It was the first time our daughter had been there since the new renovation and she loved it. They don&apos;t really have a kids menu but they made just what our three grandchildren would eat.  Kudos go out to all the Atwood staff!! Love them PS: Hotel staff is great also</body>

        <body>I am a frequent guest at the Burnham Hotel, and very excited to see this new Atwood Restaurant.  It has been redone and very nicely!  The noise level is certainly energetic, but still cool to have a conversation.   Beyond the interior is the food and menu.  I do think that the menu, as before, still suffers from &quot;over&quot; elegant selections.  I WISH there were more &quot;reachable&quot; entrees that did not dive into the realm of unpronounceable.  The food was ok, and there are still some kinks here to work out, but I will be back.  The bar is amazing, and fun as it intertwines into the lobby.  Doesn&apos;t anyone have a cheeseburger or strip steak any more!!!  JUST too fancy for this type of space.</body>

        <body>We wanted to dine here because we were taking in a show that night and wanted to eat near the theatre. Service was prompt and friendly, glasses were never empty, and the shrimp and grits plate we started with was fantastic. I had the scallops, which were good, and my partner the crab fettuccine, which we both found to be over salted. My cocktail was great, but $14.95 for a Cape Cod is a bit pricey. Overall, fun place and would love to return as the ambience was fun and lively!</body>

        <body>If you are looking for consistently excellent food in lovely surroundings, the Atwood Cafe should be on your list.  The new decor is relaxingly elegant and the inclusion of a cozy bar area now makes this a great spot for an after theater drink.  Service is friendly and staff is attentive.</body>

        <body>Atwood has long been a favorite - I used to stay at the Burnham when in town on business, and since moving here, often meet friends there for Brunch or Lunch - and I missed it when they closed for renovations last year. But wow, what a transformation! The sleek white, chrome and glass design has brightened the dining room considerably, Happily, the menu is as good, if not better, than before. Specials are always that - really special - and the service is friendly, knowledgeable and, in my experience, wildly enthusiastic about the food. There&apos;s always something interesting on the menu, which offers enough variety (vegan, gluten free, vegetarian) to keep everybody happy!</body>

        <body>Atwood was a quiet and delicious choice for breakfast. They have a traditional eggs and bacon menu item (which my husband ordered) as well as more interesting options, such as the egg white frittata with goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and spinach that I ordered. Both were delicious. Service was excellent. It was quiet and relaxing and we were able to sit and sip our coffee while watching people on State Street.</body>

        <body>I ordered the steak which was the last plate to come out.  It was both tough and raw.  I sent it back and my fellow diners had almost finished and the replacement still hadn&apos;t arrived.  I had lost my appetite by then and told the waiter to cancel it.  I didn&apos;t want to eat my main course while everyone else either waited for me, or ate their dessert at the same time. This is not an inexpensive restaurant and has been a favorite of ours.  We come here for a special treat, and this was a real disappointment.  I left hungry and not sure if I want to risk revisiting the Atwood.</body>

        <body>We were going to a concert and my wife suggested Atwood cause they have a special parking rate as long as you dine there. My wife ordered a chicken special and I had another special that had scallops and shrimp . At first I wasn&apos;t concerned about the price, untill our dinners arrived. For $29.00 I expected more than 2 medium sized scallops and baby shrimp. Her meal was a good portion if you don&apos;t eat much. My meal had good favors, but it was like a childs portion. The parking was still $25.00 ( not much less than the parking garage&apos;s ) Now I remember why downtown Chicago is not were I want to go for concerts or any other shows. I feel sorry for anyone on a tight budget. I&apos;m not cheap, but what a ripoff. Give people a decent food portion and they will return. My wife would like to retire and move to a condo downtown. We both agreed you would have to keep working to do this.</body>

        <body>The room is awesome.  I like the bar area too.  Had the grilled romaine salad and added chicken.  One of the best salads I&apos;ve ever had!  Great service.  Highly recommended.</body>

        <body>I don&apos;t usually enjoy hotel restaurants so much, usually they are boxy and chainy, but Atwood is different. The menu is honestly nothing special and pretty limited, but the food is delicious. The service is over the top excellent. I was celebrating my birthday at Atwood and at the end of the meal was presented with a birthday card, signed by all the waitstaff. I mean, who does that? I am still taken aback by it, what an amazing gesture. And aside from this, our waiter was attentive and great the entire meal.</body>

        <body>We have been eating at the Atwood for 20 years and this was our first poor meal. My wife had chicken salad that was &quot;old&quot; and lettuce that had way too much dressing.  I had eggs Benedict and both eggs were hard boiled!!  We hope it returns to its better days.</body>

        <body>Food was good.  Restaurant was packed, though, so some parts of the meal took a bit longer than they might have if our server had a table or two less. However, my only criticism is that there are so many hard surfaces that the noise level is quite high.</body>

        <body>We ate at Atwood prior to seeing a show at Bank of America theater. The location was great for a pre-show dinner, even with only an hour-and-a-half to spend. The service was top notch, with a very knowledgeable and friendly waiter. The beer list was slightly under-whelming, considering the amount of great local options in Chicago. The wine and cocktail list, however, was much better. We got a couple small plates - the Midwest cheese plate was fantastic and the siracha-honey glazed chicken thighs were amazing. So was the mac and cheese. The only drawback to me is the place is a little crowded and loud. I would not recommend it for a romantic dinner. Great energy and fun vibe though.</body>

        <body>We were with a group of six for a pre-theatre dinner.   Everyone was complementary of their entree. Another diner and I had the trout, which we both agreed was terrific.   Service could have been better, but it did not detract from the overall experience.   Everyone in the group would return.  Prices were reasonable given the quality of the food.</body>

        <body>We have dined here before or after the theater several times and it is consistently excellent. The beautiful, deco ambiance adds a special treat to the evening. The service is usually prompt and always helpful and polite. This time, my brussels sprout appetizer was dry and fibrous, but my spare rib main course was tender, flavorful and well-proportioned.</body>

        <body>Compared to the former Atwood&apos;s (before the renovation), the menu is very limited and the choices are strange. It was hard to find anything to order.  The server was overbearing and kept coming back even though we told her we would let her know when we were ready to order.  She tried pushing us to order more things than we wanted.  I LOVED the old Atwood&apos;s but will probably not go back to this one.</body>

        <body>...located in the historically significant Burnham. Updates in appearance and food: More modern/less traditional. More approachable/less pretentious. I used to only recommend the former Atwood Cafe for dinners before a show in the Theater District but I may just return for more work lunches at the Atwood.</body>

        <body>We decided to go to Atwood because of its was a convenient before theater location.  We were surprised at how beautiful the restaurant is.  Lighting kept low so that it is pleasant place to relax and dine unhurriedly.  We asked server for recommendations and she helped us pair a large plate with an appetizer and said it would be plenty for two for dinner.  She was right. We were completely satisfied.  We headed off to the theater without feeling stuffed.   We&apos;ll return again with friends so we can try more items from the menu</body>

        <body>Atwood has gone through a major interior renovation. The quality and service is what one has come to expect when dining there. They did cover up the huge, beautiful windows which I wish they hadn&apos;t. The view of the bustling State and Washington Street corners always added a nice dimension to the restaurant.</body>

        <body> Went to Atwood for brunch.  Their signature Atwood Omelet and their Quiche, the flavor ingredient in both is bacon.  Waiter said the establishment had no bacon.  So only ordered a (dried -out)  English muffin.   Friend&apos;s corned beef hash was cubed, gristle, like, spam which they replaced with rock-hard burger.</body>

        <body>Noisy, rushed service, mediocre food, and expensive - what more can one ask for?  We had 6 appetizers and 4 drinks and the bill was $15O.  The charcuterie was OK,  and the  sweetbreads and sliders were  good; but the kAle/asparagus soup very bitter, deviled eggs were not eatable, lamb meatballs boring .    We have been customers for years but may never return.  Plus, the only reason I checked anything  from the recommend list is the review would not accept until I did so.</body>

Both the hostess and our waiter Heath were knowledgeable about the new menu and genuinely engaging.  Be sure to try the raspberry basil sorbet.</body>

        <body>We went for Saturday brunch. They&apos;ve redone the space - I preferred the Old Art Deco look - this is more modern looking - still nice but has lost a bit of its charm IMO. But overall is pretty nice. Menu has changed slightly - the lamb cheeseteak was quite excellent.  I assume they are still finding their feet - will give them some time to adjust.</body>

        <body>Atwood was a terrific restaurant in the Loop for many years -- excellent food in a lovely setting.  I looked forward to getting back to it, but will certainly not return.  The food was terrible.  I asked for a beer on draught -- it kicked just before I asked for it -- so I chose a bottle on the menu, which came unchilled.  The fish was barely edible -- incredibly salty and tough.  The only upside was the service, which was superb  Perhaps one day the food will match the service.</body>

        <body>The new Atwood is airy,light,beautiful .The staff is great from the host to the busser and knowledgeable and attentive server.I appreciate that there&apos;s a children&apos;s menu,would be nice if there was something else for them.( crayons, puzzle etc)  What really needs work is the menu,lyonnaise and Rissotto special we&apos;re less than flavorful,the chocolate cake was overbaked,the price point us very expensive for the portion and quality.great wine list..I live in neighborhood and would be nice to be able to go to a nice place like the Atwood without spending $50 a head for lunch,although service and room are great the food needs to be worth that.</body>

        <body>We have always loved Atwood for its cozy feel and historic, &quot;old Chicago&quot; ambience. We enjoyed going there with work associates to have a quiet, relaxed place to talk about professional issues over a special bottle of wine and a creative menu. The wines and creative dishes are still on ththe menu, but the scene and ambience has completely changed. It is now like many trendy restaurants with a more severe, monchromatic, cool color &quot;open&quot; decor and a very loud dining room. Not that I do not like restaurants in this style, I do, but this is not what we had in mind for,the evening.  Frankly, I was sorry to see the change as I my colleagues and I really appreciated the warmer, cozier, quieter Atwood.</body>

        <body>The recent renovation of Atwood is terrific!  The food and service has always been fantastic but the new decor has elevated the Atwood dining experience exponentially.  The room now feels open, light and so very comfortable.  Refreshingly the menu is not extensive but amazingly there is something delicious for everyone!</body>

        <body>The décor is very nice.  The food was good, but pricey compared to most other places, and the service was adequate.  We would not go out of our way to go there again.  We expected more.</body>

        <body>The &quot;new&quot; menu appeals to a microcosm of diners with limited selections, uninspired presentation, pitiful portions and elevated prices.  Four blobs of undercooked biscuit dough masquerading as &quot;savory monkey bread&quot;launched a meal that continued to disappoint throughout.</body>

        <body>The grandbaby had some issues and needed extra attention.  the staff at the hotel invited son and daughter in law to use a room to care for the baby.  Very much appreciated, very considerate. One more reason to return to Atwood</body>

        <body>I loved the Atwood Cafe. I brought my daughter and grand-daughter there and they loved the unique decorating style. WE planned to make it part of our Christmas tradition.  It reminded me of McKenzie Child. Apparently the powers that be decided to re-decorate and now it is all white and chrome and very modern and I absolutely hated it. I will probably never go back there again. It was a huge disappointment to me.</body>

        <body>The food was very good. The drinks were better. Maybe because we went at noon on a Sunday, instead of the evening... but I felt like we were having breakfast with 100 close friends in someone&apos;s kitchen. The service was just ok.   I enjoyed the grilled romaine salad. My husband was happy with the smoked salmon plate. We both loved the Pressed Scotsman cocktail. And I do like their wine list.  But the atmosphere... the restaurant is now part of the lobby/front desk — all open. The bar is bigger, which they needed. But it looks like a kitchen: stark white, lots of molding, ceiling to the sky with lots of pendant lighting. The giant windows are great (people watching!), but the seating is crunched and on top of each other and the place is crazy loud. Nothing like the comfy, throwback atmosphere of the old Atwood. I may give it one more chance for the food and drink, in hopes that a nighttime visit will alleviate the starkness of the place. I&apos;m really afraid the noisiness will send me home</body>

        <body>Am friend and I enjoyed an after-theatre meal at Atwood. The new menu, though fairly small, has ample choices. Our server was helpful, friendly, gracious and added to a very pleasant experience. We&apos;ll be back! The redesign of the space is beautiful... modern and yet a perfect complement to the building&apos;s heritage and the Burnham details.</body>

        <body>I was curious about the remodel. I found the same excellent customer service by all the staff, the same lovely menu (love their natural juices and the food stayed the same thankfully). Ambiance: up to standards of nice modern hotel based restaurants. Very modern look, very chic marble top tables, nice modern feel to the place. I miss the vintage artsy look and the cozy fireplace at the entrance but understand that hotels need to keep up with the times and overall they did a great job! Always what stands out here is the excellent staff.</body>

        <body>Was delighted by the &quot;new&quot; Atwood!  As we attend Goodman Theatre, we have frequently eaten at Atwood Cafe.  While I was always charmed by the quirky blue glasses, sofas, and colors everywhere, I was even more pleased with the new look: clean, uncluttered, and modern, which compliments the outstanding architecture of the building. The food was excellent, as always, and the new bar and creative new cocktails made me wish we had more time to explore this &quot;new&quot; Atwood.</body>

        <body>Service pre-show was excellent. Favorite food items were the cheese board- some select cheeses were particularly good and I am rarely impressed by a cheese board. Thanks to our server who wrote down all the cheeses so we could source on our own. Scallops and shrimp entree was also perfect.</body>

        <body>Two members of our party we shocked at the spicy fettucini.  It was not clear on the menu  to expect it, and had it been, another selection would have been made.  With that said, the food was delicious.  Especially the pork belly BLTs.    Would certainly dine here again.</body>

        <body>On the corner of Washington &amp; State, in the Burnham Hotel, is Atwood, a neighborhood gem and perfect for crowd-watxhubg, theatre &amp; opera fans, and their level of service from a dedicated staff hasn&apos;t failed me in over 5 years of dining there! The room is a fantastic &amp; vibrant mix of baroque and classic, the eggs Benedict combos are all delish, its a must-visit regardless if whether ur staying at the Kimpton or not!</body>

        <body>My wife and I spent a weekend in Chicago and made a reservation at Atwood for Saturday night. The small plates menu is excellent. Our waiter Adam made great suggestion after great suggestion.  The entire staff was very attentive. The maitre d noticed I was uncomfortable in the wooden chair and brought me a leather seat which was much better.  Definitely recommended!</body>

        <body>Absolutely love the new renovation of the bar and restaurant. The restaurant is more open with many more seats (no longer stuffy)  and added an actual full size bar compared to the previous bar in the corner.  Updated finishes that are very pleasing, the new drapery and lights open up the historic windows and the space shines at night. Only bar open late at night. Don&apos;t listen to the old reviewers here, I can&apos;t believe they liked the old atwood layout and outdated scene. The food is fit for another review but bottom line, farm to table french wonderful</body>

        <body>I miss the old Atwood where the food was amazing! Great dishes like the sausage with cheesy potatoes on the side (not sure what the actual name is) &amp; French toast with fruit were replaced by pretentious dishes that lack in flavor. I do like the decor ... because it matches my kitchen ... I guess that is was they were going for ... but the place that was our favorite brunch spot and only a few blocks from our apartment is not our favorite place anymore :(</body>

        <body>This was the best meal I have ever had in Las Vegas, exceptional food and service, with a price to match.  The steak was incredibly flavorful, as were the pasta dishes and appetizers.  The service was attentive and outstanding.   Carnevino is very, very expensive but worth it.</body>

        <body>Ricotta ravioli in brown butter sauce with Parmesan is superb. Try not to love it too much cause you will only get one! Grilled octopus is special too. Porterhouse steak for two is 90 days dry aged, cooked to perfection with outer crust and medium rare inside. Drizzled with olive oil too!  Waiter will advise you that cooking temperatures are a bit rarer than normal and this is correct. Many steak choices on the menu.   Awesome food. Best steak in Vegas, cooked and enjoyed the way steak ought to be.</body>

        <body>Upon entering the restaurant to be seated, our party of 4 was reminded that our reservation was very early, around 5:30 pm.  We thought this would be good, because at the time there were very few people already there and the noise level would be low to foster good conversation.  We were seated, however, directly next to a very loud speaker, which, at high volume, made conversation near impossible.  We immediately asked if we could be moved, or if the audio could be turned down, and were assured it would be lowered in volume.  We were assured of this three more times over the next 20 minutes.  It never happened and effectively became the ONE key memory of the evening.  Why could the volume not be turned down? We don&apos;t know although we were informed &quot;management&quot; was &quot;looking into it&quot;.    So although the Food was wonderful, the service was dismissive, and the experience undeserving of a repeat or recommendation.</body>

        <body>Wow, really looked forward to this dining experience and we were appalled at the quality of the food and service. Took 40 minutes after seating to see our waiter. Ordered a $ 200 bottle of wine  from the sommelier and she made us feel we were on the cheap-- granted some of the wines are several thousand.  We did not see her again after the initial wine pour. Steak over cooked and under seasoned . Duck over cooked , veal scallopini just ok . Dessert was good but this is the only good thing I can say about this place,  especially for the price.</body>

        <body>I had read several great reviews of Carnevino and was anxious to enjoy a wonderful evening.  The restaurant setting was very nice and the service was very good.  Everything was going well until our meal arrived.  I ordered the New York Strip, and was thoroughly disappointed.  The steak was seared such that it was difficult to cut with the steak knife.  I ordered the steak to be cooked &quot;medium&quot;.  In addition to not be able to cut the steak, the flavor was nothing special.  I have had much better steak at half the cost.  The other members of my dinner part were also &quot;unimpressed&quot; with their steak, stating that it was &quot;just OK&quot;.  Considering the cost, the food was unimpressive.</body>

        <body>Food and service memorable but likely over 200 wines on the list but very little (maybe half a dozen) under and just under $100. We don&apos;t get cheap on wine but the list could have had some more reasonable selections.  Obviously priced for Vegas High Rollers.</body>

        <body>We were aware of the price before making our reservation. I had been there before and had a good meal. We were seated right next to the server station and there was traffic all thru the meal. Seemed like a bunch of kids that just wanted to stand around and look like they had no idea what they were supposed to do.  Our steak was really expensive, again was expected, but the little chunks of meat we got from... I could have bought a 1/4 cow for that price. And my piece was so gristly I left more scraps on my plate than eat. Our Brussels were way under cooked, and the potatoes, barely enough for one person and this was a two person plate.    Our waiter was snobbish, He did not like the fact that we did not order drinks. He was condescending the rest of the meal.   Not worth the time or Money. Go somewhere else.</body>

        <body>The calamari appetizer (flash fried in rice flour...so gluten free for my colleague) was delicious, albeit a bit smaller than expected for the price (even for Vegas prices).  My chopped salad and my colleague&apos;s tonnarelli pasta second courses were both delicious, and actually a bit larger than expected.  We both had the New York Strip for our main.  The Strip is bone-in, although it doesn&apos;t say this on the menu.  This was my biggest disappointment.  I love New York Strip, and considering the bone-in cut and the extended aging process (which they brag about as soon as the wait staff reaches the table), I didn&apos;t find the meat (cooked medium rare) nearly as flavorful as I would have aniticpated.  I also didn&apos;t find it as well seasoned as I would expect.  The steak wasn&apos;t bad, it just wasn&apos;t what I had hoped for.  My colleague enjoyed his steak (cooked medium) more than I did, so maybe it was just luck of the draw.  If I only had the steak, I probably would have given this a 3-star review</body>

        <body>Such simple foods &amp; preparations turn out as pure GENIOUS on the plate - WOW! My husband has never had lamb chops cooked as perfectly as these - grilling and serving them with the &quot;fat cap&quot; on was a first and boy, what flavor.  Extraordinarily juicy - albeit messy :) don&apos;t miss the pasta with eggplant, ricotta, basil and mint! Mint purée in the pasta dough -  who thinks of that?! And what about panna cotta topped with fresh rhubarb compote with a shortbread cookie, yessir!  Perfect service by entire team.</body>

        <body>Very disappointed with menu. I made this reservation months ago and was not informed of the limited choices available. Very high priced for the offering. I Would NOT recommend for a holiday to anyone</body>

        <body>Great experience for group dining - the prices may scare some, but you get exactly what you pay for...excellent service, knowledgeable staff, outstanding wine selection, and the food was unbeatable. The lamb was cooked perfectly and multiple people in our party of 12 raved about the chateaubriand steak.  The octopus appetizer was surprisingly tender and was a hit with all.  Most notable was the coordinated and timely staff - all of our main courses arrived at the same time and were literally served almost simultaneously!!!  Great experience for all with no complaints...would definitely recommend and will return to enjoy again!</body>

        <body>I scheduled  a dinner for 6 to celebrate a special occasion. Everything was good, but the food is very expensive. For what we got, I felt that it was overpriced. Great wine list. I had a better steak for less the following night at another restaurant. Service was very good.</body>

        <body>We live in LV and have wanted to visit Carnevino for quite some time, but just never made it.  We went on Monday prior to a show that we were seeing in the Venetian.  My husband had the octopus appetizer and the bone in pork chop....both excellent.  I had the beet carpaccio salad and filet...again both excellent.  In addition, the service was very attentive, but not too much.  Everyone was very friendly.  Since we ate really early at 5:15 pm and on a Monday night it was very quiet, but picked up quickly.  Highly recommend for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>I booked a resevation here for lunch since I waited too long to place a dinner reservation. But that was ok because I had the restaurant to myself The wait staff did a tremendous job in the service and satisfaction they brought knowledge to me about the food and the process it intails. Hats off to the guys and gals thank you for a great service I was very pleased.The reastaurant ambiance was very cool and classy! Great design and elegant. The food was one of the best dining experiences of my life, the flavors and the richness are to die for (YUMMY) Great job Chefs!  Maybe Mario himself was in the kitchen haha,,,The wine was also very delishious, Very nice selection of wine and spirits. I would highly recommend and would love to go again. Next time I will plan in advance for a dinner reservation . I heard the place is hopping in the evening.</body>

        <body>It truly was an unforgettable experience.  The service was exceptional as was the food.  The steaks  were fantastic and absolutely perfect on the rare side as they should be.  Ambiance was awesome only two small negs....it was indeed loud but that was expected and the doggy bag returned to us was minus the meat just bones as we found out the next day....so that was disappointing for the day after.   However I am sure that was unintentional......Just a spectacular place to have dinner and we will recommend it very highly.</body>

        <body>CarneVino presents itself as a high-end restaurant thus we expected a phenomenal meal.  Although the meal was good, I wouldn&apos;t consider it great.  The service, however, was wonderful. The meat portions are BIG (easily sharable), and everything is ala carte so it&apos;s pricey to get a full meal.  We ordered:  2 salads - HUGE &amp; mediocre; beef cheek ravioli - presented as one of his &quot;specialties&quot; but it was just &quot;ok&quot;; bone-in pork chop - outside flavor was amazing but inside meat was tough &amp; bland.  We had a nice dinner but I won&apos;t rush to go back.</body>

        <body>I feel that this place is a bargain for being so nice inside with great service on this strip. I do order small items and stay away from the pricer ones like steak for two. I like the spaghetti ai Frutti de mare. It has amazing little octopus&apos;s in it which are very tender and delicious. For some reason both times I have had this dish the shrimp was way overdone. We also like the tuscan seafood stew with great broth for dipping bread into. The quality of the ingredients used is the very best. They also have a great selection of wine by the glass. I enjoyed the Brunello Di Montalcino by the glass so much that I ordered a second glass.</body>

        <body>Amazing, fabulous food and wine list, and very nice decor.... BUT I could not understand why they had Jamaican Reggae music playing at a fairly loud level.  It could not have been more strange or inappropriate to the point where it was disturbing.  I asked the waiter why and his only response was &quot;it&apos;s been that way for a long time&quot;.  NEEDS TO CHANGE - bring the review down from a 5 to a 4 overall - and there LOTS of choices in Vegas</body>

        <body>Went in for lunch and had the place to ourselves...literally. The server tried hard, seemed very knowledgable, but sometimes that can come of the wrong way...it did a little here. The service was spotty though - seems strange, but she didn&apos;t stand there waiting to see if we needed anything and without other customers to faorce her to happen by, she was either not there, or right on us, never nearby to be flagged down for anoher drink or a condiment, etc.  This is all fairly understandable given the DEAD nature of the place. But the food, REALLY?! We fully expected a bolognese that would blow our minds. At a place called Carnevino, you do not expect a plate of mostly pasta with less than an ounce of meat, even as a lunch portion. Could not have been more disappointed with the bolognese. Some of these chefs seem to be cashing in on their name and are either unable or unwilling to control quality to a standard which would be expected. Want some great foodie food with a celebrity chef nam</body>

        <body>There are plenty of  great steaks in Vegas - but I would put Carne Vino at the top of places you  should visit.  It is consistently among my favorite stops when I am in town. The wine list is unbelievable - if you love Italian Wines, there isn&apos;t a more comprehensive list, but the rest of the list is just as impressive. The service is always professional and knowledgeable.   In addition to the steak - the pasta choices are delicious, and when truffles are in season, they are very generous with the shavings on top of your favorite.   I highly recommend this restaurant. For business or pleasure.</body>

        <body>We were disappointed that there was no halibut.  I find it admirable when a restaurant is toting sustainable menu.  My husband was excited about the halibut that was on both menu of open table.  To find out that halibut hasn&apos;t been available for months.  It might behoove them to update their menu occasionally.  Our waiter tried to suggest other entrees, but none lived up to our expectations.   The use of bacon is very prominent throughout.</body>

        <body>If you are looking for 90 day aged beef, this is your place! The five of us split a porterhouse &amp; a rib eye. We wanted to be able to compare them. Both were excellent &amp; would recommend them, half liked one other the other. Sides were excellent and service was good, our waiter, Shepard was great. Bar service was a but slow but worth the wait. Highly recommend.</body>

        <body>Needless to say I left very disappointed. We had made our reservations almost 30 days in advance, when we got to the restaurant 15 minutes early to check in we were informed that they were running a little behind but should get us seated by the time our reservation time. After 3 different check in&apos;s and 30 minutes past my reservation time we were finally seated. When we walked in we saw 4 different tables that were ready for people to be seated at, with full table settings. Our table did not have a table cloth (read bare top table) with place settings. There were a total of 3 tables without table clothes and the rest had them. My assumption was they brought out more tables to seat people and either over booked for the night or calculated wrong. It was Super Bowl weekend, but I have done this trip for 15 years now and this is the first time I have run into this. Our server was polite, but it take take longer than a normal time to get us our drinks or to place our food order. Refills of</body>

        <body>First impression was positive.  The restaurant looked cool and our waiter was very knowledgeable and cocktails were some of the best ever (Bokers Manhattan and Negroni).  Our appetizer and pasta course arrived at the same time and before the sommelier arrived at our table (waiter forget to tell her we needed wine).  They quickly sent out wine, which was much lighter bodied than we asked for but just went with it.  Steaks came out when we were eating our app and pasta so waiter sent them back to the kitchen.  Steaks were re-delivered and our waiter went MIA afterwards and we were passed off to some other guy who was not a full on waiter (assistant waiter?).  Steak was under seasoned; needed some salt!  We left without dessert or coffee since our waiter had moved on to other tables and the music was bad.  We and another table asked the restaurant to change the music but were told it was Mario&apos;s Mix and could not be changed.  Mario should stick to what he knows best: cooking, not playing</body>

        <body>Cannot say enough about this place!   Had no idea what to expect at an &quot;Italian&quot; Steakhouse, let me tell you, it was the most amazing meal I&apos;ve ever had!   Following a traditional Italian meal, with antipasto first, light pasta course second, and steak/meat course third, everything we had was just amazingly prepared and excellent.   We had the beef raviolis on the advice of our server, which were to die for.   The steak and lobster tail were excellent.  Have never had lobster tail cooked that way before, so full of flavor, everything just melted in your mouth.   Impressive service, overall, one of the best restaurants I&apos;ve ever been to.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</body>

I had the New York steak, dry aged tortellini, and Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were great. Steak was nothing special and tortellini was not tasty at all.</body>

Incredible unique flavor and richness like nothing I have had before. I highly recommend and will certainly be back.</body>

        <body>This was a great meal and experience.  Try to eat in the wine room.  The ambiance is much better than the large dining room.    For reference, I have traveled extensively in Italy and know good food.  The food was beyond our expectations.  The steak tartare is a must.  It was simply the best I have ever eaten.  The beef cheek stuffed ravioli was homemade and very good.  We shared both of these appetizers as we wanted to leave room for the star of the meal -- the 90 day dry aged steak Fiorentina.  Three fingers thick, just like in Florence, we had the steak rare, charred on the outside.  Even my wife, who is not a big steak fan, ate every bite.  I cannot emphasize how good this steak was.  Off the chart comes to mind.  We did get a few sides but I never ate them because I wanted to finish the steak.  While the wine list was overwhelming and pricey, our able waiter helped me find a very nice wine which didn&apos;t break the bank.    I&apos;m going back to Las Vegas next month on business and will</body>

        <body>We were given a table in their back room, so quite a walk from the hostess stand.  This in addition to the walk from the parking garage being quite long.  This room had no windows and not much decor to make you feel happy.  Guessing it was supposed to look like an Italian wine cellar?  The main waiter was good, but the auxiliary help did not speak loud enough or make sure we could understand what they were saying.  Someone brought us something wrapped in a napkin compliments of the chef.  I thought she said it was cheese.  Turned out to be a round bread thing.  My hangar steak was cold when received and the waiter took it back and probably put it under a heat lamp for a moment.  The underside was still cold.  We appreciated a side dish selection that was different from most restaurants.  Flavor of food was pretty good, but not sure we would bother to return, considering how many choices are in Las Vegas.</body>

        <body>Seating was in the dining area across from the main bar area of the restaurant, which we did not particularly like.  Asked for a booth on the reservation; none existed except in the bar area and no one asked if we would like to sit in that particular area.  When seated we were immediately waited on by a very exuberant server who was able to communicate our special dietary restrictions to the chef.  The food was good overall; service good.  The prices were a bit on the high side, particularly where wines by the glass were concerned, but it is Las Vegas.  The wine list was extensive in terms of bottles, not so much for wines by the glass.  Menu is strongly focused on steak and most of the pasta dishes seemed quite heavy in terms of sauces used.  If you need something light be sure to ask for marinara sauce.</body>

        <body>Our table got the dry aged, bone-in ribeye. Unbelievable; they bring it out and slice it for you as it is meant fork two.  The roasted beats side was perfect with it.  Did not get wine as there was just not a reasonable option.  The list is amazing though but no two digit prices.</body>

        <body>Was worried about our attire but casual is ok for this fine dining restaurant. The staff is on top of everything and very knowledgable. Cesar was our server and he was the best server I have ever had at any restaurant. The food was amazing!  I had the game hen with apple reduction. It was everything I hoped. My husband had the dry aged steak. We definitely know now why they are know for their steaks. My water glass was never empty and never hS to be asked to refill.  Cesar recommend my new favorite wine. Dessert was just divine. Best expresso. Overall, I would say 10 star service with 5 star food.</body>

        <body>Mario Batali has created a wonderful restaurant in Vegas. He has a great menu and lots of choices for all meat lovers. My only complaint would be the extremely overpriced wine list, which although is on trend for the area doesn&apos;t make it right. When even your house by the glass is $20+ and the only decent Chardonnay is $66 (For A Glass) there is something wrong.  So I love the Carne, but the Vino is too snobby even for this wine snob. It was a good experience, but I doubt I would ever go back.</body>

        <body>Found CarneVino after being unable to book other Vegas steakhouses at a reasonable dinner time. Located in the Palazzo, getting there from the Strip allows a pleasant walk through the Venetian and Palazzo casinos. The service is fantastic -- very attentive, knowledgeable and professional without coming across as snooty. A small army cared for us throughout dinner with perfect coordinate and timing -- nobody in our group of 7 ever waited for anything, yet it did not feel intrusive.   The prosciutto riserva and beef tartare were phenomenal. I felt the grilled octopus was very good, while others in our party found it outstanding. Chef Batali&apos;s &quot;off menu&quot; beef cheek ravioli is not to be missed, and the gnocchi was good as well. The star of the show, however, was the dry-aged ribeye for 2 -- a gargantuan cut served on the bone and sliced table side. Cooked to perfection with an amazing rich, almost sweet, flavor, with the bone provided to get every last bite. The mixed mushroom, mashed pot</body>

        <body>Carnevino is known for their Dry Aged steaks.  My group ordered the Porterhouse and Ribeye.  I can say that I have eaten at ALL of the top steakhouses in Vegas and these steaks were a cut above all of them.  They truly were the best steaks I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure of eating!</body>

        <body>The service was excellent and all our other food was great (steak tartare, pasta, salads). But the steak dinner was terrible. We ordered the 90 day dry aged porterhouse. Which is one of their most expensive steaks. It was very disappointing. The meat was not tender and cooked improperly. This is the first time I have ever written a review of a restaurant, but the steak was so bad that I felt compelled to type this.</body>

        <body>Spent the weekend in Vegas, with it culminating here at CarneVino. The service was great, the atmosphere was great, that is, until they began blasting loud music. Totally killed the ambiance they created. Aside from that, the food was amazing. What I did not like however was their insistence that their menu is to be &quot;enjoyed&quot; in a 3-course meal setting. The menu isnt structured well enough to show that, so i felt that was somewhat disingenuous of them to say. I have been to italy and have enjoyed the proper italian meal, so i am familiar with the customs of eating at an italian establishment, but it felt too forced here. Otherwise, everything was really nice. Felt it was over priced, but so is everything else in Vegas, so i cannot fault them for that.</body>

        <body>We were going to the Palazzo Theatre for a show and wanted to eat somewhere close.  Carnevino was a great find on Open Table.  Our server, Carlos, was fantastic.  He explained about all the dishes, especially the steak.  We ordered the aged beef for two.  It melts in your mouth and is well worth the price!</body>

        <body>My wife and I showed up for our 7:30 reservation this past Saturday around 7:25.  We were told they were a little busy and it would be a few minutes after our reservation time before we were seated.  Hey, it&apos;s a busy Super Bowl weekend in Vegas, so a little bit of a wait was not a problem.  We waited until about 8:00 before we walked out without ever trying the food.  Here is why we walked out.  During the 30 minutes we sat there, no fewer than 3 two tops and 3 four/five tops who arrived after us were seated.  I spoke to one of the hostesses regarding the situation and was told that they have only sat 2 big parties in the last 20 or so minutes.  Unfortunately, that was not true.  I told myself I would give them a few more minutes to make it right.  The breaking point was when a party of two gentlemen walked up to the hostess desk at 8:00 to check-in for their 8:00 reservation.  The hostess grabbed two menus and immediately took them to the dining room.  My wife and I got up and walked</body>

        <body>My customers and I ordered steaks.  I must say the service, appetizers and side dishes were great!  We must have caught them on a bad night because our steaks were almost uneatable.  One of my customers cut of a large pile of gristle off from his steak.  Once again, we must have been there on a bad night.  I was very disappointed and had to apologize to my customers.</body>

        <body>CarneVino has been one of my favorite restaurants in the city since it&apos;s opened.  I recommend the restaurant ALL THE TIME!  I love the easy access/entrance from Palazzo.  I love the feel of the restaurant.  It&apos;s prices are not for the weak of heart so you expect great service and a great meal.  Each time (literally every time) I&apos;ve gone to CarneVino I am challenged at the hostess stand.  Once I&apos;m inside and dealing with my server it&apos;s great.  This time was no different.  The hostess staff is not up to par with the restaurant.  We had a simple table request - move over one table - literally.  Yes we know it may have meant it was changing servers tables - and we get that.  Regardless, the answer should have been of course. It was instead, heaving of sighs, rolling of eyes and no for an answer.  You feel &apos;put out&apos; by asking them a question.  You feel you are a bother to them.  All four in our party experienced it at different times in the night.  Our server was delightful, knowledgeable </body>

        <body>I went to Carnevino with 2 friends as a &quot;we&apos;re in Vegas, let&apos;s go to one of the big-named restaurants&quot; kind of occasion.  It did not disappoint.  The service was spectacular, which is amazing since one of our 3 was 30 minutes late due to his wife losing her phone (he successfully recovered it).  The appetizers were spectacular, the side dishes were amazing, (as many people mention) the bread and the lard was phenomenal, and then the rib eye steak for 2.  I&apos;ve never had a steak as well prepared.  I have had a better quality steak - Kobe beef flown in from Japan - but never have I had a bone-in rib eye this well prepared.  Every phase of this meal was top-notch.  In addition, my buddy would never forgive me if I didn&apos;t mention that he had the best Old Fashioned cocktail he&apos;s ever had.  Bottom line, I&apos;m sure on occasion that every restaurant has its off days, but the ceiling for how good an experience can be at Carnevino is higher than any place I&apos;ve ever been.  Highly recommended for an</body>

        <body>I waited fr a long time to dine here and the actual dining experience was more than I ever could have imagined!  I would like to start with the service.  From the time we walked in, until the time we left, the staff could not have done more to make our time enjoyable!  Being a person who requires a gluten free diet due to medical reasons, the staff was on top of it from the very beginning.  That is very much appreciated!  The food...what can I say.......IT WAS THE BEST MEAL I HAVE EVER EATEN!  I have dined all over the world and am pleased to give this honor to Carne Vino.  From the wine to dinner all of the way to dessert was OUTSTANDING!  Thank you to all who made this meal so memorable!</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve dined here several times and enjoyed the beef tasting menu, this time it seemed the food was a little less inspired-I had beef cheek ravioli and my husband had a Flinstones-style rib eye-both were good but something was missing. The service was adequate but also a little lackluster. Strongly suggest stocking some wine for the &quot;commoners&quot; who aren&apos;t able to spent hundreds of dollars for a bottle to enjoy with their meal. Overall good, not great this time.</body>

        <body>Evening started out good. Server had no personality but was at least efficient. Ravilolo app was decent. Then everything went south. Our server got a twelve top and we basically never saw him again. Had to flag down another server twice for more wine. This is with at least five manager-types wandering around doing nothing except looking confused. It should have been glaringly obvious that our server was blown out and needed help. I will give props to Marcella (sp?), our back waiter, for being the only person in the restaurant that seemed to care. When our server finally got around to bringing us our credit card slip he just set it down and mumbled &quot;thanks&quot; as he was running off.  And the dry-aged steaks? Well, they got the dry part right. As in, no moisture at all. And we ordered them medium rare. But, the place was packed, they got our $400, so what do they care? We didn&apos;t bother to say anything to mgmt because I highly doubt it would have mattered to them. The hosts didn&apos;t even say </body>

        <body>Vegas has a lot of great places to eat, this was one of the best meals I&apos;ve had in a long time.  From the Prosciutto di Parma &apos;Riserva&apos; to the white truffle pasta, to the Filet with Foie Gras and white truffles shaved on top.  Everything rocked.  Highly recommend!!</body>

        <body>Your beef was terrible. No way it was 90 day dry aged. It had zero age flavor nor did it look like it had any shrinkage. We felt completely ripped off!  Worst of all it was &quot;select&quot; at best. Zero marbling! You should be ashamed.</body>

        <body>Our experience at Carne Vino was divine. We went along with the waiter&apos;s recommendation:  1.-Grilled Octopus  2.-Beef cheek raviolis 3.-Dried Aged Bone in Rib Eye for 2. For sides (not come with steak, you have to pay extra) We got grilled mushrooms and smash potatoes with runny egg yolk on top...just wow. Honestly...we were sooo stuffed by the end of our meal so maybe we should have ordered just one side? But If I were to go back, I would have ordered the same thing all over again! This was trully a great meal. It comes on the pricey side though, our bill with tip and drinks got to 350 for 2. But  I dont regret spending all that money. Also, we got a noisey table sitting right next to us but thats expected in vegas and not really the restaurant&apos;s fault.</body>

        <body>We visit Vegas every year and have dined at CarneVino the last two.  This time we were disappointed.  The temperature of our food wasn&apos;t what it should have been and the lamb chops were terrible.  Before I tell you what we had for dinner, let me say that there were 6 of us, all adults.   We began our meal with arugula salad (delicious), escarole salad (meh), and the big-eye tuna appetizer( superb).  Next, we had lamb chops, NY Strip, and the grilled pork chop.  The lamb chops were really about 80% fat, the steak was ok, and the pork chop was fantastic.  When I brought the overly-fatty lamb chops to the attention of our waiter, his comment, while not exactly rude, bordered on patronizing and was definitely dismissive.  I&apos;m no dummy, therefore I understand the necessity for a certain amount of fat, but really?  $63 for about $8 worth of actual meat.  My husband&apos;s slice alone was about 90% fat.  If I were the chef, I would not let that plate leave my kitchen.  They had a chance to amend </body>

        <body>Apart from the excellent steamed clam appetizer, a very mediocre meal, considering the hype. My vegan wife found her dishes overly rich, and not creative, ordinary. My New York steak, aged 90 days, had an interesting flavour, but that&apos;s about all. It was small, not tender and on the bone which I was not advised of. It was as if the bone was left on to hold the shape to an acceptable size. Maybe Mario Batali should be there more than once every three or four months to oversee the place.</body>

The waiters and the counter did not really asked for water or drinks and  did not tell us any thing until they holded us and the poeple who did not made the reservation  got their seats first.The portions and food wasn&apos;t as great as before. :(</body>

        <body>We ate at Ramsey Steak last year and loved it so thought we would try another restaurant with a tv host(Masterchef-Joe Bastianich).  We were very disappointed with the quality of the food as well as some of the portion sizes of side dishes-2 mouthfuls.  Steaks were also asked to be cooked medium and they were basically raw.  Will not be returning.</body>

        <body>It&apos;s pricey, but it&apos;s an experience that you will not forget.   Amazing service and the food exceeded any expectations that we had walking in. Our party of 7 tried about half of the appetizers, half the dinner sides and the most popular steaks including the bone in ribeye - which is a must have if 2 people will enjoy an amazing steak, carved tableside. The desserts did not disappoint either, the tiramisu is one of the best I&apos;ve had in the city. Check was $1700 with the tip - and worth every penny.</body>

        <body>Very good food, the ribeye was great. My only complaint was that it was a lot to eat, even for two.</body>

        <body>Certain images may come to mind when hearing the term &quot;steakhouse.&quot; Very few would apply here, and that is a good thing. The decor and ambiance is more of a high end fine dining establishment with quality linen and serving ware. Thus the first impression sets the tone.  Chef Nicole and her staff have paid attention  to every step in the preparation and presentation of the dry aged bone-in rib eye. The table presentation of the sides and the steak itself only adds to the atmosphere of a very special dining experience.  Not only was the quality of the meal superb (locally grown/sourced fresh asparagus is not to be missed) but the portions were very abundant. Everyone deserves to dine here when in Las Vegas.</body>

        <body>Dinner here was absolutely wonderful!  We ordered the grilled octopus appetizer and it was divine!  I highly recommend it.  Our server recommended the moscato because we wanted something sweet.  The moscato was so fragrant and delicious!  We ordered the bone in ribeye for two.  It was very filling and delicious!  The service was amazing and we can&apos;t wait to go back again.</body>

        <body>This was my first time at Chima and I must say, it was great. My boyfriend, 7year-old, and I went one 02/18/15(my birthday) and we absolutely enjoyed it! Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t remember any of the waitresses nor waiters due to all that was going on, but they were great!! If you guys worked on Wednesday night, the 18th, you guys were awesome!!! I&apos;m not sure what to call the guys that run around with all of the different selections of beef, pork, lamb, ETC, but they were super attentive and every time I flipped my card to orange, they were there. JORGE, he was one to remember because every time I wanted a certain kind of beef and temperature, he would disappear into the back and just have the perfect slices! It was great and I was so full, I couldn&apos;t even go out for drinks afterwards. It was overwhelming at first, but once you understand the process, you just go with it. :)</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve enjoyed several lovely dinners at Chima. My husband goes for the meat. Me? I go for the sides and the salad and cheese bar. Wonderful place for a special night out.</body>

        <body>We expected prices to increase a bit for NYE 2015 but really??  $79.00 a person for dinner with one glass of Moët?  Food was good but not that good when compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses.  Our servers began ignoring us after a few minutes of serving and with a party of eight, there was always somebody wanting something.  We had to ask for certain meats as we were &quot;overlooked&quot; after the servers finished at the table next to us.  Our waiter had to be flagged down for everything we needed and then we were overcharged as he &quot;forgot&quot; that one member of the party did not eat meat.  Although dinner came with champagne, other than when we first sat with drinks from the bar, our waiter never asked if we were ready for our included glass of bubbly,  and we, in fact, had to clarify with him, at the end of dinner, if we were entitled to it as part of our meal.  He almost seemed annoyed when we had him pour for us.  Staff were not terribly inviting or friendly and the upstairs bar was messy.</body>

        <body>This was the 3rd time I have been to Chima and all 3 visits were excellent.  This past time I sat on the bottom floor which is just as excellent as sitting on the top floor. The bottom floor only has one unisex bathroom, so if you are not comfortable with that, take a walk upstairs.  Arrive early and take advantage of the excellent specialty drinks. Use the 4th street side and take advantage of the complementary parking. Plan for about an 2 hour dinner. We never felt rushed to leave even when they were closing down. I recommend this place to everyone.</body>

        <body>We always have a good time when we go to Chima. We actually went last year on NYE, so this was a second annual tradition for us. I must say that last year was 10 stars! We LOVED it. But this year seemed a bit below par in comparison. My advice: request to sit downstairs. That&apos;s the only thing I can think of that was different from last year. There is a full salad bar and everything upstairs, but we were tucked in a corner at a round table upstairs. Normally, we LOVE this place and for NYE we disregard the price and just go for it. Not sure we&apos;ll spend the money for it next year though. EEK!</body>

        <body>This had been my third time at Chimas and still has not disappointed me. The food is absolutely delicious. The service is amazing, and the overall setting is perfect for almost any occasion. I have not been able to find anything negative about this resturant. I will continue to visit Chimas every chance I get when I am home in the Charlotte Area.</body>

        <body>My husband and son had been to Chima before and liked it.  I feel like it&apos;s a bit pricey, especially for myself and my 11 year old daughter who don&apos;t eat nearly enough meat to be worth the $$.  The kids menu stops at age 10 which is ridiculous.  There should be options for those who don&apos;t want the large portions...</body>

        <body>I was at the start of my meal when I attempted to take another bite. Luckily for me I was looking at what I was eating or I would have eaten an approximate 3-4 in long hair that was entangled in the meat. I brought it up to our waiter who then informed the manager. I was given another plate and utensils and finished my meal. At the end of the meal my brother and I had gift cards for 2 free individual dinners. They accepted the gift cards but then added an automatic 18% gratuity to our bill. Oh and by the way Chima did absolutely nothing about the hair in my food other than advising they would look into it. No discounted meal or anything. I guess the manager did not care that hair was found cooked in the food of a dinner that&apos;s 60 bucks per person.</body>

        <body>The food was delicious as always. We went during restaurant week and decided to upgrade for $15 more pp. The 8 items that were upgrades hardly came around and we had to ask for them. The fish never even came around. Of course we filled up because the good is excellent and the servers are very nice. They just should even out the food they bring out.</body>

        <body>Saturday was my first time at Chima.  The atmosphere was great,  the staff were the friendliest I had ever seen.  The food came right when I needed it at the wine was great!  I can&apos;t wait to go back.</body>

        <body>my husband and I go to Chima as often as we can. We&apos;re new to Charlotte and are thrilled that we found it.  I can&apos;t decide which is better, the food or the service. We literally don&apos;t eat all day to leave room for all the delicious choices. It&apos;s both wonderful for groups or as a romantic evening. Bring your appetite and enjoy!</body>

        <body>Food - way over rated Service - does not listen  I really thought I would enjoy myself but that was not the case.  There are so many great places to eat in Charlotte and I was trying to be fancy.  Oh well, this was a huge waste of time and money.  Never again</body>

        <body>We made reservations during restaurant week and got caught in traffic. When I called the restaurant the hostess Nicole was very nice but told is they could only hold our table for 15 minutes. We luckily arrived in time and I could understand why that&apos;s their policy-they were packed. We were immediately taken to our table which was great-I hate when having a reservation means &quot;next available.&quot; Our main server Nina was helpful and attentive, actually everyone from the &quot;gauchos&quot; serving to the runners bringing sides were  on point and their fun personalities made our meal more enjoyable. The food was delicious of course. Don&apos;t be an amateur and overdo it on the salad bar even though it&apos;s full of fantastic and creative options-a half dozen cheeses, prepared salads and salumi as well as sauces and soups. The meats brought to the table were all excellently prepared and we particularly enjoyed the lamb chops and juicy ribeye. Would have been fun to have some more creative options that we&apos;ve </body>

        <body>We visit Chima during Queen&apos;s Feast with a group. Never disappointed. Always satisfied. Our positive experiences have prompted us to return with guests at other times of the year. It is a steal during Queen&apos;s Feast but still worth it at other times of the year.</body>

        <body>Everyone in the party are employees of The Melting Pot. It is a tradition after we have all worked long and hard through our Charlotte Restaurant Week to treat ourselves to Chimas! We look forward to this because after providing such care and hospitality to our guests for 10 days it is nice to sit back, enjoy great food, great drinks and impeccable service! Tony and Daniel took EXCELENT care of us. We had some first timers that afterwords said &quot;easily the best meal they have ever had&quot; we were there for maybe longer than expected, so I&apos;m sorry if we held the table up into another reservation. But we we taking full advantage of our evening! We thank you again for providing a wonderful and memorable meal to us. We can&apos;t wait for this July to come back. You may even see us before!</body>

        <body>We had to ask for a menu. Took two different waiters to get drinks. After 30 minutes we had only been served two meat choices out of eight offered on the menu. Finally had to ask for meat that all other tables had plenty of. We were supposed to get sides with dinner but they came to our table AFTER we were finished eating. Took 20 minutes to get our check and then we were rudely told by our waiter that he had other tables he was busy with even though all waiters have to do at this restaurant is fill the drinks as everything else is self serve. Waiter told us he was getting the manager but he never showed up. If you cannot handle Restaurant Week then do not participate!!! Will not be back!!!!!</body>

        <body>Come hungry. Seriously. And come with an open mind and eager palate. The salad bar is a nice addition, a great way to start the meal, plus they always have a meat or cheese or other side or but of year that I don&apos;t get to indulge in often.  After that little opener, that&apos;s when the two fun begins. Fresh hot meats, sliced for you table side. Even the little appetizers and side they bring out are phenomenal. Try new things. The roast leg of lamb is delicious, and they know how to cook a steak. My favorite is the top sirloin, the way they get the outside char perfectly almost-crispy and the meat is diet tender and superb.  The only thing I can&apos;t review is their dessert options. We&apos;ve never had enough room to try it!  The food is excellent; the service is attentive, prompt, pleasant, and unobtrusive; the atmosphere is just right: not so din as to be hard to see, lights low enough to be relaxing.  Eat here. Seriously. Do it.</body>

        <body>We have been to Chima multiple times over the last 6 years.  It&apos;s one of our favorite restaurants.  We recently went during restaurant week.  The service, which is usually exceptional, was just okay.  I felt like their salad bar was a little lacking compared to what it normally is.  Our servers seemed preoccupied.  I felt a little like a nuisance to them.  When I&apos;m paying for a nice meal, I would hope the servers wouldn&apos;t make me feel uncomfortable.   It was quite loud that evening as well.  One reason we enjoy Chima is because we usually enjoy a somewhat quiet, intimate dining experience.  We have 4 young children, so we have all the loud we can handle at home.  When we are able to have a date alone, some quiet is nice.  Overall the experience left us wanting.</body>

        <body>We took advantage of the Queen&apos;s Feast Charlotte Restaurant week at Chima.  The food and service was wonderful as it always is.  One complaint though.  It was the first time dinning up stairs which was fine, but I wished our table had not been in the middle of the floor near the salad bar as my chair kept getting bumped by other diners passing by which was a little annoying.  Otherwise we had a great time with our friends as always!</body>

        <body>We had reservations for a group of 10;but six of us arrived at one time and two more were in the area looking for parking CIAA wkend. The greeter stated that they needed the majority of the group there before we could be seated.  From my elementary math class;  anything over half....makes it the majority!! So, once we were seated...everything else was exceptional!!! Great food and great staff and service!</body>

        <body>I also dine here when it&apos;s not restaurant week so I know what I should expect. The food during restaurant week is not as good. Especially the parmesan pork which is normally my favorite. It was overcooked and not nearly as flavorful.</body>

        <body>This was my second time coming to Chima during Resturant week however I&apos;ve been other times many times before. Last year when we went the service was outstanding and we literally had a cowboy at our table every ten seconds. This year I invited my parents and unfortunately we didn&apos;t have the same experience. We sat upstairs tucked away in the far back corner. We uograded to the full menu but definitely shouldn&apos;t have because we literally had to flag down the cowboys to get them to even come back to our table. The filet, sirloin. And salmon/swordfish made it to our table only once even after requesting numerous times. There were multiple times we we&apos;re sitting for 5 minutes at a time waiting with nothing on our plate. Overall I was extremely disappointed. For a 200 dollar meal I would expect superb service and this time you guys fell short.</body>

        <body>As we have visited Chima on many occasions I need to say that there is never a lack of attentive staff. They wait on you and and foot almost to the point you want to tell them to sit at your table and take a break. You will never hear a no regardless of your request. Thus is very interactive so if you are looking for a romantic dinner this wouldn&apos;t be the best choice because there really isn&apos;t any alone time but that&apos;s not such a bad thing if you like to he waited on hand and foot. For the many parents that never get a break this is a great place to let someone else do ALL the work for you. They won&apos;t even let you get your own plate. They will NOT disappoint, this is what real service is like ladies and gentlemen!</body>

        <body>OMG...this was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had! From the time you walk in, its a very warm and inviting atmosphere. I had reservations and was seated immediately. The process was explained and from that point on they make sure that you are full when you leave.  The top sirloin melts in your mouth. I dont even eat red meat, but I will if it comes from here. The salad bar is unlike all others...I recommend the rice, mousse, calamari salad, artichokes, roasted red peppers, black beans with pork and if you like hot food spice it up with the peppers and hot sauce at the end of the bar where the dressings are.  I would recommend honestly tryinng everything though from the salad bar. It gives you the chance to expand your pallet and you might end up liking foods you would have never tried before.</body>

        <body>Basically, Chima is an upscale Golden Corral.  The food is plentiful...and average.  If you are looking to have a number of different proteins at one sitting, and limitless portions, then this is the place for you.  But if you are looking for the best steaks, chops, fish or chicken then look elsewhere.  (For the same price you can go to Del Friscos, The Palm, Capital Grille, or Ruth&apos;s Chris and have a far better dining experience.) The salad bar is nice, but not exceptional.  There really isn&apos;t any more selection than at the salad bar at the Morrocroft Harris Teeter.  Regarding the service, our waitstaff was top notch; very friendly and attentive.  Service is provided in teams and one of the team members waiting on our table was very knowledgeable and helpful regarding wines.  Would I go back?  Not if I were paying the tab.</body>

        <body>Let&apos;s start by saying that their customer service was formidable our waitress Nina and the guys that rotate with the meat were so pleasant and professional we loved Chris !!! The salad bar was very very good enjoyed every item I picked very fresh and the vegetable rice and sea food salad was outstanding .. The ravizio style was interesting and an experience in itself the lamb cuts every single one of it was delicious very well seasoned the same goes for the rib eye cut how ever THAT WAS IT!! I was very very dissapointed with all of the other cuts they were all blend no flavor what so ever the chicken every style I got was dry with no taste unless you got a bacon wrap .. I hope they improve their seasoning  to have that much meat going around and being ruined by the flavor is a shame ..the focus should be the food and the experience not just the experience of having meat going around on sticks with no flavor at all for the price the quality of the meat should be outstanding not just ok</body>

        <body>I went to Chima for the legendary Rodizio service that I love so much. I was first sat in the restaurant and was greeted immediately by Brian and Cory my servers. I told them that I would like a glass of wine and the meat service, I was accommodated immediately and the food was hot and fresh. The management team were very nice and Jeanine,  John , Mr. Neto came by frequently to see how my meal was going. I have dined here several times and keep returning because of the service and experience I have had here. I feel like I know everyone there and am apart of the family. I will be back and recommend that you try Chima and see what it&apos;s all about.</body>

        <body>We dined in Chima during the Qeen&apos;s Feast and noted that the $30 menu was really limited then they would conveniently upgrade you to the regular full rodizio experience for the full price.  The idea of the  Queen Feast was to get people to try your restaurant but what it really did was turn us away from it.  Sadly we won&apos;t return.</body>

        <body>While this was a wonderful experience and the food, service, and atmosphere outstanding I was shocked at the price when I received my bill. I&apos;m not sure if it was a special Valentine&apos;s Day price that I wasn&apos;t told about, but it cost about $100 more than I expected based on my research from their web site and reviews of their establishment.</body>

        <body>From the moment we walked in , to being seated my daughter and I were so excited to be at this restaurant for the first time. The salad bar had a plethora of items to choose from . All the servers were so polite and ready to assist when needed. It was my birthday so I was served a piece of tiramisu  which was divine!!! The food was hot , the tea was sweet, the service was outstanding. I couldn&apos;t have asked for a better birthday dinner. I really enjoyed myself. My daughter and I will be back to eat in the future.</body>

        <body>Reservation confirmation voicemail was rude.  Like they honestly didn&apos;t care if you came or not, but if you did, then you needed to be on time and bring cash.  Complimentary valet was nice.  We were seated 20 minutes after our reservation.  No one at the front desk looked happy about their job.  No friendly welcome.  No smiles.  The food was fair, at best.  The service was the same.  The bathrooms were disgusting.  The cocktail list is pretty limited.  They didn&apos;t disclose that the gratuities were already included in the checks, which I thought was pretty shady.  This was my second, and last time there.  Too overpriced for such a ghetto scene.</body>

        <body>We did have to wait about 15 mins past our reservation time to get seated. It was busy, the service was a little slow. The food was outstanding! The salad bar was filled with fresh choices. The side of fried bananas was delicious! All the cuts of meat were great! The meat service was slow at first and took a while before we got the chicken. I enjoyed the parmesan pork, bacon wrapped chicken, and garlic steak.</body>

        <body>This was my second time and it was just as good as the first. We were closer to the kitchen so we got all the meat and it was hot.  Loved most of the meat but some were not as good. It wasn&apos;t because of the way it was cooked, I just didn&apos;t care for it. My husband loved it and we had our 14 month old son with us. He loved the mashed pototatoes...lol. We would definitely go back and I was glad they had booster chairs and high chairs for small kids.</body>

        <body>Overall not satisfied at all with this steakhouse. Seemed that all the food at this place was ok except for the meat (Which is supposed to be their specialty?)  The Salad bar was pretty good.... not great.... pretty good. Decent selection and most of the salads were fair to average. Some of the salads looked like they had been sitting there for quite a while. Not exactly sure if that was the case but they looked as thought they had been. I didn&apos;t try the soup, looked like it had been in the pot for some time.  The service was Above Average. We got to our table almost immediately after we arrived and the hostess even offered to take our bags while we ate. Our wait staff was courteous and attentive. They really seemed like they enjoyed what they do. The Passadores who served the meat were fast and efficient and would quickly spot your &quot;puck&quot; if it happened to be in the &quot;give me meat&quot; position. Probably one of the better staffs I&apos;ve Seen.  The meat in general was truly a disappointment. </body>

        <body>I&apos;m from Philadelphia working in Charlotte. My wife came down for New Years Eve. We went to Chima and had the best Brazialian food we&apos;ve ever eaten. The service was great. The atmosphere was perfect. My wife loves to cook and the chicken absolutely blew her mind. I&apos;d recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal.</body>

        <body>When I made the online reservation through Open Table, I put a comment in the box that is was my husband&apos;s birthday. There was a glass of champagne for each of us on the table when when arrived and they treated him to a birthday dessert without my having to mention it at the restaurant. We had an amazing time!</body>

        <body>This was our first time to Chima and we were very unimpressed due its the lack of variety and quality.  We have gone to Texas de Brazil many times before and were surprised at the difference between the two restaurants.  Whereas Texas de Brazil has a great salad bar selection, including various cheeses, various cold meats, many olive types, smoked salmon, lobster bisque, etc, Chima has a more limited selection: two cheese types, one deli meat, two olive types, no salmon, vegetable soup, etc.  The service was poor.  Our main waitress ignored half of our party and despite everyone saying that we had never been there before, no one explained how things worked.  We had to explain to the other members of our party what the red/green disc meant, etc.  The servers bringing the meat around were not always careful.  The meats were either too dry (the chicken), fatty (the pork), or so bloody that you better bring an umbrella.  Worst fried bananas that we ever had.  We never knew that roasted re</body>

        <body>We were really looking forward to trying Chima for the first time. We were at a table for 6 and at first I thought conversation might be difficult but as we settled in it was fine. Noise level is active. Seating &amp; greeting were above expectation being a crowded night. Selections &amp; service were stop on. Salad bar was a treat for the eye and palate. Fun and varied selections.one in our group a vegetarian and was delighted and satisfied. Waiters &amp; Gauchos charming. We had a wonderful bottle of 1/2 priced wine which we really enjoyed.Give it a try, unique dining experience.</body>

The food was excellent, even better than expected.  Our servers asked if there were any particular cuts of meat we&apos;d like to try, and were quick to bring items cooked to your liking.

        <body>We made reservations for our sons 18th birthday and still had to wait 40 minutes.  We kind of expected that as there was a big event downtown.  Service was great!  We had an awesome waiter that was very attentive.  The food was great. We did have an issue towards the end of the meal.  For some reason the manager decided to leave the front door open, while the temperature was in the upper 30&apos;s and it was slightly windy outside. We were seated close to the door.   I found that to be inconsiderate.  I waited a little bit and had to go up to the front and let someone know.  I refused to put on my jacket while enjoying our birthday celebration.  After I said something the door was closed.</body>

The array of items on the salad bar was very innovative and something to suit all the very varied tastes in our group. Selection of meats was very tasty. It was a fun evening for all of us.</body>

        <body>Perfect romantic dinner for our anniversary and right before a Blumenthal show. Decent wine list, they were very accommodating and our server was knowledgeable and friendly. They gifted us an amazing tiramisu and bubbly for the occasion which was a very nice surprise.</body>

        <body>Food and service were good. Definitely not a place for romantic conversation, due to the type of place It Is - with wait staff constantly bringing meat skewers to table.  Too Loud for group setting. Was my third trip to chima&apos;s. Will continue to go back.</body>

        <body>I hadn&apos;t had Chima for a while and Restaurant Week seemed like as good a reason as any to visit Chima again.  A 25-40% discount is great, but being able to treat a 16-year old to Chima for the first time for her birthday was priceless.  As always, the food and service were perfect.</body>

        <body>I am glad we went during restaurant week and didn&apos;t have to pay the regular price. The dining experience was very fast paced and for what you pay-- they had us in and out in 45mins. It was something different to experience but I can&apos;t say I would ever go back.</body>

        <body>As part of The Queen&apos;s Feast and Charlotte Restaurant week, we try a new restaurant every year. Last year it was Armor de Brazil. This year we went with Chima. Since they are both labeled as upscale Brazilian restaurants, I must say, if you are looking for the rodizio style, Armor is the better choice for the money. At Chima, the waiter immediately tried to up sell the full menu instead of the &quot;lesser restaurant week&quot; menu. Only tap water is included for $48 a person. At Armor the restaurant week menu was the full menu, and included a beverage of your choice. The salad bar at Chima was extremely limited, and the atmosphere was anything but upscale. The location is great, and you immediately see the &quot;proper attire required&quot; sign as you walk in. Women in stretchy pants and men in ragged jeans and a t-shirt is not my definition of upscale. There were also many loud children (infants and toddlers) throughout the place. One shining star for sure  (other than the initial up sell) was the wa</body>

        <body>Chima&apos;s is an experience, not just another restaurant. In order to enjoy it, however, you must go hungry! The alcohol is expensive but worth it, and so is the spring water. However it is noisy and you should be prepared to wait, even with a resarvation. Other than that I loved it and enjoyed the outstanding service and food.</body>

        <body>If you are a meat eater this place is amazing. All you can eat of some of the best cuts of meat. Remember to not fill up on the salad bar. Save room for the many selections of beef, chicken, lamb and pork.   Chima is definitely expensive. For those wondering, it is $50 a person. For the two of us with two drinks each and no dessert it was $185 after tip and tax.</body>

        <body>Knowing food was going to be fantastic, I was really impressed with the service.  They stayed on top of keeping our plates filled with meat.  But they also paid attention to what we said.  One of the servers heard me mention that I was looking forward to trying their Ribeye.  Next thing I know, someone is bringing a skewer of Ribeye to my table.  Even later when I glanced at a menu, another server came up and asked if I was looking for something specific or wanted more Ribeye.  That&apos;s fantastic attention to the customer and greatly appreciated.  :)</body>

        <body>meat wasn&apos;t always hot, in fact there were times where it wasn&apos;t even warm.  the meat was plentiful and those serving it were very nice and helpful. our whole table noticed the waiter made a face when we did not wish to order cocktails there are recovering alcoholics in this family and no one wanted to make them uncomfortable ( sorry your check didn&apos;t get high enough mr waiter) he also was the same way when we didn&apos;t want dessert and was hard selling it to say the least. With that being said the meat was still very good and when hot exceptional.  we had a very nice time the waiter just needs some attitude training you don&apos;t act smug to anyone none the less customers.</body>

        <body>Our server was so attentive and when we informed her that we had not been served anything in awhile she was right on it!  Bianca I think...sorry brother was in town so I was a bit distracted hosting. We happened to come in during restaurant week so decided to partake. It was good but we probably should have just enjoyed the regular experience. Wine selection was very tasty. I really want to commend everyone for keeping such a good attitude in such a hard 10 days. You are all working so hard and I feel so grateful to have been served and taken care of by such a great staff. Thank you for running on empty and still smiling I&apos;ve done it so I know it takes a little extra to make it happen ;)</body>

        <body>We went here for our first year anniversary. Everything was perfect. We were assisted well. We felt really important. The food was awesome and the service was the best we&apos;ve had. We were even given a free dessert with &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot; written on it.</body>

        <body>It was my first time there so i learned by the end that when they come to your table, it isn&apos;t necessarily a different meat and it&apos;s hard to understand them when they tell you what it is. Next time, I will make sure I get to try all of the meats because there were a few I didn&apos;t get. All of them were great and the salad bar is awesome. Very nice bar area.</body>

        <body>Been coming to Chima&apos;s for the past 5 years since moving to Uptown Charlotte. Never disappointing. Impeccable service and excellent meats/seafood. The salad bar selection were nice. But beware...this is Rodizio, so come with an empty stomach and don&apos;t eat too much from the salad bar, or you&apos;ll be full before you get to try all of the meat/seafood selections!</body>

        <body>We took our daughter there for her 15th birthday on Monday. Our whole party came down with food poisoning after eating there and 2 members had to be treated at the hospital! We contacted the restaurant and spoke to GM &quot;Fernando&quot;. He refused to refund our money and suggested we return again; has he lost his mind? Needless to say I am in contact with their corporate office in an effort to get a refund and our hospital bills paid. If we cant resolve it at that level, I will consult with an attorney to see what our options are... THIS IS NOT RIGHT! Also, they have critical violations listed with the NC Dept of Health- storing raw food with ready to eat items. BEWARE! If you want to loose time from work and costly hospital bills-BON APPETITIE!</body>

        <body>Not what we were expecting.  Not comparable to other Brazilian Steakhouses that we&apos;ve been to like Texas de Brazil. Meat lacked flavor. Salad bar was okay. Even desserts seemed like they were pre-packaged.  Very disappointed, particularly for price we paid, which was 300 plus for a party of 5.</body>

        <body>I love Chima and I&apos;ve been there several times.  Food tastes great and I the atmosphere is very nice.  The only thing I don&apos;t like is that 3 times in a row within the last year, I&apos;ve gotten sick with gastrointestinal issues before the dinner even ended.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the meat seasoning or something else causing this.  Other folks in my party felt fine, although I&apos;ve had other visits when people in my party got sick too a little later.  Beats me.  I recommend it- Maybe you won&apos;t have the same issues as I have had.</body>

        <body>I dined here with a friend during Restaurant Week.  The place was hopping, but the service was good.  Towards the end of the evening, the skewers circulated less frequently.  The quality was ok.  This is the best choice for this concept.</body>

        <body>We took our 4 children out for an evening of fine dining during Restaurant Week.  The waiter, Joseph, was very kind and even brought my daughter a special piece of cake with sorbet to celebrate her birthday.  All of the servers were great with my 10, 12, 14 and 16 year-olds.</body>

        <body>Good not great. Went for restaurant week which was probably part of the problem. Service was mediocre, they were very kind but I had to ask every time I needed a refill; had to flag someone down anytime I needed anything really. Food was okay but they didn&apos;t have everything they were offering on the menu and all of the meats seemed a touch over cooked.   I&apos;m glad I experienced it but I probably wouldn&apos;t go back. Lovely restaurant, though!</body>

        <body>My husband and I ate at Chima for Valentine&apos;s Day.  The food was ok, but the service was terrible.  The rolls and metballs were cold, and the waiter only came to our table a couple of times during the entire 1.5 hours we were there.  Our package was expensive, and there was supposed to be a photo included.  The photographer never came to our table after passing it several times.  This is the second time we have eaten at Chima, and I am not sure I will go back again, nor will I recommend for any future work function.  Fogo De Chao is much better.  Very disappointed.</body>

        <body>If you are not very hungry, this is not the place for you. Yes the place is a little pricey, but it is worth every penny. I took my girlfriend there for her birthday. I told her not to eat earlier because she would be very happy for dinner. The food was amazing! We both left miserable and will definitely be going back.</body>

        <body>The salad bar was messy, the meat overall was tasty. The ribs were tough. Service was ok. Glad I tried it. Never again. The grade by health dept. Caught my very eye. Some people can eat anything  and anywhere. Im not that girl.</body>

        <body>This is our second time dinning at Chima&apos;s and we were not disappointed.  The meats were well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The lamb is the most tender,  flavorful lamb I have ever tasted. The cocktail was different, but also very good. I had the walnut cream dessert and enjoyed every bite. My only criticism is that I would have liked to see more cuts of meat. Other than that, this place is now my number one spot when I go home to Charlotte.</body>

        <body>I posted before about how much I love Chima, this time was no different. This place keeps sucking me back in :). My favorite cuts are Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin (I think this is what is known as Picanha in other places) and Flank Steak Service is particularly outstanding. At one point the &quot;Chef de Rang&quot; (i.e. Head Server) came to me and said &quot;Sir I noticed the last cut of flank steak we served you is cooked more than what you like. I asked the chef to cook 2 pieces of flank steaks medium-rare just for you, they should come out very shortly&quot;. And sure enough, two minutes later 2 plates of medium-rare flank steak arrive at our table... now that&apos;s excellent service!!</body>

        <body>I had booked a table of 7 weeks in advance for my 29th birthday celebration with my best friends. We had been waiting for years to be able to get into the always booked Chima Brazilian Steakhouse. The only time available was 9:30 which was okay with us since one of our party didn&apos;t get off work till 8pm. My husband and I got the upgraded queens feast and the rest of our party did the regular 30 dollar deal. The salad bar was a bit bland with the only really good things being the Cesar Salad and the cheese selection. We were served Top Sirloin, a tiny bite size piece of Filet Mignon, Filet Wrapped in Bacon, Ribeye, Leg of Lamb, Lamb Chops, Ribs, Chicken Wrapped in Bacon and Sausage. We did not get any of the promised seafood that we should have received with the package upgrade nor did we get a piece of cake with a candle to celebrate my birthday when we watched another patron get one. We really felt rushed and like they were just bringing us the left overs from the kitchen and we did </body>

        <body>I have been to Chima several times and this was by far the worst experience. The service was terrible. The restaurant seemed unprepared for New Year&apos;s Eve traffic although it has been a popular choice for years. The food was mediocre and had to keep asking for certain cuts of meat to be brought to the table. Valet parking was bad as I had to wait 45 minutes for my car. Really disappointed and will not return.</body>

        <body>My husband and I went for a date night (which is rare).  The bar was great for a couple of drinks and the atmosphere was cool.  It wasn&apos;t quiet and it wasn&apos;t crazy either.  Just a different place to go uptown.  We had a great time and would go back for a special occasion.  The service was great, however, I did feel like they were anxious to take away your plate, even when we weren&apos;t ready for them to.  The salad bar is awesome with a ton of variety.  I saw a lot of families there with kids as well, so I would say it is kid friendly.</body>

        <body>I like the concept, but it really doesn&apos;t feel worth the price. I&apos;m glad I tried it out but I will probably never go back. There are other restaurants in walking distance that have better bang for the buck.</body>

        <body>This last visit was not a great experience. It was merely an &apos;fair&apos; one.  For the price per person you should be completely satisfied with service and food. Waiter was friendly and quick. Problem was with the actual food service. The meat runners came in strong at the beginning but not with the right cuts of meat. When asked about a particular meat, they would say they will ask the guy to come over but never did.  A lot of chicken and not much of else.   Fish was severely overcooked. Lamb chops and filet were nowhere to be found. Filet did show up only after repeated asks.  Towards the end, even with the right chip color on top, the runners would just grace by the table without making eye contact and not stop.  I have decided that it is better to spend $55 at a nice steakhouse and get your steak the-way-you-want-it.   Hoping Fogo de Chao makes it to Charlotte soon!</body>

        <body>Bianca and company took great care of my girlfriend and I. We were seated at an upstairs table by the window (upon request) shortly after our 8pm reservation giving us a perfect amount of time to grab a pre-dinner cocktail. Once seated service was prompt and attentive. Even though there were menu upgrades available Bianca took the time to explain all of the reasturant week menu options and we did not feel pressured into the more expensive choice. This was very important to me as i overheard other servers bluntly trying to upsell the more expensive menu and diclscounted bottles of wine. In the end we orderder the full Rodizo menu and were not dissapointed!  The filet was melt in your mouth and the top sirloin was a pleasant suprise. Generous portions of everything but the fish were availabe seemingly instantly. All of our food was hot and full of flavor, and the amazing lady backwait (forgot her name sorry!) even brought us extra bananas for dessert.  All and all we left happy and very</body>

        <body>I would like to start off by saying that the customer service was awesome and our servers and particularly our Waiter was Great. WE REALLY ENJOYED OUR WAITER. He help us to understand the concept of the menu items very well. Our waiter and the manager also helped to accommodate for a few at my table. I would have to say that the meats were delicious and my group of friends enjoyed it. I do think and everyone at my table thinks that the side select was very fair. I was looking for sides like mashed potatoes, corn, green beans, macaroni and cheese, and etc. But overall our experience was great, and we all enjoyed ourselves, Thank You. You help to make my birthday, one we all won&apos;t FORGET.</body>

        <body>Fogo or Texas de Brazil are better choices for sure and in general, there are much better choices for foodies in the downtown Charlotte area. Bill for 4 of us with a few drinks was over $600. I definitely do not think I got my money&apos;s worth.</body>

        <body>This has been the 3rd or 4th visit. Service was completely lacking. The attention from the servers and gauchos seems to have dropped. We went for Queens Feast but decided to go full Rodizio. The gauchos were everywhere we were not. Based on price for dinner and the service and food received... We felt like we over paid.</body>

        <body>This is my 4th time at China . 2 for restaurant week and 2 are not. I do not think we will be going back for a very long time after my last experience at Chima. I realize it was restaurant week and these places get people in and out as fast as they can... but this was ridiculous!! We sat down and got our salad bar ...by the way we upgraded to get the seafood. (which we had to remind our server more then once that we did pay for the upgrade. The same 6 servers swarmed around the table .We didn&apos;t even get to sit down and eat our salad before they started asking if we wanted the meat. The little card was turned to no thanks and they still came around. I realize again it was restaurant week and its a little crazy ....but I think the difference between being accommodating and being rushed was definitely mistaken . I never complain and this is MY 1ST time but I was really disappointed. Besides it was both my husbands and my  birthday. Which was Jan 24th</body>

        <body>We came during restaurant week and the only reservation time that we could get on a Saturday was 10 pm.   We were seated by 945 pm and our server was very attentive without being overbearing.  We were seated near the kitchen so there was lots of activity but it didn&apos;t distract too much.  The salad bar was awesome I want the recipe for the grilled artichoke salad.   The appetizers were ok.  We couldnt keep up with the pace the meat came out.  The sirloin, ribeye, bacon wrapped chicken were good.  Not a fan of the lamb.  If it was t so pricey i would go back for the salad bar only.  ok</body>

        <body>We visited during Queen&apos;s Feast (Restaurant Week). We had been very excited about this restaurant and had heard amazing things about the food and the service. Upon arriving, we were seated quickly, but it was only downhill from here.  We met our server and were asked what we would like to drink. I ordered a drink from the bar and my husband just wanted water. After 20 minutes, my drink was delivered. I had practically forgot I even ordered it as I was well into my meal already. We were offered the $30.00 option for the restaurant week pricing or a $15.00 upgrade to try all the meats. We went ahead and paid the upgrade to be able to really try everything that was available. I started at the salad bar and was impressed with the choices but really let down with the quality. The Caesar salad was soggy and must have been sitting there soaking in dressing for a while. The cheese platters were messy and some of the items were gone with no one attending to refill them. Needless to say, I cert</body>

        <body>Let me start this off by saying I am a manager at a well known restaurant and have been in the business for 10 plus years. I don&apos;t like to complain but I feel this was a have to situation. The overall experience was great and the service was great. We really enjoyed the salad bar and the dessert. So much so that we might return only for the salads. The meat on the other hand was not great. Out of the 16 meats we tried the only thing I could eat was the top sirloin. The meat was overcooked, very dry and sometimes cold and no seasoning on any of them. I originally had reservations at another place we love but I wanted to take someone special out for his birthday where we had never been. We were both very dissappointed considering everyone that I talked to said the food was really good. To me it was not worth the money and wished I would have kept my reservations to the other restaurant. It would not have been so dissapointing if it wasn&apos;t a special occasion. I was really looking forward</body>

        <body>The good at Chima is incredible for the money.  I love great restaurants and this is great.  I don&apos;t give 4 stars or more often but this place deserves them.  Service started off a bit wobbly but they righted the ship abd finished strong.  Great cold bar, that isn&apos;t do much a salad bar but a hit messy accompaniment bar.  And the roasted to sirloin and ribeye were amazing!</body>

        <body>We had such a great time! Most of the time during restaurant week, waiters aren&apos;t the nicest. We had Renzo and he was fantastic! He made us feel welcomed from the second we sat down. I really can&apos;t say enough about the service that he provided us. The food was WONDERFUL and we left very satisfied. Thank you for a fantastic night out!</body>

        <body>This was not my first time at Chima&apos;s.  My previous visits were pleasurable and were usually late in the week.  This visit was on a Tuesday evening and I was surprised to find that it was like pulling teeth to get a server to come to my table.  The meat selection was the same I&apos;m guessing.  However, It was if my table went unnoticeable.  The guys with the skewers filled with meats were by passing my table.  When a manager I&apos;m guessing came over and asked how things were going with our meal, I voiced this to her.  For some strange reason after me putting her on notice the slack service still continued.  The restaurant was not crowded by any means and the wait service was actually just standing around doing nothing.  I don&apos;t know if the fact that we were patrons of color made a difference that night.  It never had before, but the service really sucked.</body>

        <body>The place was packed, loud, and obnoxious. The premise is an &quot;all you can eat&quot; restaurant but food was only brought around twice and to get any more you had to flag your waiter down(who was avoiding us for no reason) the beer and cocktails were way over priced and the salad bar was nasty. I highly recommend taking advantage of restaurant week somewhere other than Chima.</body>

        <body>You&apos;re paying for the experience (and all the meat, lol). The meat was mostly dry. The salad bar didn&apos;t have many good selections. That&apos;s where the sides seemed to have been? I wouldn&apos;t go back. Over priced and not worth it.</body>

        <body>I eat here fairly frequently with some friends. My wife is vegetarian so she usually makes other plans, but after I assured her there were plenty of vegetarian options on the HUGE salad bar, she decided to come with me.  Obviously the meat is incredible, but even my wife had more than enough options with the bar. When she asked if a particular soup was made with chicken stock (it was), the manager took it upon himself to ask the chef to make her some soup with vegetable stock and brought it to our table. That is quality service! I&apos;m glad that now my wife can join me at my favorite spot in town.</body>

        <body>Took my 15 year old sons here for a bday dinner.  We were seated at a table next to the serving area.  The servers kept running into my sons chair.  When I mentioned this to my server he said...yes, that would keep happening. Seriously, that&apos;s ok to them lol.  I said we should pull the table back out of the line of traffic. He thought that was brilliant lol and he moved it back to the wall. Wow.  Some cuts of meat were good but none great. Filet should be tender not tough.  Most cuts I tried were very fatty. A couple pieces all fat, I tried to find a lean bite then gave up and pushed aside.   Service on the meats was great, but forget it if you need another drink, or the check...or worst of all any change from your check! There are so many better restaurants nearby I&apos;d suggest skipping over this one.</body>

        <body>This was my first time dining here and I had a great experience. The salad bar was extensive and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. I loved that the meat items came out piping hot so I knew they were fresh out of the oven/kitchen. The drinks we had at the bar were delicious. The only thing I didn&apos;t like was the location of our table. My husband and I were seated at a two person table right in front of the elevator shaft which is practically in the lounge area. I didn&apos;t ask to move since I do work in the restaurant industry and I understand that they were busy but definitely would have liked a table in or closer to the dining room.</body>

        <body>1st time participating in Queen&apos;s Feast.  #1 Restaurant that I knew I had to try.  Reservation told them I was a 1st time visitor.  Staff was very helpful in explaining how a Brazilian restaurant works and the servers never seemed frustrated when we asked questions or didn&apos;t understand something. Salad Bar is AMAZING!  Such an interesting experience.  Able to try new dishes and new cuts of meat.    I have to mention that I walk with a cane and the hostess took us down like 3 steps...she kept stopping to make sure I was okay, had her hand reaching out the whole time, and stepped towards me asking if I was sure that she couldn&apos;t help me.  Really appreciated that she didn&apos;t make it seem like a bother that she had to walk slower.   Will definitely be using this as a &quot;Special Occasion&quot; favorite!  :)</body>

        <body>i love the salad bar.. i am trying to stay away from meat and chicken, but my family loves to eat meat.. i chose this place because you can get everything on their rich salad bar and get grilled salmon and sword fish while my children and wife can try the best variety of meat and chicken,</body>

        <body>My husband and I went to Chima&apos;s for our anniversary and had an incredible experience. All of the food was amazing, but it was the staff that really stood out. Everyone was friendly and happy to give recommendations. We were even surprised with a complimentary dessert that had &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot; written in chocolate. We are already planning our next visit!</body>

        <body>Salad bar and sides were awesome and the meat selection was great! All of the meats were seasoned to perfection. We had amazing service, and gauchos (meat servers) came around frequently and were very pleasant. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!</body>

        <body>This was my second time enjoying lunch at chima. I opted  for the salad bar with grilled salmon. My colleague opted for salad only. Both of us enjoyed the many options provided by the impressive  salad bar. Everything was fresh and we&apos;ll presented.  My salmon was cooked perfectly to my specifications.  The best part was the price- only 10.90 for salad and 15.90 with a 6 Oz portion of salmon. They also offer a chicken option for 12.90 and a 10oz top sirloin for 14.90. Service was attentive without being intrusive.</body>

        <body>My significant other and I went to Chima for Philadelphia Restaurant Week. I had been to a Chima in another location before so I knew what to expect. On this specific night, the restaurant was absolutely packed. I made a reservation a week in advance, and still had to wait about 25 minutes past my reservation time. My significant other had to get to work after dinner so we were kind of in a rush. I informed the hostess and checked to see if anything could be done to sit us sooner, she sat us in the corner of the restaurant by the bar, in a little side space that wasn&apos;t really being used at the moment. I liked that area because it was away from the buzz of the main dining room (so many people, so much noise!), but because the area was not being used at the moment, we weren&apos;t getting much attention from the gauchos (the servers walking around with the meat). After about 20 minutes that we weren&apos;t approached by a single server, I complained to a waitress, and after that, not only were we</body>

        <body>Service and food quality was great but was very disappointed that there were meat limitations for the slightly reduced restaurant week cost. Did they really need to take the lamb chops, filet and rib eye away from me??!!</body>

        <body>One of two famous Brazilian steak house in town. Beautiful dining room, friendly staff, but food aren&apos;t the best. Food loses consistancy in quality throughout the night. Medium is not always the same kind of pink, but that can be easily forgiven. The amount of salt of the meat is wildly different all the time. Sometimes I take a bite the meat is well seasoned, the other time, I feel like I just bite into salt itself. The salad bar is very standard and elegant, but quit a few missing items, i.e. Bacon, apple salad, etc. of course, meat is more important than the salad bar.</body>

        <body>A little pricy, but great food and even better service.  There are several selections of different cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and fish along with an incredible salad/veggie/side bar.  You won&apos;t go away hungry and if you enjoy your meat... you will deferentially get your fill.</body>

        <body>After arriving for lunch, we could see the only server on was too busy. A manager gave us water and explained the restaurant. We have been here many times for dinner and always enjoyed it. We finished or salads and then waited 15 minutes for meats to come around. Only the flank steak came out. About ten minutes later the garlic sirloin showed up. The potatoes were cold the first time, sent them back and they were cold again, to which the manager told me&quot; they are not cold I checked them myself&quot;. He then brought out a giant bowl of microwaved potatoes. We look forward to eating at Chima but not for lunch. We didn&apos;t even meet our server till halfway thru lunch. Very disappointed</body>

        <body>Chima was everything that was promised; the constant supply of excellent meat was astounding! It was prepared well, and the variety was great. I could not eat nearly the amount my husband could.... Chima is best for the very hungry meat eating man! The surprise for us was the incredible salad bar- in addition to the obvious salad bar choices, it included some interesting and gourmet treats, eg. the Gorgonzola mousse, seafood salad, and carpaccio, soups, and a nice selection of fresh vegetables.  Oh, and those little cheesy rolls they kept bringing to the table.  Dessert was offered gratis since it was our anniversary.  The tiramisu was great... As a breakfast treat the next day!</body>

        <body>This was the 2nd time I have been to Chima and it did not disappoint.  Everything was great.  Salad bar has lots of choices and is not your run-of-the-mill salad bar.  Service was great, the waitstaff was very attentive despite the fact that it was the dinner rush (Reservation was at 6pm).  The meat is excellent, my favorite this time was the filet mignon, which you could practically cut with a fork and melted in your mouth!   Great all around, will definitely be back for a third time!</body>

        <body>My husband and I had been to other Brazilian Steakhouses before, but this was our first trip to Chima Restaurant in Philly! It was in honor of my husband&apos;s birthday and I would say it was an exceptional experience. The food was delectable, the host was gracious and the other waiters were courteous. Our meal was served promptly without delay and everything we placed in our mouth was delicious! I even had one glass of the finest Malbec, it was of the Uco Valley Region in comparison to most that come from Medoza (Argentina). It was smooth and worth the price!  We also received a free tiramasu with a candle in it for dessert.  . The room is a little dimmer than most other restaurants we have been to, but I think it adds to the romantic ambiance.  Overall, it was a great experience</body>

        <body>We were a little surprised to find that the Restaurant Week menu was a cut down version of the regular menu. This coupled with the fact that their staff seemed overwhelmed by a full house and the quality of food was not up to par made for a dissapointing evening.</body>

        <body>Great food and has all the trimmings of good caliber Brazilian Steakhouses. The &quot;salad&quot; bar could use more salad and more &quot;American&quot; selections. But overall definitely a good time and place to eat.</body>

        <body>If you are going here solely for the meats then you will enjoy your meal they were delicious. I was hoping for some sides that would complement the main meat dishes but was very disappointed. Most of the sides were fried and flavorless, and the mashed potatoes were unrecognizable (sticky white goop and my fiancé thought it was sour cream). Service was great and was able to try every selection we wanted. However for the price, id much rather enjoy a full meal at one of the other great restaurants center city has to over.</body>

        <body>We dined at Chima for our wedding anniversary.  Our reservation was early as we also had tickets to see Dirty Dancing so it wasn&apos;t crazy busy as it gets with a later Friday night reservation.  We were seated right away.  The free valet parking was a great amenity but  They&apos;re only doing it till March 31.  Megan and the other wait staff were very attentive but not hovering.  Dirty dishes were removed promptly and Megan asked what we wanted sent over.  I always loved the salad bar but they improved it even better than it was before.  The sopressato and prosciutto were great and all the vegetables were very fresh.  I&apos;m a beef and fish lover and my husband loves it all.  He said that the chicken and pork were great.  I loved all the beef dishes, especially the flat steak, filet mignon, and beef ribs. The salmon was cooked perfectly.  My Grey Goose extra dirty martini was cold and delicious.  The manager heard it was our anniversary and sent over a tiramisu with candles on the house.  All </body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Chima more than a few times, and have had the same incredible experience at each and every one. From a celebratory dinner to just an indulgent night out, Chima gave me a delicious and filling meal every single time.   Before my first visit, I had never heard of the Brazilian steakhouse concept. After visiting Chima, the $50 per person price tag seems like a steal! Unlimited cuts of filet mignon, ribeye, sirloin, the list goes on and on! There are also no trade-offs here in the quality vs. quantity debate. You get the best of both worlds. Unlimited amounts of the finest meat I have ever had.   The servers can be sparse at times, keeping your water full but not much else, but they aren&apos;t who you&apos;re looking for. You&apos;re looking for the Gauchos with Skewers of meat. At peak dinner hours they&apos;re out and about and are rarely difficult to find. They&apos;re also more than willing to go and grab a buddy should you have a specific meat that you request. At less busy hours, their rounds </body>

        <body>This was my first time to the restaurant and I wasn&apos;t disappointed.   The service was great, we had two waiters that were very kind and attentive.  The menu was presented on a tablet.  It was great to use to select a glass or a bottle of wine to have with dinner as each bottle included a description and rating.  We chose a bottle of Malbec, finished it, and asked for a second bottle.  The waiter asked if he could suggest a bottle that he liked better, the same type but one that was a little sweeter and smoother.  He let us try a sample and he was spot on in his suggestion so we ordered a bottle of his recommendation.  The food was amazing.  There were plenty of choices at the salad bar.  I was surprised to see warm dishes included like rice (both white and vegetable) and beans.  I only got a few things from the salad bar because I wanted to save room for the meat.  All the meat I tried was delicious.  Our waiter (the same who suggested the wine) also suggested some different meats we </body>

        <body>I went for my birthday and loved everything except for one of the servers who gave me an attitude for not flipping my card over when I was finished eating. I didn&apos;t say anything because everyone else was so nice including the manager and are waitress. The last time I went was on New Years eve which was on my fiancé birthday with a few friends. After a while they stopped bringing over meat and we had to keep chasing the servers down and it wasn&apos;t because they were too busy. Are waiter never checked up on us and we had to keep asking the bus girl to go get him. (The bus girl was great) Had to wait extremely long for everything and It was very frustrating. Service was terrible especially when your spending over $500. I like the restaurant but I was very disappointed the last time. It is a nice place though.</body>

        <body>We went to chima for restaurant week. Granted, we were aware that the place would be busy, but boy, service was terrible. we had to ask the waitress to send over meat because no one was stopping by our table. the waitress also developed a nasty attitude when we told her we didn&apos;t want alcohol or the more expensive menu. Obviously the place was a little crazy because it was Friday night and restaurant week, but a place like chima hinges on its service and we&apos;ve been to fogo de chao under the same conditions and service was excellent. food was good, although the fish was dry and overcooked, but it doesn&apos;t make up for how bad the service was. next time we&apos;ll go to fogo de chao.</body>

Asked for little cheese bread puffs found a gal standing around, so she got both for us.  Virtually no service to speak of.  Asked an employee wiping salad bar a question, he did not speak English.  So we had salad &amp; left.  Not terrific, but stuck to my diet.</body>

        <body>Eventhough I was not seated till 30 mins after my reservation, chima was amazing. The salad bar had great veggies, melt in your mouth cantaloupe, excellent rice, fresh mozerrella, and endless dressings. There was a lot of meat options for pork, chicken, and beef lovers. I absolutely loved the steak. Also my waiter David, was pretty darn handsome and cool x). I loved my experience at chima!!!!</body>

        <body>That does not excuse the overall terrible experience that my fiance and I had last night.  We come to Chima often, and thought it would be nice to come during restaurant week.  HUGE mistake.  First, our pair of servers both came over and introduced themselves separately, and then we never saw them again for the rest of the evening.  I had to chase one of them down to get our check.  They never came to check how our food was or to see if our drinks needed to be refilled.  Second, the restaurant week menu is a complete rip off.  You get there only to be told that you can only have a few cuts of meat for restaurant week and that in order to get the other cuts, you have to pay 55.00.  What then is the point of coming during restaurant week?  Also, it was very clear that the servers were instructed to not come around as much to the restaurant week participants.  We had our cards on &quot;green&quot; most of the time that we were sitting and only were offered more meat three times.  The meat that we </body>

        <body>This is the second time that we have been unhappy with Chima and will not be returning. The last visit featured a problem with a special price that I was quoted on the phone (It was a college graduation), and improperly prepared cocktails. This visit was even worse. Although it was Restaurant Week, we were told, at tableside,  that the special pricing did not include most of the items that the kitchen offered. Even after choosing to participate in four full priced meals, the waiters serving the meat selections passed our table time and time again. I finally flagged a manager down, This resulted in one visit with filet mignon, and more waiters running by. None of our party was offered a second cocktail, though sodas were refilled. The entire experience was subpar.</body>

We were a little worried they&apos;d be too busy to have a big group but the staff was very helpful and they were able to make sure we had enough food at all times. Really great experience and the food was excellent.</body>

        <body>I must say I was highly disappointed with Chima for restaurant week. I found it to be extremely tacky that with the restaurant week menu you were only offered 10 choices of meet instead of the full menu. Restaurant week is typically a 3 course meal, at chima if you wanted dessert it was extra. The service was also lacking. We waited 10 minutes for them to come around with the next meat option. Sad to say I won&apos;t be dining at Chima again and will be heading back to Fago De Chao when I need my BriIllian Steakhouse fix.</body>

        <body>My friend and I were here during restaurant week. Arrived early, enjoyed a drink at the bar, very friendly staff, seated on time.  Server brought tasty apps, we were offered a $35 and a $55 meal. The difference is the cuts of meat. I chose $55, my friend, $35.  You don&apos;t need to spend the extra $20!  The meats on the $35 choice were much, much superior to the pricier cuts. Sirloin tastier and more tender than filet, lamb was gamey, swordfish fishy, bacon wrapped chicken dry, the best cut was flank steak!  Who would have thought?   The salad bar was spectacular with many unusual and delicious choices. Don&apos;t waste you money on dessert!  Tiramisu was dry and old, papaya was tasteless, cheesecake had cool whip instead of whipped cream, cheaters!  The espresso was delicious!  The staff was friendly, efficient, and attentive.  But, unbelievably, the ladies room only has ice cold water running from the faucets. Shame on you, Chima!  Next time We go, it will be with a big crowd. It would be l</body>

        <body>The food here was amazing. Salad bar had great selections. We went during restaurant week, so the top six cuts of meat weren&apos;t served, but the 10 that were available were still tender and flavorful. The garlic sirloin was a personal favorite. Noisier than normal, due to the larger crowd because of restaurant week. I&apos;d return for sure.</body>

        <body>So....we were super excited to go here for Valentine&apos;s Day. It was alright....the sirloin and filet were delicious. The chicken was dry and I had to ask for a specific item 5 times before someone actually showed up with it. It was nice, but the $90 a person price tag was a bit much....the only difference from the regular price was that they gave you a glass of crappy room temp champagne a silly little dessert and they took our picture. In my eyes not worth the additional $60. I would go back....but not for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>At first was a little disappointed not having full Rodizio service at lunch. The 10 oz  Sirloin did not disappoint and was served Rodizio style.  Unlimited Salad Bar was spot on with a lot of choices.  Price  for lunch was exceptional.</body>

        <body>The food was delightful. All the meats were delicious. If we hadn&apos;t tasted one and told the waiter, moments later the food was arriving at our table. The service was impeccable! We didn&apos;t have to wait long for anything. The wait staff was attentive and speedy. We had a wonderful time.</body>

        <body>I recently visited Chimas to celebrate my wife&apos;s birthday. It was a great experience.  We both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Chimas is truly a fine dining experience.  My wife was even presented with a tiramisu and a candle for her birthday.  I highly recommend Chimas.</body>

        <body>This was our second time to chima. The first time was not during restaurant week but was still busy. We probably had people at our table trying to give us different meats 2 and 3 at a time most times. During restaurant week, we were lucky to see each meat let alone see it a second time. Our favorite meats we only had offered once. Our waitress even asked what meat we would like sent over and asked the temp we preferred but they never came. when making my reservation I noted that we were coming for my boyfriends birthday and nothing was done for him. Not even a happy birthday. I have worked in the restaurant business for a long time. I am not one that says it someone&apos;s birthday to get anything for free. But it was his birthday, the exact day and to have nothing be done was disappointing.</body>

        <body>Went for a very early dinner on a Sunday night during restaurant week and had a fantastic meal. The service was great, even with the restaurant packed with other deal-seekers. Waiters were very attentive, checking in regularly to take away plates, ask if there were meats we&apos;d like more of, etc. I loved the &quot;salad bar&quot; too - a great selection of food, with ready-made salads and ingredients to put together tasty ones, plus delicious rice, soup... And the main draw: the meats. The sirloin was the best - cooked just right, with the taste of the meat shining through. We were very happy with the meal, though I&apos;m not sure if we&apos;d go back during regular pricing except for a special occasion. There are some nice non-alcoholic drink options, not on the menu - it&apos;s worth asking if you&apos;re interested.</body>

        <body>Dining at Chimas was a great experience.  My wife and I enjoyed our anniversary dinner here and we had a wonderful time. The food was very tasteful and well prepared. only drawback was limited sides for entrée and waiters are not that attentive. I had to wait for someone to fill my glass of water for over a half hour and the place was almost empty.</body>

        <body>Pleasantly surprised by the seating, number of servers and the exceptional salad bar!  It was our first visit which was recommended by my niece.  We didn&apos;t get to sample any of the higher end meats like the rib-eye, lamb chops or filet mignon .  Because it was restaurant week they offered two different menus at two price levels.   That was disappointing.  The service was slow but the extra supervisory staff helped to move the the servers along. Overall we will revisit because we did leave content.  So, it was a different dinning experience.</body>

        <body>My husband and I decided to dine here for NYE.  I made a reservation with Open Table for 6:30pm, but later changed it to 7:00pm.  When we arrived at 7, the hostess tried to inform me that my reservation was for 6:15pm.  Needless to say, the mistake was on their end as someone ended up resetting my reservation without my knowledge, but that didn&apos;t stop the hostess from being rude and blaming me for the error.  In any case, we were eventually seated.  The salad bar was delicious and the servers kept it well stocked during this busy dinner service.  When we first started accepting dinner service by turning over our little cards to let the servers know, the food was flowing for a bit.  After a while, it seemed like food wasn&apos;t coming around as frequently.  We did make a special request to have one particular meat brought to our table and waited nearly 15 minutes before it actually came.  I&apos;ve been to this restaurant several times and have never experienced this kind of trouble with dinner</body>

        <body>We were here on a Sunday evening. It wasn&apos;t that busy at all. We were seated right away. After we were sat and given menu, our wait staff introduced themselves. I thought, wow 3 servers? That is awesome.  Well not exactly, I had to ask for clean ayes for our table numerous times because they were too busy chatting with each other right behind us. I also had to ask numerous times for drink refills.  Food was ok. Filet was never brought around even when we asked twice about it and were billed how much money for it. Very disappointing. Won&apos;t be back.</body>

        <body>A cavernous restaurant with lots of activity. Great salad bar that goes well beyond salad.  The star attraction is the wide selection of meats that gaucho costumed servers bring to your table.  They don&apos;t, however, come all that frequently and there are more offerings of the cheaper cuts, sausages and chicken, than the better cuts.  We had to ask for the lamb which was never offered us.  A manager comes by to ask if you&apos;ve been served everything you desire which is a nice consideration.  The meats are absolutely stellar!  They are tender and seasoned wonderfully!</body>

        <body>Me and my boyfriend went last year for Valentines day. It was his first time and my second going to this location. The service was great. The waitress and the busser were niece and stayed on top of our needs. Overall out experience was great! After a good year last year we decided to try it again this year. This time was nothing like last time. We we&apos;re say in the back next to the bar and basically forgot about. Our waiter was too busy making conversation with another table and neglected his job as a waiter. Meat was brought around slowly then eventually stopped altogether. We were left with empty plates. Not only us but the other couples that we&apos;re stashed back there as well. Even after a few complaints the service didn&apos;t get any better. By the end of our night, we were unsatisfied about everything. Last year the prices were $80 a person, when you were finished your meal there were 3 dessert choices to choose from. This year prices were $89 a person and they gave everyone the same de</body>

        <body>We have been to Chima&apos;s several times however this was our worst experience. We waited a while for the servers to come around with the meat. One server circled our table several times and as we tried to get his attention after stopping that one time he still skipped over our table. We have never in the past sat there waiting for anyone to walk by and offer us something. There were several types of meats that only circled our area once and when the waitress asked if we would like any special type of meat it never made it to our table anyway. We always raved about Chima&apos;s to our son and after taking him with us this time he was not impressed and neither were we this time. For the price, this trip was defiantly NOT worth it to us.</body>

        <body>This was my 3rd visit to Chima&apos;s. However, this is my first time coming  in for lunch. The food was plentiful but some of the meats were fatty.  I will eat at this restaurant again but will visit during the dinner hour.</body>

        <body>We have dined at Chima frequently, and just returned from an evening there during restaurant week. Never again. Firstly, if you want the entire selection of meats, you must pay extra ($59 instead of the $35 restaurant week price). I think we may have seen 6 cuts of meat during our visit, instead of the 15 promised.  The meat was sub par, definitely not as good as it once was - bland, tough and just all around not good. And, we were seated directly in front of the door to the kitchen where we listened to the staff yell &quot;corner!&quot; and &quot;out!&quot; as they went in and out of the kitchen the entire evening.   The one bright spot was Tod our server. He was excellent.  Other than that, there is no reason for us to return to Chima, and we will not. When we want our Brazilian steakhouse fix, we will be heading to Fogo from now on.</body>

        <body>The salad bar is fantastic - It has such a large variety of  delicious salads &amp; fresh vegetables. The meats are delicious  and  I like that there are at least 2 fish choices. I also love the Brazilian Cream Soda Drink. We went on Thanksgiving &amp; a full Thanksgiving dinner was also being served. The wait staff, as well as the Maitre&apos;D are very accommodating &amp; friendly. The energy in the room was great! I also like that patrons are offered discounted parking at a lot nearby. Even though I hate driving downtown, I visit Chima at least twice a year, and I always recommend it to friends. My only complaint is that the ladies room is small &amp; not well ventilated.</body>

        <body>We went to Chima specifically for the discounted price during restaurant week.  When we sat down at the table, the server asked if we were there for restaurant week.  When we replied yes, we were told that the restaurant week price DOES NOT include the top 4 cuts of meat.  No filet, filet wrapped in bacon or two types of top sirloin.  We were then given the option to &quot;upgrade&quot; to the full menu for $54.95.  If I wanted to spend $54.95 I would go when it&apos;s not restaurant week.  There was only 2 cuts of beef available...and they came around very infrequently all while the 4 cuts of meat that were not included paraded by constantly.  3 out of the 4 people in our party were sick about 6 hours later as well.  The one person who was not sick is the only one who didn&apos;t eat the sausage.   It wasn&apos;t all bad, though.  The service was great.  Our waiter was on point w/ our drinks &amp; water refills as well as checking to make sure everything was okay.  When we asked for the two cuts of meat that wer</body>

        <body>I have eaten at Chima&apos;s many times and every time (even during restaurant week) the services is impeccable, however, this time not so much.  The wait staff and food was great as usually.  I unfortunately cannot say the same about my wait to be seated.  I visited on a Tuesday night and had a rsvp for 7:15pm and was not seated until 8:15pm.  I thought the whole purpose of rsvp is so I would not have to wait the same amount of time I would have to wait without a rsvp.  The hostess was very apologetic and made efforts to get me seated as fast as she can (she even cleaned and set the table), which is why my rating wasn&apos;t lower than a 3.  I know it was restaurant week, but as mentioned earlier, I have been to Chima&apos;s on restaurant week and never had this issue.  I would definitely back, but I expect better.</body>

        <body>Chima was a great experience from the moment we walked through the doors until we left.  The hostesses were very friendly and personable, and they were able to have our table ready a little earlier than the reservation.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and answered any questions we had.  The salad bar was nice, but the variety of meats is the real reason we went.  Everything was great, but we both agree that the salmon was the best thing we had that night.  Definitely not what we expected from Chima, but we were pleasantly surprised.  Expect to spend a good amount of money if you don&apos;t go during restaurant week, but it is worth it for special occasions.</body>

        <body>It is very over priced.  The food is just ok a bit to salty.  I was looking forward to the fish portion but it was grossly over cooked.  For the price I have no urge to go again.  I would rather go to a high end resturant, not a hi end buffet.  Service wasn&apos;t terrible except we waited an hour for our check.</body>

        <body>Everything was so delicious! Wait staff was very knowledgable and pleasant. The only thing I have to complain about is that it took a long time for our table to get meat. By the time we finally flagged someone down with ribs, we had mostly finished eating. I felt like we had to get their attention for them to stop otherwise they just asked right by us. Salad bar is super delicious. Overall it was wonderful and I would definitely go back!</body>

        <body>the food was good and the service was so good. The only problem was that I had to wait an additional 40 minutes past my reservation time due to the restaurant week special that I did not know how about. I think that this experience would have been better if it was not a restaurant week.</body>

        <body>Wasn&apos;t sure what to expect, as it was chosen by my 16 year old son, but found it to be very nice. The inside has a very nice and elegant ambiance. The &quot;salad bar&quot; is so much more than that and not only beautifully presented but very well attended to. Then, of course, then notion that when your little table chip is flipped orange a roving band of servers will come by and offer you various meats, lamb, chicken, and even fish for as long as you care to eat...well, what can be wrong with that The meat was all expertly grilled and spiced(I loved the various rib-eyes the most). Not sure it is right for not meat eaters (my son did a couple of rounds of fish), but really great food, ambiance and service.  Perhaps as to be expected, it was VERY expensive ($148 for two of us, that included one soda, two big bottles of Perrier, and one dessert with a 20% tip). I&apos;ll go back for a special request on my son&apos;s part, but, you really have to bring an appetite to swallow the price.  We did!</body>

        <body>What a great place to come for restaurant week! You have unlimited salad bar, sides, and let&apos;s not forget about the delicious meat for a price that is much less than if you came on a normal evening.   Thinking about the amazing meal that my friends and I were going to enjoy, I made reservations for this past restaurant week. At that time I could not recall why I vowed to never come during restaurant week again until we arrived for our reservation. This made for the second time that my party did not get sat until 2 hours after our reservation time. Why should I even make reservations? Clearly the restaurant is making more reservations than it can accommodate for and it made for a terrible experience. If I make reservations to eat at 8:00pm, I don&apos;t want to be sitting down at 10:00pm for a huge meal. By that time I&apos;m angry, hungry, and can&apos;t even enjoy the delicious meal I was so looking forward to.</body>

        <body>The protein sweats we experienced were well earned - our group ate more steaks and lamb chops than a small village.  The service got a little slow towards the end - their way of hinting at us to wrap it up which is a bit annoying.  Hey Chimas - we&apos;re power lifters and we eat a lot.  So don&apos;t worry, you won&apos;t go broke just keep bringing the food over here.  We&apos;ll let you know when we&apos;re done.    Then we went to get our car - which was valet parked (free that evening).  Complete disaster - they messed up the keys, didn&apos;t know which key was associated with which ticket.  They took well over 30 minutes to find the car.  Absolutely destroyed the mood we were in - happyness turned to irritation to anger.    Overall experience on a 1-10 scale, 6.</body>

        <body>We usually try to go to Chima once a month.  When we went this pat Saturday, the service was so horrible, we don&apos;t know if we would be returning anytime soon.   It took about ten minutes to get drinks and when we asked for some more fried polenta, she never returned with it.  When we asked again for more polenta, it took another 20 mins to get some.  The waitress was too interested with the table that was behind us and spent a majority of her time with them.  It looks like we will be making our monthly trip to Fogo instead.</body>

        <body>I took my family here because I heard from friends how good the food is and how the service was great and I have to say it didn&apos;t disappoint. I had a party of 8 and the place was packed with at least 4 other big parties and I loved the attention we received from the staff. The meat kept following and our request for specific items were meant right away with minimal waiting.  This place is great, the only warning I would give is unless you have kids that really like different meat choices or are willing to try different items or just really like salad bars get a sitter and leave them home and enjoy a nice night out with other adults.</body>

        <body>I loved Chima,  Let me say that again LOVED.  I have been going to Chima for years.  The experiences each time we go has been getting worse and worse.  Last night was the worst and the last time i will spend my money there.   I had to keep getting up and putting my used plates on a busser station, i went to the kitchen asking for certain things.  We sat for 1 hour before any meat came to our table. (yes our cards were on green)    For restaurant week Chima has also lowered their menu.  No more filet or filet wrapped in bacon. :(  This is not good business. For as busy as they are b/c of restaurant week you think they would offer their entire menu.  not at an additional price.  Also had to keep waiting on clean plates.  The server came to our table in the beginning and to give us our check nothing else.  WORSE  experience ever.</body>

        <body>The food was great and the table service was wonderful. The only thing I had a problem with was the reception. We had a reservation for five people and our fifth person was running behind. We were told we couldn&apos;t be seated until the fifth person got there because they didn&apos;t want to seat us at a table for five if the fifth person didn&apos;t show. I was irritated because majority of the party was there so I didn&apos;t see what the problem was. Our fifth ultimately arrived after about 20 minutes and They seated us at a table for 6 which put the icing on the cake because what difference would it make if they would have seated the four of us on time and we had an extra seat when we ended up with an extra setting anyway. Tell your hostesses to think about it the next time</body>

        <body>This was the first time I was disappointed with the service at Chima.. It was disappointed cause I bregged about this place, to a friend that&apos;s never been. I don&apos;t agree with the chicken being wrapped in bacon &amp; the non wrapped never came out.  Guests it was just one of those nights. I still will go &amp; recommend I had more good times then ok times</body>

        <body>The food was to die for! First the salad bar was the best one I&apos;ve ever been to! Such different amazing options and my favorite was the vegetable rice! Then there were the amazing sides like the fried banana and creamy mashed potatoes YUMMM! And by this time I was already so full but the meat service was amazing. Parmesan crusted chicken, sirloin, salmon, and the bacon wrapped chicken were my personal favorites, I&apos;m a college student and getting to experience that for 35 dollars during restaurant week was a really amazing experience! Can&apos;t wait for the day when I can afford to there often!</body>

        <body>Had great potential-but missed the mark. Service started out strong with frequent visits from the gauchos. Great selection, variety and amazing salad bar. Then...it just stopped! No service, we waited forever. Manager came over-asked what we needed-and nothing! Waitress stopped by-again took our request-again Nothing! How does that happen? Perhaps because they had several large parties, it was a Friday night at 7pm-but still. We spent several hundred dollars and left HUNGRY! So disappointed.</body>

        <body>For our six year anniversary, my girlfriend wanted to try this place out.  We&apos;re reservations and arrived timely. On arrival we were promptly greeted by the host staff and seated. Our servers came over to introduced themselves and explain how everything works. We&apos;ve been to fogo de chao before so we kinda knew our the Brazilian steak house worked.    The food was excellent, especially the lamb chops, I tried all the meats including the salmon and hands down the lamb chops took the cake!  The atmosphere here was very casual but in a. Ice kinda fancy way.  Overall we had a very pleasant experience! We loved the food, the service was attentive and the atmosphere was nice! My girlfriend said we needed to come back again lol. Totally recommend this place for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>A repeat visit. The salad bar, if you must, has a tremendous variety and numerous choices. Very, very good. But the reason to visit a steakhouse is for the meat. The garlic steak was to die for, with the sirloin and flank not far behind. The swordfish and salmon also very good. Only option that was not up to 5 star eating was bacon wrapped chicken,  which was dry. The martinis, while good, were no better or worse than those at many other establishments.  All in all, wirth a visit, especially during Center City Restaurant Week.</body>

        <body>Food was good Service wasn&apos;t good not all the waiters came to your table or they would come offer to 2 people then walk away when it&apos;s 6 at the table and the Manager came to our table to see if you would like a certain meat and we let her know what we wanted and she inturn told us okay I will go get them and we never seen the manager again and that meat we wanted. And in the past for resturant week you were able to get all the meat for the $35 price now your only allowed a select few to eat or spend $54 to get the entire meat selection.</body>

        <body>This was my first time at China and I must say I had a great experience! The waiter was friendly and helpful, he walked me through the entire drink list and set up. The food was  delicious! A vast selection from the salad bar, and the meat selection was PERFECT!!! Try the  Lamb chops and Brisket falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. I  would go back soon! Thank you for a great experience</body>

        <body>The service was slow. It took 45 minutes to get seated and no one came to our table for what seemed like 5 minutes. We finally got plates and the meats took a while to start making it to our table. More servers were needed.   The food was good, not great. Some of the pork was tough.</body>

        <body>Good steaks.  Good service.  alad bar wasn&apos;t quite the best. Waiter and waitress forget to bring us fries bananas after asking 3 xs.  I was told sangria pitcher was 24.00 and was charged 34.00.   I think Fogo de chau charge less.</body>

        <body>Went for Restaurant Week.  Ordered from the RW menu instead of the normal menu and was treated like a second class citizen.  Asked 5x&apos;s for steak before the finally brought some to the table.  Kept trying to fill us up on chicken, pork and sausage.  Had to ask several times for a refill on water.  Took 20 minutes to take the credit card after we received the check.  Fogo de Chao is 1000% better than this place.  Will not be back EVER!!!</body>

        <body>I eat at Chima about 4-6 times a year with my 2 small kids (now 8 &amp; 9) and my vegetarian wife. Almost every time, even after I remind them, they try to charge for full 2-4 Rodizio, instead of 1 Full, 1 Vegetarian and 2 kids. It then takes then 20 minutes to fix the bill.  The last time was at Easter brunch and my kids were fully face painted and holding balloons, just  in case they thought they were tiny adults and not children.   It really ends the meal in a bad way and keeps me from coming back more often, because really who needs this hassle.  I wish the management would dissuade this &quot;upcharging&quot; as I am sure I am not the only one it happens to since it happens almost every time I have been there for the past 5 years.</body>

        <body>We have brought friends, colleagues and clients to Chima Philadelphia several times every year since the location opened. We always love the food, but the service last night was disappointing. Yes, the restaurant was very busy, but I mentioned when I made the reservation on OpenTable that we were celebrating a birthday, and gave descriptive information for the woman whose birthday it was. The hostess even quietly confirmed this with me as she seated us, and confirmed that it was a surprise.   After we finished dinner, we ordered 3 desserts to share among 4 people, plus coffee. The waiter brought 2 of the desserts, and said that the other dessert was being prepared. I assumed that this was a bit of a ruse to gather the staff to sing Happy Birthday in Portuguese, as they had done at other tables throughout the evening. But when the waiter brought the last dessert, he also brought the check! So no one (except us) wished our guest a happy birthday!   If he had just brought the last desser</body>

        <body>We went during restaurant week. It seemed like it was random chance when the carvers would come to our table. We had to request them several times to different waiters/waitress before one would come over to our table. We were also told if we parked in a certain parking lot we would receive $8.00 parking ours was $10 dollars and you had to use a charge card.(very disappointed).</body>

        <body>This was our 3rd time visiting Chima and we were not disappointed.  We arrived early for our reservation so our table wasn&apos;t ready yet.  We were able to sit near the bar and have a glass of wine, which was nice because too often your stuck standing or can&apos;t get to the bar.  The wine list was pretty extensive and was presented on an iPad where you could select a wine and learn more about it if you weren&apos;t familiar with the name.  Our table was ready on time and I&apos;ll say, having a reservation is a must as the amount of people waiting started to build when we sat down.  There were a couple of large parties and the restaurant had no problem taking care of them and us.  The servers were attentive and there was always good on our table.  Make sure you try a little of everything, you never know when something will surprise you.  There is a pretty good salad bar too and they brought fried banana, plantains and mashed potatoes, as well as small rolls to the table.  This all you can eat is leap</body>

        <body>We tried Chima on a Friday night to celebrate my wife&apos;s completing her masters degree. We had a relatively early reservation, 7:30, and when we first arrived the restaurant was quiet, but as the evening wore on, it became louder as the restaurant became busier with larger parties. Also, when we first began our meal, the servers who bring the meats around seemed more frequent than later on in the evening when the restaurant got busier. Other than those few small things, our meal was amazing. There was a wide selection of meats to try, in addition to the vast options on the salad bar and the bread, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas they bring to your table. Also, they will keep bringing those bread and mashed potatoes and other items to your table if you ask. We were too full for dessert, but we plan to go back another time to just try the many dessert options. As all we got was the salad, meats, and the complimentary table options, we drank tap water, and didn&apos;t get dessert, our bill </body>

        <body>You&apos;ll only need to eat at  Chima once to become a huge fan of this place.  The house drink (a lime/rum concoction, the name of which I can never  remember nor pronounce) is heavenly.  I usually have to stop myself from having a third...and I&apos;m not always successful (which can be a problem because it&apos;s mostly rum, but incredibly smooth and sweet.)  &quot;Salad&quot; bar is generously stocked with delicious and very fresh salami, prosciutto, cheeses, seafoods, pastas, and soups.  Save room for the cooked meats, though...they are varied, flavorful and cooked to perfection, and they won&apos;t try to stop feeding you until you darn near bust.  Food is about $50 fixed: rather a bargain.  Careful: this place is lots of fun and somewhat addictive!</body>

        <body>I made a reservation. We were seated 15 minutes later, in the doorway. We were moved eventually. I was looking forward to our dinner here.  The meat is so over seasoned that it is hard to move from one tasting to another because your still have a bacon or garlic. We were offered sausage 4 times but had to ask for lamb chops at the end of the meal. They were rancid and left a horrible taste in my mouth.  Fried bananas, Fried corn meal and Watery mashed potatoes were left on our table 3/4 of the way through our meal. Our bill exceeded the stated amount for dinner. I didn&apos;t even bother at that point.  It felt like a buffet. The servers were polite and gracious. Total disappointment.</body>

        <body>It is a nice enough place... go hungry. The spread is nice. There are meats and fish that you do not get from their competitor.</body>

        <body>This was our second time to Chima.  The first was a much better experience.  Our reservation was for 8:15.  We weren&apos;t seated until after 9.  I honestly think that is the longest I have ever waited for a reservation anywhere, and we were originally told they were about 15 minutes behind, and advised us to get a drink at the bar while we were waiting.  Of course, that estimate was far from accurate.  When we were finally seated, I was surprised that there was no offering of, at minimum, a complimentary drink or dessert.  The food was good, and the service was friendly, albeit erratic, but it just wasn&apos;t a great experience overall.  I know that this was during restaurant week, but there is no reason that there shouldn&apos;t be the same expectations of an excellent experience, just because it is at a discounted price.  I think that there definitely was a problem with overbooking the reservations too, which added to the problem.  We were packed in so tight that I couldn&apos;t hear the people sitt</body>

        <body>Made a reservation for 8:30, was 15 minutes late, but called in advance to warn them of our tardiness, was not seated for an hour (around 9:45 pm). The server was nice but you could tell she was overworked/ they were understaffed. Also, the restroom was very dirty when we arrived, out of toilet paper, trash overflowing, etc. By the end of the meal, someone had been in there to clean up but it was about 1.5 hours later.</body>

        <body>Everything ordered seemed like it was reheated or served from the refrigerator.  Bisque was not fresh. Wedge Salad was ice cold and bacon on top was hard and inedible. Lobster mash was reheated in microwave and was a gluey mess. For the cost, this all should have been better. Service was nice but they should have noticed how poor it all seemed.it was early dinner hour and things should have been fresh.</body>

        <body>The waitstaff is attentive and my waiter gave good recommendations on their seafood orders. Their NYC Restaurant Week menu has a lot of seafood selections, which is great for the $25. I had the Pt Judith calamari, which was delicious - not heavily breaded which I prefer. I order their lobster roll, which was good too but it was smaller in size that expected (I have eaten at Luke&apos;s Lobster a few times and their rolls were almost half bigger.). It seemed like more an appetizer than main course. Ton of fries on the size; maybe too much. Plus to pay extra for having it was kind of disappointment, just for that size alone. The Key Lime Pie was excellent, just enough tang!</body>

        <body>I started off with the seafood clam chowder and it was under seasoned, therefore I didn&apos;t enjoy it at all. The lobster that was my entree wasn&apos;t much to be desired. This pre-fix menu for nyc restaurant week included no sides. And was very limited choices. But I must say the servers were very fast and courteous. And the creme brûlée cheesecake was my favorite!  Overall I would give this restaurant and 3 on the scale of 1 to 10.</body>

        <body>Very nice ambience with good prices.  I was disappointed in the cioppino which was rather bland and served with linguini, a 1st in my experience.  My daughter&apos;s filet mignon was very good however.  The value was notable compared to other similar restaurants.  I&apos;d be willing to try other items on the menu.  It was w/in walking distance of The Rockefeller Center.</body>

        <body>We have fond memories of coming here before going to a show, the food was expensive but excellent, and we couldn&apos;t believe our luck with the oyster Happy Hour deal. The oysters were fantastic and we decided we could probably go back just to eat the oysters every week if we lived close enough. Spring for the lobster, even though borderline overpriced, worth it.</body>

        <body>For a restaurant to have lobster in the name I expected more lobster. Food was great, our server was boring!  Would come back at night to try the larger menu.</body>

        <body>If you enjoy fish, this is the place.  Reasonable prices for mid-town and a nice prix fixe menu.  We enjoyed oysters Rockefeller, calamari, lobster, and filet of sole plus desserts of key lime pie and chocolate pecan pie.  The food was all nicely prepared and the service was  excellent.  It&apos;s location right off Sixth Avenue makes it a little less hectic than many Theater District restaurants closer to Broadway and Eighth.   It was a lovely dinner after the fun show at Radio City.</body>

        <body>Fresh oysters were great!  Lobster chowder also was terrific.  Entrees of Chilean Sea Bass and Delaware striped bass were very good.  Service was outstanding.  Draft beer selection was limited but, I thought, nice - - Delirium Tremens was available and as always for me was delicious.  Wine list was extensive.</body>

        <body>One of few places that belie es you don&apos;t have to remove a plate from a table until everyone at the table is finished eating their dinner.  Places less pressure on a slow eater and allows the diners to enjoy their dinner.  They of course will remove on request.  Great pre-theatre menu.  Pricey but well worth it.  We will come back every time we are in town (once or twice a year).  Thank you!</body>

        <body>This was a last minute thing and made a reso 1 week prior....from the moment we walked in we were greeted by Inga, what a wonderful hostess! I can&apos;t say enough about her lovely personality ...the rest was just as great to follow. Alexander was our server, he was amazing, very professional and pleasant...the food was spectacular, the seafood tower delish! I had the King crab and we also had Surf and Turf....even the crème brulee was perfect!</body>

        <body>I thoroughly enoyed my experience at City Lobster.  The food and service was excellent.  The restaurant was busy, but not over crowded.  We were 15 minutes early but were still seated right away.  The lighting is bright, making it easy to see the menu and your food.  Portions are large so you definitely get your money&apos;s worth.  The only draw back to this experience was they they didn&apos;t have any gluten free bread options.  The bread and butter served are the best I&apos;ve had anywhere.  I was sad that I couldn&apos;t really induldge due to my gluten allergy.  Dangerous I know, but I only had one bite.  :)</body>

        <body>As a &quot;Seafood&quot; restaurant, they offered a very nice list of seafood options unlike some other restaurants.  My girlfriend enjoys seafood but I&apos;m allergic to it so it was nice to go to a place that gave her what she wanted and enjoyed but still gave me something that I too could enjoy.</body>

        <body>Love, love, love City Lobster! I first went 5 years ago to celebrate a milestone in my daughters education and career.  We have both gone back every year. The menu is fabulously varied and scrumptious! From the greeter, the hostess, the server to the bus help, you are always met with a smile and the very best service to make your visit spectacular! I cannot possibly recommend this restaurant more and will continue to visit and celebrate there with my family and friends!</body>

        <body>This is only my second time visiting City Lobster and I think it is a great spot to stop by for lunch or dinner before a show.  It was a Saturday afternoon so it wasn&apos;t crowded.   I was happy to see that they were still offering The Restaurant Week menu, which was reasonably priced and offered nice choices.  We both had the blue cheese wedge salad and I had the lobster roll and my friend had the crab cake as our entrees and both were very good.  Desserts were good also.  Waiter was a little abrupt with his responses but got more friendly as the meal went on, guess he was looking for a good tip.  I asked for salt for my fries and they literally put the whole box of salt on the table instead of a salt shaker, which restaurant doesn&apos;t have salt and pepper on the table.  I did also find a small shell in my lobster roll.  On the whole City Lobster is a great place to eat.</body>

        <body>I ordered the &quot;Baked Mid-Atlantic Oysters and Crabmeat Rockefeller&quot; for appetizer and this tasted nothing out of the ordinary. For entrée, I had the &quot;Steamed Prince Edward Island Mussels&quot; (lobster broth, shaved fennel, orange zest and fresh herbs with housemade fries) and this was a huge disappointment! It was nowhere compared to the mussels I had at Steak Frites. As for dessert, I chose the &quot;Profiteroles Arabica&quot; (coffee ice-cream and a dense chocolate-espresso sauce). It was served very frozen and definitely not the best I had.   Their service leaves much to be desired! The staff hurried us through our meals and served our entrée while we were still having our appetizer. Thus, by the time I had the mussels, it was cold.  Overall, there is plenty of room for improvement!</body>

        <body>We had no idea what to expect when we went to City Lobster for a pre-show lunch.  What a wonderful surprise!  The wait staff were pleasant and knowledgeable.  The decor was beautiful and the food was just the best seafood I&apos;ve ever had.  This is definitely going to be a restaurant that I choose when I go to the city now.  My absolute favorite!</body>

        <body>The food wasn&apos;t great. We did restaurant week and the mussel appetizer was bland and not flavorful at all. The risotto that came with the entree was undercooked. Additionally, the hostess was talking so loud to her coworker right in front of us about how we need to leave and that she needs to set the table for a party of five which was rude. The ambiance and decor wasn&apos;t that nice and felt a little outdated.</body>

        <body>I arrived on time for my reservation and was told that I needed to wait to be seated (understandable because it was a Friday night during restaurant week), and after 30 minutes of waiting the host who was checking every one told me I was going to get a nice booth for me and my date and we got excited (lame, I know lol). But the second host walked us over to a table instead and when I asked her why weren&apos;t we seated for a booth she replied that It was not requested in our reservation. I was sold a dream that did not come true :&apos;( Our server was a really nice older man who smiled every time he passed our table. But I was really disappointed in the food :( I don&apos;t know if it was because the influx of people coming in for restaurant week that might&apos;ve brought down the food quality but I had high exceptions for this place. The fried calamari was mediocre. I liked the nice spicy kick it had but the coating wasn&apos;t very appetizing or crispy,  The &quot;jumbo&quot; scallops were the size of a dollar coi</body>

        <body>There was a full lunch  crown when we arrived at the restaurant.  The food was as good as previously experienced.  Because of the recent super cold weather during restaurant week it was good  to see the special menu was still being offered.   Service  was efficient  yet gracious;  it was  timely but not rushed.   I will be returning with other friends.</body>

        <body>Although the calamari and Oysters Rockefeller appetizers were good, the main course sole was mushy (obviously thawed from a frozen state) and the lobster bits accompanying it were rubbery and overdone.  I was tempted to return it and order another dish, but we had a later appointment.  This visit was very disappointing after two previous successful Restaurant Week dining experiences.  My husband and I were looking for a good restaurant near the theater district to return to in the future, but I would not consider this restaurant even though we received attentive service.</body>

        <body>A very average experience.  For some reason, it seems that this restaurant struggles to get it right.  I have eaten here before, and it is a fine choice for reasonably priced seafood in midtown.  It just lacks something.  Service is slightly below average.</body>

        <body>I was very ecstatic and looking forward to going with 3 of my friends. Waitress was very nice and friendly. My salmon was way undercooked but waitress was very kind and had it cooked a bit more. We did restaurant week but food was too much for us so we had alot of left overs. It didnt taste goid enough to pack it home. Calamari, oyster rockefeller, Crab cake n fries were good. I liked my Salmon but felt the portion was really small. We werent too crazy about Lobster roll and fish n chips. Key lime pie was wayy too sour but profiteroles were the best. The worst part was getting food poisoned. I thought its just me but another friend if mine whos pregnant had it worse than me:( Overall experience was ok, great service but food quality needs to improve.</body>

        <body>we took advantage of the restaurant week prefix lunch menu and I am so glad we did! The service was impeccable, quiet and serene environment conducive to a romantic meal.  The seafood was incredibly fresh and cooked to perfection and the dessert serving didn&apos;t leave me feeling guilty about indulging in the treat! We will definitely be returning</body>

        <body>This was our first trip to City Lobster and while we would go back again, we would be prepared to be there a while and not expect much in the line of fast service.  We had to ask more than once for ice tea refills, and the table next to us had to ask for forks!!!  The food was good although the lobster roll was a bit of a disappointment.  The Angry Lobster (recommended by our server) was tasty and a lot of work, and we weren&apos;t offered a hot towel until after a trip to the restroom to wash up.  A bit less than what we expected.</body>

        <body>Enjoyed our dinner here very much - food was really great - I had the filet of sole - fantastic topping with lobster in it.  Very nice prix fix menu although we didn&apos;t get it because we knew we didn&apos;t want dessert.  Service very good - easy location - ambiance simple but stylish.  Even love the Frank Sinatra playing in the restroom!  Diners were a varied mix, a group of business men, a family with children (fried chicken and fries looked fantastic), 2 girlfriends out for a early dinner.  My husband and I were dining pre theater.  Value was good as well.</body>

        <body>We had been to City Lobster before and liked it. this time was not as good.  I ordered scallops and the plate came with 3.  I suspect that&apos;s because i ordered a restaurant week fixed price dinner, so they may have skimped on the entree.  But the food was good.  My wife, on the other hand, ordered a petit fillet mignon that was simply not edible (real lousy piece of meat).  Theu made goo on a different dinner for her, but by then, we ended up eating separately.  Hey,  will try a different spot next time, that&apos;s all.</body>

        <body>Horrible manager. It took 55 minutes to get our dinner after we ordered. Obviouslya problem. Three times i asked for manager and he walked by us twice without ever talking to me. In fact he never spoke to me at all. Terrible dining experience.</body>

        <body>I went there for restaurant week with my friend. We had clam chowder for appetizer. We had salmon and crab cake for entree. The crab cake doesn&apos;t taste right. I had key lime pie which was too sour. My friend had the pecan pie which is too sweet. We only tasted two bites of it and we gave up.</body>

        <body>Upon arrival, check in for immediate seating.  I regret that at this visit no bread was put on our able. I was there the day before for lunch and the bread basket was brought to the table in a expedited fashion.  We participated in the restaurant week dinner menu and the appetizer was hot but not too hot to savor the clam chowder.</body>

        <body>Our lunches were superb and the restaurant offered oysters on the half shell at $1.00 apiece. In addition to our lunches, we ordered two dozen oysters besides.  The place was crowded, but the noise level was not excessive and we had excellent service, The three of us had filet of sole decorated with lobster chunks  and a fine sauce.  Altogether  a fine experience.</body>

        <body>I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant. Unfortunately bad service, a MOUSE running around ruining the appetites of my table and the couple across from us, and an manager with lack of experience and customer care cut our dinner short and left me regretting my dining choice. The waitress was overwhelmed from the start(even though it was pretty dead in there at 9:30pm on a Tuesday) and when ordering asked me to wait and she will have to come back. Then they were out of the appetizer we ordered...she came back five minutes later to let us know. Then the second app wasn&apos;t doable so we opted for a third, the dumplings. They were ok. From then it didn&apos;t get any better. Lol  I was shocked that we were even expected to pay for the tiny bit of salad and appetizer after jumping up in the beginning of our entree due to the rodent running under us. The couple across from us got up and left without blinking an eye when the mouse came at then. We should have done the same. We left an</body>

        <body>My daughter and I went here for Restaurant Week for a small celebration.  The service was impeccable--I never had a dirty plate (or an empty one, for that matter) or an empty drink.  The food was great--and a wide selection, which many restaurants don&apos;t offer for Restaurant Week.  This is why we &quot;tried&quot; it.  We will definitely be back, Restaurant Week or no.</body>

        <body>Overall, the experience was good. The food was as expected; the lobster was delicious but the bisque was watery. Two things that were negative were 1) the prix fixe for the main lobster was misleading. It only said an extra $16 but really it was more if you got a special seasoned lobster, e.g. angry lobster. 2) One of the hostesses was the worst! She was an older woman, gray-reddish hair, a smoker. We had a reservation for 7:30pm. We arrived at 7:05 and told her we were there early. She told us to wait at the bar to be called. We did. at 7:35pm no one had called us so my bf inquired and she damn near chewed his face off by claiming that we were late. When he reminded her that we had already checked in with her, she told us to wait a minute. That turned into 5 minutes. So I approached her and she had more attitude. We were finally seated at 7:50pm with no apology. She almost ruined our experience. However, the other hostess and our waiter Diego (both Brazilian, not that that matters) w</body>

The scallops were delicious, however the salmon tasted a bit funny, we told the server and she was polite and gave us another entree instead.  For dessert, we had the fruits with sabayon along with the pecan pie, both were delicious.  I&apos;d come again but they are very busy, so make reservations.</body>

        <body>City Lobster has very good food and exceptional service. I&apos;m not sure it measures up with the adjacent Del Frisco&apos;s in terms of having a balance between amazing service and great food. However, the midtown location and the service is noteworthy in an era of smug and trendy restaurants that aren&apos;t known for either of those characteristics.  City Lobster doesn&apos;t try to get too crazy with their creations but they do try without alienating traditionalists and the midtown expense account brigade.</body>

        <body>We were both pleased with the number of options on the menu and enjoyed our dinner. However it took 15 minutes to find a table for us even though we had reservations. Two couples who walked in after us were seated before we were. Service was a bit slow throughout the night which I could forgive since it was busy but we never got water refills and although the restaurant was mostly empty when we were ready to go, it took almost another 15 minutes for our waiter to come back so that we could get the check.</body>

        <body>My wife and I went here for food week . Lunch at 11 30 am . Place was empty when we entered . Staff made us feel like a million dollars . Everyone was courteous . Our meals were excellent and well spaced out as to not rush us . I highly recommend City Lobster and Steakhouse to anyone in the area .</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been coming to this restaruant for years and rave over it.  I think the Prefix Menu is great for the price point.  However, I have to say I was disappointed with the selection of deserts that were offered with the prefix this past weekend.  The quality is not what I remember.  If you made changes, change them.</body>

        <body>restaurant design and atmosphere very common to seafood steak houses just enough decor to not feel under casual but casual enough not to feel stuffy. nice bar crowd but not over whelming service and staff very friendly and attentive.  we visited during Restaurant Week and were very satisfied with options and amount of food given. The cippolini as full of flavor the filet mignon was perfectly cooked with a crispy seared exterior and soft juicy center!</body>

        <body>My wife and I had a good meal but the service was very slow.  I do not blame our waiter, who was congenial and at times apologetic, but the food was really slow nevertheless.  The oysters Rockefeller were very good, but my cioppino was not the best I have had.  My wife had a lobster and it was good, but likewise not special. This is not a bad restaurant, and perhaps just a bad night for them.  We probably will give it another try and I would have no problem recommending it to others.</body>

        <body>This was a last minute reservation and good value for price.  We ordered from the Pre-Fix menu and the portions were generous.   A few  comments would be that the  salmon dish was a bit sweet because of the heavy maple syrup and the key lime pie was very tart.  I personally do not like sweet with fish.   The calamari and mussels were both great appetizers and the apple pie was the perfect dessert.  Overall I would go back as a dinner before attending a show.  The server also forgot our lobster mashed potatoes which once we reminded her she took care of but no apologies even though they came out as we were almost finishing our meals.</body>

        <body>Arriving on time for our 4:00pm March 18th, 2015 dinner, my date and I were warmly greeted by the Hostess. In graciously guiding us to our table, she was able to accommodate my request for a booth.   Our Waitress and Wait Staff were attentive, without &quot;hovering.&quot; The timing of our beverages, salads, entrees and dessert could not have been better. Dining in a relaxed atmosphere, we were really able to  enjoy the cuisine.  During the meal, Adam (Manager) stopped by to check on things and greet us. He made us feel welcomed and valued, as City Lobster &amp; Steakhouse customers.  The meals were nicely prepared and skillfully presented. Compliments to the Chef and food preparation Staff!  Our dinner experience was, in a word, &quot;wonderful!&quot; Our thanks to the City Lobster &amp; Steakhouse Team!</body>

        <body>Recently visited City Lobster during Restaurant Week.  They had by far the most choices for a prix fixe menu I have seen and it was well-worth the $38 per plate dinner price.  We arrived early for our reservation and the wait at the bar was pleasant with quick service from a friendly bar-tender.  Our table had plenty of room for elbows (not so squished as many NYC restaurants) and the noise level allowed for minimal need to lip-read.  The waiter was friendly and prompt with all services.  The food was good and in adequate portions - not the most epicurious but enjoyable.  The Oysters Rockefeller had a tad too much gratin and the calamari was typical but crispy and not greasy tasting.  The scallops were perfectly cooked (but only 3) and the crab cakes were moist and low on filler.  The Bourbon Pecan Pie was a bit hard to cut.  The Sabayon was delicious.   City Lobster is right near Radio City Music Hall and seems to serve as a familiar type of restaurant for tourists.  Overall, a satis</body>

The server immediately apologized and we were served another basket which I observed very carefully, that was my first sign. I ordered scallops and the taste after the second one was horrible. The scallop tasted like ammonia, it was such an awful taste that even my nose felt like it was burning. The dessert was not appealing. I ordered the Manhattan creme burlee cheesecake, not a good taste at all,</body>

        <body>Had our reservation, they gave us a nice table by the window. The waiter was very attentive, the rest of the service staff was exceptional. We chose to order from the Winter Restaurant Week Menu which had some nice choices. The appetizers, soups and salads were all excellent. For entrees, my wife had the salmon and was very happy, my granddaughter had the NY Strip steak which was on the tough side. I had the mussels and was disappointed in the grittiness of the mussels and the flavor of the cooking broth. The desserts were all very good (The profiteroles could have used a dollop of whipped cream and a bit of shaved chocolate).</body>

        <body>What a great find.  This restaurant is located on 49th and 6th away from the pricey Rockefeller Center. The prix fix for $29.50 lunch is well worth it.  The food is delicious and the portions are good sized. I would definitely try this restaurant before going to Rockefeller Center.  It is also close to the theatre district as well.  Can&apos;t wait to go back!!!!</body>

        <body>For the midtown west area this restaurant stands out as one of the few comprehensive fish restaurants. I had eaten at the Grand Central Oyster Bar the prior day where I was disappointed when I did not sea crab cakes on the menu. That was not an issue there. I started with the City Lobster chowder which was tasty and not too salty, and followed it with a crab cake appetizer as my entree. It was more than enough -- especially with two crab cakes. The crab cakes were tasty and did not seem overloaded with fillers. The cocktail sauce was a bit bland, however. All in all I had a good meal.</body>

        <body>City lobster is great. Great food Great drinks and great service.  I knew nothing other than visiting City Island to get seafood. Boy was I wrong. The baked oysters are fantastic and I had the 2lb new brunswick angry lobster. It has more flavor than your typical lobster and I enjoyed it. You will too</body>

        <body>We had the prix fixe lunch here on a Sunday.  Our wedge salads were a good start.  My lobster roll was fine, though not as good as a coastal Maine lobster roll.  My pecan pie was also good.  My wife had Key lime pie, which she said was excellent.  The cost (about $90 for two) seemed par for New York City and lobster.</body>

        <body>After seeing  a  show in NYC theater district myself and 4 other friends headed over to City Lobster and Steakhouse where we enjoyed an amazingly, delicious meal.  The food was phenomenal and the service impeccable.   Atmosphere was one of sophistication and quiet enough for  pleasant dinner conversation.   The menu included a variety of choices and the prices were appropriately set.  Wine and drinks complimented the foods offered.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be returning there in the future.</body>

        <body>We booked for Xmas day thinking this place sounded like fun. Wrong. Our table was booked for 7pm yet we still had to wait a good 20 mins to be seated. Once seated we ordered our food fairly quickly, the starters came out pretty quickly and cleared away fast once we had eaten them.....and now the waiting begins. After 25 mins still no sign of our main courses or waitress, we finally managed to flag her down and get her to ask the kitchen where the food was. They had lost the order! Order was placed again, another 20 mins and it turns out the second order is also lost. We decided not to try a third order and left the restaurant after over 2 hours with no dinner.</body>

        <body>I had very high hopes of a positive dining experience at City Lobster and the restaurant week menu option looked fantastic. I decided this restaurant would be ideal to celebrate our 3 year anniversary. Upon entering the restaurant, there was chaos. It took 3 different people to confirm my 7 pm reservation and after internal confusion we were finally seated, although it might have been easier to actually have taken our menus and sat ourselves. It then took approximately 10 min for our server to approach our table and then after ordering drinks and our menu selections, 20 minutes to receive water and our drink order. We needed to escalate to the manager as the delay was uncalled for. In addition, the tables are so close together and the noise volume so high, having a conversation with my fiancee was challenging. The positive was that our food was promptly delivered and the appetizers were very good. The entree was average as well as the dessert. Overall, I would not recommend this resta</body>

        <body>Booked this restaurant as it was around the block from Radio City Music Hall and parking. I was not sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised. The ambiance is cool, the service was excellent, and the food was good. I was nervous because it was easy to get a reservation but the dinner was great.  I would go back there again anytime I am in the area. Cost was very reasonable especially with a mid-town location where tourist go.</body>

        <body>My husband and I went to a Saturday Matinee on Valentine&apos;s Day.  We&apos;ve never heard of City Lobster (found on Open Table).  The ambiance is lovely. Cozy booths and tables.. Very nautical decor.. It was funny - my husband wanted &quot;Manhattan&quot; Clam Chowder - and they only served New England chowder -- Our waiter was very helpful  telling us this is a New England Restaurant.  Everything was delicious.. We really enjoyed our lunch</body>

        <body>This is a special occasion spot, but it&apos;s well worth the price. The steaks were excellent, the seafood is fresh and the wine is delicious.  Our waiter was top-notch and even took the time to explain wines and where and how they were made and what we&apos;d like most based on our taste.  We&apos;ve come here 2 years in a row for a Christmas celebration near the Rockefeller tree, and we&apos;ll do it again.</body>

        <body>The special menu was anything but that - poor quality, cheaply done.  i inquired about the lobster chowder, if it was a new england style white cream soup base, and was told yes.  i got a bowl of something brown and inedible.  my filet of sole had 10 small greasy string beans with it, and was greasy overall.  the lobster ragout was also brown stringy and awful.  the scallops with mushroom risotto was almost raw and crunchy.  the scallops were very good, the shrimp cocktail was very good.  the deserts were poor as well. asking what was on the creme brulee cheesecake, as concerned with a strawberry allergy, was told there were blueberries with it.  It was sent out smothered in strawberry sauce.   the zabaglione had about a half a strawberry sliced on it, when told it was topped with berries.  paid $100 for (2) people and left hungry.  that&apos;s without any beverages - just water.  So not much of a bargain, to try out the &quot;best&quot; places in ny for a fraction of the cost.  i can think of 20 pl</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been coming here for years, sometimes for a special occasion like a birthday or just because.  I ordered the steak, potatoes and spinach and it was DELICIOUS.  My friend ordered San Francisco Cioppino.  Our waiter was very attentive, made sure everything was good and checked on us often.  He even noticed my steak wasn&apos;t the way I ordered it.  I asked for medium well but I got medium.  We never once felt rushed and he even asked us if we were on our way to a Broadway show after.  We weren&apos;t so he was fine with us taking our time and we were able to enjoy meal.</body>

        <body>Seated at 6pm. Ordered dinner at 6:15pm. Served appetizer at 6:30pm. Finally served entree at 7:20 pm after numerous inquiries as to what happened to our entree. We specifically informed them that we had to be out by 7:30 pm when we were seated.  The server kept telling us it will be any minute for about one half hour. Pre ordered desert arrived at 7:35pm.  We noticed there were other diners complaining about the service also.  Will never return nor recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>Love, love City Lobster! Favorite restaurant in the city. Always good service, great food and never over crowded. Good location for a meal before your Broadway show if you don&apos;t like crowds but still want to be in walking distance.</body>

        <body>We had a great experience at the restaurant.  Our waitress was from Italy.  She was very nice and attentive.   Food was really good,  The mussel appetizer was tender and flavorful, the fillet of sole with lobster was great.  The ahi tuna needed to be a little less cooked.    Nicely decorated for the holidays!</body>

        <body>To be fair, I came for restaurant week. Everything on the menu pretty much had a supplemental...which defeats the purpose of restaurant week. Mussels for appetizer - broth was as savory as I imagined. They didn&apos;t even give me a spoon for the broth. Had the scallop and risotto. Scallops were big and very fresh. Risotto was bland - nothing special. The pieces of lobster wasn&apos;t infused with the risotto like I imagined. There were hardly any pieces of mushrooms. Dessert was pecan pie, it was good. Like the sauce on the ice cream. All in all it wasn&apos;t a restaurant where I try out for restaurant week and then go back for a special dinner.</body>

        <body>I just want to make it clear that we went during restaurant week so perhaps it was busier than usual- but I do expect that a restaurant is still able to sort out reservations.   We had an 8pm reservation and could barely even get in the door to get to the desk. We waited 25 minutes to be seated amd it seemed like everyone else was too.  Some people were getting upset.  We decided to stay by the bar and get a drink.  It took almost 10 minutes to get served and another ten to pay. 2 drinks - a normal sized soco and lime and a 4oz raspberry vodka and sprite was $26. The tea light candles came in the same glasses.  Ok, fine, it&apos;s midtown. We were finally seated and the waitress was great but unfortunately the food was mediocre. They were trying to turn the tables over so fast that the presentation and just general taste was lacking.  The appetizers and dessert were pretty good but the entrees were just sloppily prepared.  I wouldn&apos;t go back again during restaurant week but I&apos;d consider tr</body>

        <body>Food was great. Seated us as a table with a huge hump in the floor knowing that it would be difficult for the chair to be level.  Ultimately moved us to another table. Entrees that were $23.95 on the menu were rounded up to $24.00 on the bill.  Not cool! Fast service.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Cookshop several times, and I&apos;ve always had an amazing experience. This time was no exception. The menu is a comfort food dream, the cocktails are impeccably made, and the friendly service made me feel like I could stay all day. This is by far one of my favorite brunch spots. I just recommend getting your reservation in advance as walking in without could mean a long wait.</body>

        <body>I went to Cookshop with two friends on a Tuesday evening.  The restaurant was very busy and loud.   The noise would be the only draw back because everything else was great.  The food was delicious.  I had the scallop appetizer and swordfish main dish.  Both were cooked to perfection with great flavor and presentation.  We got help from the sommelier regarding our wine choice which was very helpful.  Our waiter was very friendly and the service overall was excellent.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>My husband and I had a late lunch at Cookshop after flying in for a conference.  The food was excellent.  I had the breakfast bowl, which was really flavorful, filling, and healthy.  My husband had the ham sandwich and said it was delicious.  I love that all the New York restaurants make mocktails.  The Cookshop kumquat, ginger lemonade was a definite highlight.    I would go back for sure.  If the weather is nice, I would love to sit outside.</body>

        <body>I found this restaurant by chance when researching Opentable. I was hesitant because I had nothing to go by other then the reviews and I needed a place that could accommodate a large party with only a weeks notice. It was a lucky find because we had a great dining experience; there were 10 of us all together. The food was excellent and there was something for everyone as I have vegetarian friends and meat eaters. Our waiter especially made it a very enjoyable experience by being very attentive to all my high maintenance girlfriends and he was very proactive, taking things back if he didn&apos;t think it was cooked right before they complained. He gave us a complimentary entree (one of the best homemade pasta dishes I have ever tasted) and a dessert on top of what we ordered for no apparent reason other then just being extra nice and making sure everyone was happy. They did not rush us at all, we were there for 3 hours, had many cocktails, 3 bottles of wine, and lots of desserts. I can&apos;t sa</body>

        <body>Let&apos;s start to our table, a bit crowded, but good by NYC standards. Our waiter was friendly and solicitous. My food was good but I&apos;ve had better fish and chips in a number of other places. My guest&apos;s grilled fish came cold and she had to send it back for more cooking. The staff was very apologetic, but in an ideal world (this isn&apos;t) the restaurant should&apos;ve discounted her order from the total bill. Cookshop is a fun place, very lively, with good but not great food. I am basing this opinion on a number of times I&apos;ve visited the restaurant since it opened.</body>

        <body>Wonderful food - I had the roasted chicken which was superb and my friends had the pasta. Loved how they had someone on staff to help us with wine pairings with our dishes since we were only having a glass of wine with dinner.  GREAT desserts too- can&apos;t be missed.  Consistently great food on the few times. I am from out of town - and when I&apos;m in the neighborhood- it&apos;s my must-go to restaurant!</body>

        <body>We loved Cookshop when it opened. But then the menu started to feel tired, so we stopped going. We went back for the first time in 3+ years and the menu didn&apos;t resemble the old menu at all - varied, a bit of an interesting twist to every dish, and quite tasty!</body>

        <body> The kitchen closes at 11am in order to switch over to lunch.  I&apos;ve never seen a NYC restaurant do this,.  We were stuck in traffic, so only had 2 minutes to order.  There is an expectation for NYC restaurants to be open without a gap in service.</body>

        <body>BEYOND belief.  Waited over 45 minutes for our food - two uncomplicated grilled items, sausage and octopus.  On a Saturday night, the management and the wait staff was basically throwing up their hands saying the kitchen was overwhelmed - even though there were many empty tables. I even suggested that perhaps our ticket was misplaced in the kitchen, but they said no, they were just overwhelmed.  HUH? They didn&apos;t open yesterday, they&apos;ve been open for years, how is this possible? I had a clear view of the kitchen, and it was evident that no one was running this place at all.  The couple next to us waited way too long as well and then had to send there food back because there was hair in it. While it was nice that they comp&apos;d us our dinner out of embarassment, I think the worst part is how ill-trained the hostess, manager, and waitress were in how to deal with something like this.  &quot;I&apos;ll go check&quot; only to watch them go into the kitchen and then out again - to other tables. We had to flag</body>

        <body>Had a great meal at cookshop.  Our server was great - very attentive and helpful with the menu.  We had the lamb and the pork and they were both excellent.  The place has a nice feel to it and it feels like a neighborhood restaurant.  The only complaint I have and it was just this last time is that we were seated next to a loud table.  But this can happen anywhere.  So a big thumbs up!!!</body>

        <body>everything was quite tasty, the sommeillier recommended a really nice Nebbiolo d&apos;Alba which I really enjoyed.  My only complaint was that a lot of the dishes had sweet flavor accents, such as apple, figs, or other sweet ingredients.  Not to my taste, and I found it a bit hard to avoid on the menu.</body>

        <body>I made an 8am reservation at Cookshop at the recommendation of the High Line Hotel.  I arrived at 7:53am and received the worst, unfriendly reception by a red-haired, hostess wearing glasses.  (I can only hope this description gives the correct person all the credit she deserves.)  The music was blaring so loudly that I was surprised she heard me say, &quot;good morning, I have an 8am reservation&quot;, to which she replied &quot;yeah, well it&apos;s not 8am yet!  We open at 8.&quot;  I&apos;m certain that most restaurants would welcome patrons who honor their reservations with a bit warmer reception, especially when it&apos;s less than 20 degrees outside.  Not Cookshop.  I understand the High Line is a bit more laid back than Midtown, but if you&apos;re not a morning person -- don&apos;t take the first shift and ruin the day for the adults in the world who are trying to conduct business over breakfast.  This is not a place for a business breakfast!  Slow service and bad attitudes.</body>

        <body>I had the lamb meatloaf which was wonderful, partner had fresh boned trout which was also great.  Apple strudel with buttermilk ice cream was delicious.  A little tight seating, maybe not by NYC standards, but not bad.  Salad was a little bit too bitter and the ginger beer/lemonade was exceptionally tart.  Overall a great meal, fresh ingredients that change with the market daily.  Would recommend</body>

        <body>We were a party of 4, went there just before Christmas for lunch. We were seated promptly despite a line and the service was very good.  I had the mushroom broth with poached eggs for starter - wow, it was so simple yet packed with flavor. It has been 2 months and I still remember the dish!  Definitely a place worth going back.</body>

        <body>The  service at this restaurant was outstanding. Even though this place was packed with people at no point in our dinning experience did we feel rushed. The food and drink was creative, interesting and outdtanding. My first time here and I would definitely go back.</body>

        <body>I have been coming to Cookshop for years and this is the first time I was disappointed. The salad was soggy and salty and it seemed as if everything was just a tad &apos;off&apos;. The bread was hard. Our server was sweet and attentive though.</body>

        <body>I came here with my toddler son to meet up with a friend for breakfast based on a recommendation. My friend ended up being late, but the service staff was accommodating, providing crayons and a coloring book to keep the toddler busy. They put together a table at a booth for us, which was perfect with a squirmy kid.   The food was excellent. I ordered the Cookshop breakfast plate, which was eggs, grits, homemade biscuit, sausage, and eggs. I didn&apos;t care for the sausage too much, personally. However, the grits were amazing and the biscuit was outstanding. The picky toddler liked chomping on grits and bacon. I also ordered the yogurt parfait for the toddler, which we ended up splitting because the homemade granola was so tasty! Mixed with the grape jam and Greek yogurt, it was a perfect combination. My friend ordered the eggs with grits, which came with mushrooms and greens on top. He said it was very good. We both ordered teas, which were a nice touch.   Overall, the experience was posi</body>

        <body>...thinking about that citrus/cake dessert!! so refreshing and delicious!!  Food always great! Always wish you would add wild salmon to the menu.Too much meat, I only eat chicken so I only ever get that! I would actually come more often if the menu wasn&apos;t so meat focused!</body>

        <body>It&apos;s always good to have a range of choices in Chelsea, near galleries, shopping and the High Line. Bookshop does it all with food, service and ambience. It&apos;s contemporary, but not too trendy to sit back and enjoy.</body>

        <body>I ordered the poached eggs which costed $19 and I was expecting more food, but was given only two small poached eggs over some asparagus.  I was expecting a carb, but there was none.  Nonetheless, the eggs were perfectly poached and the food was great.</body>

        <body>I took my mom here for a birthday Lunch and we had a great time. We made reservations and the hostess was being very nice and said if we are willing to wait five min we can get a booth instead of a table if we prefer, that turned out to be worth the wait as the place is a bit croweded so a booth offered more privacy.  The food was great, we ordered fish and pasta dishes for apetizer and main and everything was delicious. The waitress was very helpful and was always there when we needed something. Great experience  will definatly return.</body>

        <body>It had been too long since I&apos;d been to Cookshop. When I lived nearby, it was a staple but now I live uptown. I happen to be in the neighborhood with friends and decided to revisit Cookshop. I quickly realized that I&apos;d been missing it -- great food, great scene, great place. I&apos;ve made a resolution to get there more often.</body>

        <body>This is one of those restaurants that consistently meets, and even exceeds my expectations.  Thus I choose to go back, and back, and back.  The food is always very good, and the atmosphere always (at the times I&apos;ve gone) NY neighborly cool.  Ultimately I go for the service, and on this evening I give special recognition to our server Sean Patrick.  There was a timing mixup in the kitchen, and our entrees came out early.  Sean swooped in, recognizing the faux paus, and immediately put us at ease at to the timing of our meal (entree after appetizers are finished, of course).  The manager later came by to apologize for the misstep.  Unnecessary, but appreciated.   The trout rillete was outstanding as an appetizer, and the sirloin steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection.</body>

        <body>Myself and three friends went here for dinner the other night. I got good poisoning and the three of them were also ill. When I called the restaurant to let them know all they offered me was a complimentary meal if I came back in. Why would I go back to a restaurant that gave me food poisoning? I should have been offered a full refund, but wasn&apos;t. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.</body>

        <body>We come here all the time. Lately the attentiveness of the service staff has been going down. It took us a while to get our waiters attention each time we needed something. And there were like 5 waiters standing around the cash registers doing nothing.  The food was solid as usual.</body>

        <body>The food was delicious and the server went out of her way (Rose) for us alon with the hostess. I took my cousin who is a farmer. The only thing that could have been improved was to cut back a pinch on the salt for the main course. Otherwise, I was amazed at the richness of flavors we all tasted with each course.</body>

        <body>With so many positive reviews for Brunch, I had to check out The Cookshop. Made a reservation through Open Table and was seated immediately. Our waiter was super friendly and very attentive. HIGHLY recommend the apple-cinnamon beignets. The Gingerbread Pancakes were delicious and the Huevos Rancheros had the perfect balance of eggs to beans to tortillas. Nice open layout with lots of windows and green plants..really comfortable atmosphere. Go for brunch on Sunday and get the Rosie&apos;s NYC Bloody Mary!</body>

        <body>my wife and i have been several times to cookshop and find the food to be consistently good and interestingly prepared.  i especially like the fact that they are using heritage breed meat products that have been humanely raised and slaughtered.  we brought another couple with us this time who had never been.  my friend commented after eating the romaine and beet salad that it was the best salad he had ever had and after eating his entree said that he could not wait to come back.</body>

        <body>We came without any expectation. The food and service was surprisingly great, flavour diversity, color combinations.....it was by far the best value for money restaurant we ate during our stay at.NYC</body>

        <body>We were recommended by a friend and it was really very good indeed.  Attention to detail and interest gin but not over fussy combinations - both flavour and texture.  Only issue for some maybe the level of noise as the tables are close and it is VERY popular!</body>

        <body>Brought friends from London here for dinner and had an amazing evening.  The steak was incredible but my favorite was the trout.  AMAZING!  And after dinner, the ice cream sundae!  YUM!   Service was perfect and environment had a great energy!      Thank you!  I can&apos;t wait to come back :)</body>

        <body>Love my entrée at Cookshop (as well all did).  The Bloody Mary&apos;s are delish and freshly made with many different choices.  We had a party of six and we all ordered something different and we tried all of them and we loved them all.  Fresh, healthy foods to make your mouth water for more.  I will be going back..PS:  Our server new everything about Cookshop&apos;s menu and was very informative and that is a very big bonus besides the great food!  Thank you Cookshop!</body>

        <body>Everyone is nice enough, but isn&apos;t it really about the food? My fish tacos were utterly dull: little dried out, cold fish McNuggets; a very hot but tasteless sauce (heat does not equal flavor); a heap of tired vegetables; soggy, flavorless corn tortillas. I was hungry, so I ate as much as I could manage, but not with pleasure. Extremely mediocre.</body>

        <body>i love that cookshop&apos;s menu is seasonal and therefore always changing, but also always reliable. the proximity to the highline makes it the perfect spot to take out of town guests and add a walk along the highline before or after dinner. service is always warm and professional. one of my favorites.</body>

        <body>Had been to Cookshop a few weeks ago. Amazingly, the food this time topped my first great experience. The seared tuna was among my most enjoyable meals ever. I want to go back and have it again ASAP! Lovely front of house staff. Great wine. Warm ambience. Fabulous place.</body>

        <body>Start with some excellent cocktails or a choice of a regular glass of wine or the larger glass if there are not enough of you to try a full bottle.    What a great idea.  The menu was well balanced with choices for small and large appetites with options for snacks to share and appetizers that were a little larger.    Main courses included a substantial vegetarian choice and all dishes were well presented.    We were all too full to sample dessert but would go again.</body>

        <body>Nestled in the Emire Hotel Ed&apos;s is a wonderful restaurant with style and ambience . The hotel  lobby and bar are a great place to start your evening with drinks before enjoying your meal at Ed&apos;s  Prix Fixe at 44.00 is a great value and we have gone in that direction twice as well as going off the menu. The food is always fantastic, the service always attentive and never rushed.</body>

        <body>Ed&apos;s is a solid and reliable restaurant.  Service is efficient, chowders reliably good, nice variety of menu items from salads to entrees.  Our lunch was classic--chowder and clam roll.  We noticed the chairs a bit worn on this visit, and amazingly, a table next to us that had been used was not cleared throughout our entire meal until the very end.  Surprising.</body>

        <body>We were looking for a mid-range pre-Philharmonic dinner on a weekday night. This was our first time at Ed&apos;s Chowder House. We appreciated the attentive service, comfortable seating and respect for time constraints.  We both chose the well-priced Prix Fixe - salad and salmon tartar as starters, cod and seafood linguini as mains. Coffee was hot and a pot was provided for seconds. Dessert choices were limited, but adequate considering the overall meal cost. We will be back.</body>

        <body>Ed&apos;s Chowder House is strategically situated across the street from Lincoln Center.  It&apos;s great for a pre-theater or pre-concert meal. The fish is very fresh and artfully prepared.  Don&apos;t miss the crab chowder. The service could have been a little bit more &quot;friendly&quot; but there was nothing untoward.  One negative is the hard floors and the &quot;scrapy&quot; sound the chairs make when moved which can set your teeth on edge.  The decor looked like it could use a little refreshing, especially the seating.</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve gone to Ed&apos;s Chowder House for years and when some friends who live in Battery Park City said they wanted to come up our way for dinner, this was a logical choice.  It&apos;s located a block from the subway and in the middle of the beautiful Lincoln Center that continues to make enhancements to the property.  The meal was wonderful (I love the fluke) and truly enjoyable.</body>

        <body>I randomly selected Ed&apos;s Chowder House for the location as we were going to Lincoln Center.  We were greeted by very friendly hosts/hostesses/coat check.  Impressed by the casual but warm atmosphere.  Suitable for all ages.  We had a 5pm reservation and were taken right to our table.  Loaded Clam Chowder and Fried Clams were delicious and very hearty portions.  Stuffed Lobster Tail and Filet Mignon for dinner; again a very generous portion.  Filet so tender and the lobster had a good amount of crab on the side.  We were not disappointed with Ed&apos;s.</body>

        <body>this restaurant was convenient to lincoln center and all the westside movie theaters. the bread, unfortunately, is delicious and could make a meal of that. the food looked good and tasted even better. there was no rush to leave and this was restaurant week. well worth the money.</body>

        <body>Always wonderful but ..,  have noticed less food served with orders , (I.e. Order of fries no longer included @ bar menu)which is just a different way of raising prices .    Quite pricey on entrees also, considering the portion size, in particular lobster rolls.</body>

        <body>Dinner before the opera at Ed&apos;s - an excellent choice of fresh oysters; very tasty cod cakes on a bed of coleslaw, velvety smoked salmon, lemon meringue pie.... who could ask for anything more. Ed&apos;s is consistently delightful with a great crew. Highly recommended as a Lincoln Center alternative.</body>

        <body>We are subscribers to the Metropolitan Opera and Ed&apos;s Chowder House is our restaurant of choice. They are organized to serve our meal and send us off in time, even for the 7:30 curtain. I usually get the price fix dinner, but dessert can be rushed. The service is most of the time pleasant and attentive.</body>

        <body>Both myself and my friend enjoyed the food.  However, it should be served hot rather than lukewarm when it comes to &quot;eggs&quot;.   The entire staff is friendly and make you feel right at home.   We did mention that we were attending the Opera and needed to leave in time to make the matinee.  It seems that our wait person forgot but we made the Opera on time.  It is a very relaxing atmosphere so you are not rushed...perhaps why he forgot.  Everyone was nice and that was important. Would definitely go there again.  Thank you.</body>

        <body>Ed&apos;s was not particularly busy on a cold Wednesday evening. Despite empty tables, it took almost twenty minutes to get drinks. After that, we informed our waiter we had a bit of a time issue.  Despite that the soup, which would have to been prepared earlier took another twenty minutes - soup!  We kept looking around for our waiter to remind him we needed to make a curtain but he was nowhere to be found. If it had taken a few more minutes we would have said &quot;forget it.&quot;  As is we rushed through calling for the check when our meal was served.</body>

        <body>They get you in and out for Lincoln Center and it is enjoyable. I learned Not to order the price fixed menu, Just entree and dessert, and that worked like a charm I ordered the skirt steak and it was delicious (the wilted kale was not delicious). Two of us shared the croissant bread pudding for dessert and I would recommend that.</body>

        <body>We are travelling from Australia with 3 kids (13,10, 7) and required a place close to the Lincoln Center as we were attending the Big Apple Circus that evening.  The booking was done via opentable - which I have now used a few times and its great.    We arrived and were promplty seated by the friendly staff. Nothing was a problem for the staff.  The meals arrived in a timely manner and were delicious.  The wine list was also good and reasonably priced.</body>

        <body>The view of Lincoln Center area can&apos;t be beat and if you are going to a performance there is no place more convenient. I had the restaurant week prix fixe of three Ed&apos;s staples. The clam chowder had a great bacon flavor but I prefer mine really thick and loaded with clams, potatoes and celery. The cod was perfectly moist and flavorful. I selected the assorted cookies for dessert, they were disappointingly bland stick with something else.</body>

        <body>My friend and I went for a pre-theatre dinner and had a delightful experience in every way.  We lucked into Restaurant Week so had an excellent 3-course meal for $38.  Also had a great bottle of wine.  Very filling!</body>

        <body>Ed&apos;s Chowder House is situated next door to Lincoln Center which makes it a &quot;go-to&quot; spot when Opera, Theatre or the Philharmonic is your ultimate destination. Unfortunately, Ed&apos;s Chowder House seems to follow the rule &quot;if it ain&apos;t broke don&apos;t fix it.&quot; Not a bad general idea but perhaps inadvisable where menu offerings remain the same year after year. For McDonalds it worked fine but, even fast food is finding it must offer new menu alternatives or suffer the loss of consumer revenue. Ed&apos;s other kitchen weakness is its frequent failure to produce &quot;sides&quot; in time to be eaten with the entrees; despite all items being ordered at the same time. Ordering coffee is yet another problem: for a restaurant where many patrons have a curtain time to meet, surprisingly slow coffee service and presentation and settlement of the bill adds an unnecessary element to getting to the show on time. Best to plan on coffee and dessert after the show AND ask for your bill when entrees are served.</body>

        <body>Was celebrating my birthday by taking my mom out for dinner , then to a benefit taking place at Avery Fisher Hall. We generally go to a place down the street when we go to the theater but as this was a special dinner and I had read previous reviews, decided to try the restaurant. The hostess that greeted us was very nice and the waiter was attentive.  As for the food:  I loved my Tuna Tartare and mom enjoyed her chowder. The Salmon and Cod entrees  were cooked to perfection [fresh and succulent]. I only wish I had room to finish my chocolate ganache  cake. Looking forward to going there again for dinner.</body>

        <body>The seafood is good - very fresh. The deal breaker is that the food is slow &amp;besides seafood, the brunch is nothing special..... it does NOT worth the money. Also the service is bad.. couldnt find our waiter... we waited for 1 hour to get our food.. and when the food finally comes , they have different  waiters came and did not know who ordered which item.  it was a disaster.. we had a group of 8 - we were sitting there and waiting for food and waiters to come ---- BAD EXPERIENCE.  That was a bad experience for this famous restaurant.</body>

        <body>Recent dinner was best ever at this Lincoln Center seafood house. Group of six had a terrific booth seating , a fine waiter, good food.  The fried clams and salad appetizer is large and tasty enough to be a main course. Loaded seafood chowder really worked -- not the pasty/potato mess we once had,  but a truly flavorful  chowder. Shrimps were first rate. Breads, as always, were delicious.  A new favorite before Lincoln Center events.</body>

        <body>Without question, the worst meal I&apos;ve ever eaten in NYC...and I&apos;ve lived here for years. Just a few clam shreds in a tasteless Manhattan clam chowder, a travesty for a restaurant that bills itself as a chowder house. Therefore,  I wasn&apos;t surprised by the also tasteless lobster roll and inedible slaw. Should have left after the bread basket, which was served with lots of warm cornbread.</body>

        <body>Nowhere we would rather eat before a show at Lincoln Center. The food is delicious, the staff polite, and we always get to our show on time.  Right balance of feel fun and feeling relaxed -- we don&apos;t go to a show so revved up we can&apos;t sit still, but we feel like we are part of the city scene.</body>

        <body>First time dining at Ed&apos;s Chowder House. The &quot;Fluke-Flounder&quot; was the best I ever had. The salad was a little bland; attractive presentation and good portion. Our server was very professional and pleasant. We did not have desert; I ordered coffee, which was freshly brewed and served in an individual pot - the way every good restaurant should serve coffee. We will definitely be back!</body>

        <body>We went for a pre-theater dinner for my husband&apos;s birthday -- restaurant is perfectly situated across from Lincoln Center. The interior space was roomy and not noisy at all. Staff all around were friendly. We started with two appetizers -- fried calamari and a special chowder of the day. Chowder was delicious and rich -- full of seafood treasures. Calamari was yummy but not particularly special. For dinner I had seafood over linguini. Hubs had lobster and filet mignon. Portions were large -- I definitely over ordered. Everyone was happy!</body>

        <body>Enjoyed the soups.  We had a great booth. For Christmas, they did a great job. Our server was prompt and attentive. The scallops were not right. Sent them back. No problems. Got the lobster mac and cheese as replacement.</body>

        <body>Lot&apos;s of good seafood in NYC, but this place has consistently the best we find.  Excellent location across from Lincoln Center.  Don&apos;t be fooled by the fact it shares space in a hotel (the Empire) that is not the finest hotel on the planet.</body>

        <body>As always Ed&apos;s is the THE  place before a Met opera. Despite a disastrous trip in, the attentive staff got us out in time after very tasty eats and cocktails. Thank you.</body>

        <body>I hadn&apos;t eaten fluke in 50 years, but was looking for something on the light side, so I ordered it grilled with lemon and capers.  Best fish I can remember eating.</body>

        <body>We went to Ed;s Chowder House at 9:00 pm when happy hour starts.  But happy hour is only in the bar, we don&apos;t recall any specification about this. Wine list is dissapointing.</body>

        <body>My party and I arrived about 20 mins late for our reservation. The hostess was gracious and very nice about it and had someone lead us to our table right away. Our server was amazing, we were in a rush to get to a show and was afraid we wouldn&apos;t make it on time, he immediately asked us what time we had to be there. He put in the orders for use and everything came out one after the other and we made it to our show with 5 mins to spare! He was attentive and kept track of the time for us.   We ordered the chowder sampler, the mushroom was by far my favorite, as I love truffle. The Ed&apos;s shellfish chowder in the lobster bisque it was amazing as well. For the app we got the scallop ravioli and it&apos;s a must try. The scallops were fresh and the ravioli shells were very thin. My friend ordered the mushroom risotto with shrimp and it was great, warmed you right up in the cold weather we are having right now. I had the lobster roll, I&apos;ve had better but no complaints.   We will definitely be going</body>

        <body>the location is good - near lincoln center. the food was good with good choices but we did not have time for dessert since service was slower than we would have liked - even though we told the waiter our time constraint.</body>

        <body>My second time at this restaurant and enjoyed it again. Nice menu and great service. My only complaint is that the portion size is a little small for the money, but then again, it&apos;s NYC. If you like seafood, you&apos;ll enjoy Ed&apos;s very much. Great for pre/post Lincoln Center activities.</body>

        <body>We went pr-theater and tried their priced-fixed menu, which at $44 was overpriced.  One guest complained that the Manhattan clam chowder was over-spiced and salty..  The grilled salmon was fine, cooked to my specifications (medium rare).  The 1 ½ pound lobster, served shelled, was definitely not 1 ½ pounds, soaking wet.  We did not try the rest of the a al carte menu.  Maybe that was better,</body>

Main courses included skate, pasta with clam sauce, hake, crab cakes, &amp; cod kept us quietly Savoring everything. Ice creams, Apple cobbler &amp; excellent French press coffee rounded out the meal. Very good service all around. We&apos;ll all be back!</body>

        <body>My teenage daughter&apos;s favorite restaurant.  Very NYC-ish.  Great for before Lincoln Center.  Stylish but not a scene.  Since the place empties significantly by 8, you sometimes get a sense that the servers vacate too at that time, which makes one feel pressure to wrap it up.  Other than that, delightful.</body>

        <body>If you have 60-75 minutes to kill before a performance over at Lincoln Center, try Ed&apos;s Chowder House for drinks and appetizers.   We tried it for the first time Friday night and had a great time sipping two martinis and two of every oyster they had on the raw bar (2 x 5 = 10). The cocktails aren&apos;t cheap, but they&apos;ll getcha tuned up for a concert if you know what I mean...</body>

        <body>Ed&apos;s Chowder House is in the Empire Hotel, directly across from the Lincoln Center fountain.  They have a nice seafood-oriented menu and a great wine list.  Flights of three different clam chowders are not something you see every day !  Very good service and they got us to the show in plenty of time...</body>

        <body>Service was gracious, prompt and excellent. But food and atmosphere were a little bland. It didn&apos;t help that we went fairly early (6:45) and it looked like there was nobody under 60 in the place.  It was just a little too sedate. Food was good but not outstanding. You can do better in this fairly high price range.</body>

        <body>We have been to Ed&apos;s many times and the food is always good, as is the service.  They understand the need to keep people on time when heading to a performance at Lincoln Center and have never disappointed.  While the lobby/reception area can get a bit crowded, and the bar is usually full, they respect a reservation time and do not keep you waiting.</body>

        <body>I don&apos;t know how I&apos;ve overlooked Ed&apos;s Chowder House, but some savvy friends suggested it and I&apos;ll certainly be back. it&apos;s on the second floor of the Empire Hotel, right across the street from Lincoln Center, a great location. With a 6:45 reservation and 8pm curtain, our waiter suggested we might do better with two courses -- an appetizer and entree or entree and dessert --rather than the three-course $44 prix fixe, but our food arrived in a timely fashion and we had time for coffee before heading to the Mitzi Newhouse Theatre. Another time we&apos;ll linger longer; the rooms are lovely, with high ceilings and a view of the tops of the Lincoln Center buildings. The tables are booths are far enough apart that conversation is possible even when the restaurant is full. A friend and I ordered the salmon, mine as listed in the entrees, over vegetables and hers from the simple fish column, served with arugula, both dishes perfectly cooked to our requests. Another time I&apos;ll try the cod, which her </body>

        <body>My friend and I hadn&apos;t been here in a long while and we are definitely coming back soon!  Plus I&apos;m going to suggest Ed&apos;s to some other friends.  We had the salmon tar tare and the fluke as an entrée.  Both were  delicious.  The entrée portion was very generous too so it was worth the price.  The waiter and busboy were very attentive and gracious.  The tables are a little close but because it&apos;s such a large and airy venue, you don&apos;t feed crowded.</body>

        <body>Ed&apos;s is a favorite near Lincoln Center.  The food is terrific; you can choose your noise level, which falls as your table is farther from the bar.  This time, Ed&apos;s offered a restaurant week menu of their signature starters and mains.   What a wonderful deal!  I had the salmon tartar with a touch of crème fraiche  and caviar and the Chatham cod covered in potato chips.  My friend, who ordered from the main menu, had the shrimp cocktail and the chilled half lobster.  One great thing about Ed&apos;s--you can choose a meal to fit your level of hunger and your dietary preferences.  Nice listing of wines by the glass.</body>

        <body>Although we were seated promptly for an 8:45 reservation, we had to signal to the captain to get a waiter. Then, the service was so slow that we almost cancelled the balance of the meal after appetizers. The food was not up to the quality of past dining experiences there.</body>

        <body>I have had several great dinners here.  I brought my 5-year-old great-nephew and friends for dessert after the Nutcracker.  That was a big success.  Most recently I had brunch with a friend.  My only disappointment was that no bread came with my omelet.   The omelet was fine and came with very nice potatoes.  The server was very nice and helpful, as the staff always is, but she told me that an order of toast would cost $5.  Seriously . . .</body>

        <body>Well...the food was very good.  The chowder sampler was great (3 types), and the crispy calamari was tasty, served with spicy saffron aoili.  For an entree, I had a perfectly prepared Tuna Steak; my friend had great seared scallops.  I would rate the food 4 out of 5 stars.  Regarding the service, I specifically called over the waiter during my appetizer, because I was feeling very &quot;rushed&quot; by the staff, in general.  The appetizers came out very, very fast after ordering (less than 5 minutes)...I was concerned that my entree would come rushing out the moment I completed my two-thirds of my appetizer.   When I dine out, I generally expect to spend about 45-60 minutes at the table.  My friend and I wanted a few minutes between appetizer and entree, to have a cocktail and chat before the entree was served.  I called over the waiter to specifially let him know that i was feeling rushed.  The restaurant was not full.    I said simply:  &quot;We&apos;ve been here only 10 minutes, and my appetizer was </body>

        <body>Booth was a bit tight for our party of 6. Food and wine was a pleasure. Service was good. Great place to go. I will be back.</body>

        <body>I have always walked past this place with wonder! Well we finally went in for a lunch date with the hubs!  Can you say awesome.  The lunch special: half lobster roll, cup of chowder, fries and slaw, is heavenly.  It gives just enough if everything.  The flavors weld together perfectly. Definitely will return.</body>

        <body>Ed&apos;s chowder house has plenty of well shucked oysters and  decent selection of wines by the glass for a quick snack before lincoln center. We appreciate the smart service designed to get you across the street in time for the curtain. Impressively, the staff at ed&apos;s chowder house does this  graciously without ever making you feel rushed.  No small achievement. I&apos;ve never ordered anything but simply grilled seafood and vegetables, not liking a full belly before a full musical evening. Everything we&apos;ve eaten has been well prepared and precisely as ordered.</body>

        <body>We were a party of 6 - all arriving at different times - each of us was greeted almost immediately by our waiter who was extremely accommodating throughout the very delicious meal.  at the end, one of our group actually asked for separate checks ( the reset of us were aghast!) - our waiter smiled and said &quot;...sure...&quot;  he could do that!!  We were all pleased that we got one of the corner round tables - giving us extra privacy and a view of the entire place.</body>

        <body>This is my 3rd visit to Ed&apos;s Chowder House and was extremely disappointing.  Service was extremely slow, causing us to rush the dessert course because we had to leave for the ballet.  Waiter was pleasant and friendly, but inattentive...we had to track him down to ask where our meal was and he never came by to ask if everything was ok.  One of the servers brought a bowl of chowder to our table, but we had never ordered it...perhaps the servers gave our meals to a different table?  Either way, our waiter should have stopped by to explain the delay.  At least the food was good.  Previous visits were to the bar area and service was exemplary...seems that&apos;s the best place to eat if you want good service.  The dining room chairs were very shabby with many holes in the white leather...not a very appetizing environment.  Again, the bar area is MUCH nice and conducive to a nice meal.</body>

        <body>I would deffffffff recommend their Chowder!! My husband said he wants to keep coming  because of the chowder! And we had Fried clam salad which was so good and White sauce pasta was amazing.  Stuffed Lobster was amazing too. So.. basically, everything was so good that we promised that we will come here more often. Price was okay too. I cannot wait to bring my entire family.</body>

        <body>First arriving at the restaurant the hostess was rude. We couldn&apos;t find our reservation and the hostress just stood there staring at us. So I told her we confirmed that morning and she said we don&apos;t have it. Not offering to check under another name which I suggested they were able to find it after I was persistant. Food was good not great and our waitress was very sweet.</body>

        <body>This was our first visit to this restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised.  Physically, the space was very spacious, well appointed, and presented a relaxed atmosphere.  The drinks at the bar were generous and well made.  We had the fixed price dinner that I thought was an excellent value. We all had the cod as our main entrée and it was nicely presented and very well prepared.  The entire meal was a delight and I would definitely return to this restaurant the next time I am near Lincoln Center.</body>

        <body>We went there for a late Christmas lunch and despite tables available where other diners were, in the bright open section, we were placed at the back of the restaurant all alone. It was rather dark and sad. I didn&apos;t think to ask to switch till half way through my main, by them too late. Our first time there and rather disappointed, not memorable at all.</body>

        <body>I have always avoided this price assuming it was overpriced and mediocre, being another sprawling Lincoln Center area tourist trap.  However, I really enjoyed our meal last Saturday night before seeing a show at Lincoln Center.  The bill won&apos;t be cheap, but everything was pretty delicious, fresh, perfectly cooked, and piping hot the way it should be.  The portions were sizable.  The restaurant is comfortable and grown-up, friendly and sophisticated.  I&apos;ll be back!</body>

        <body>While the food was okay and the decor very nice, the service took away from the experience. They could not get orders correct; the hostess sat people on top of each other and for the price, the food was okay. Although the $25 price fixe lunch is worth it.</body>

        <body>This restaurant is perfectly located for any performance at Lincoln Center.  The food is very good and the service is usually quite attentive.  On this most recent visit, though, it looked ready for a face lift.</body>

        <body>We love Ed&apos;s Chowder House! We ate there the last time we were in NY and knew we wanted to come again.  We had dinner there to celebrate our Grandson&apos;s First Birthday. The staff was exceptional and assisted without us even asking. The seafood appetizer was delicious as was all of our entrees. Our grandson made a meal of mussels, and assorted vegetables from all of our dinner plates. He never stopped eating! The desserts were delicious including our grandson&apos;s special Banana Cream Pie.</body>

        <body>The menu is limited but sufficient.  the chowder, oddly enough, had very few clams though the clams linguine had plenty. Portions are pretty big and the service was excellent.  we have been at Ed&apos;s many times and no matter the weather or season, it has always been grossly overheated/under cooled.  when combined with the crossed, noisy atmosphere, the overall experience suffers.</body>

        <body>Fruition is a wonderful neighborhood restaurant.  The menu is fairly small with innovative selections.  Some of the items may come from Alex Seidel&apos;s farm.  The pasta carbonara is worth it&apos;s great reviews.  We go as often as we can get a reservation.  Sometimes it can be a long wait.</body>

        <body>While it is very good, my entrée was very salty (steak).  I had a friend say the same thing after she had been there a month or so ago.  It&apos;s a wonderful restaurant but please address that.  There are many people that cannot have salt.</body>

        <body>I went to Fruition with a group of women friends that hadn&apos;t seen each other for a while.  We had such a lovely evening of great wine and food.  The oysters were incredible, and we all shared the duck, lamb and vegetarian dish that were all wonderful. Service was impeccable.  Fruition is highly recommended.</body>

We so appreciated the warm atmosphere, in which we could actually hear one another without raising our voices.  We could relax into the whole experience, never feeling rushed or pushed.

        <body>Wow- I waited 2 years to finally book a table at Fruition. I think I have a fair amount of experience eating at finer restaurants around Denver. Our meal was 50/50. My husbands app and dinner were delicious- if not very heavy and salty- pork and meat dishes. The carbonara and short ribs. On the other hand- My Brussel sprout app was awful. The sauce was thick and tasteless and the flavor a did not stand out. My entree was lamb. Again the sauce was like smokey paste. Not bad but awful. The meat- nothing special. For dessert we had lemon meringue with blueberry compote. Could have been from Costco. I am very sorry to write this review. I you are into 50/50 give Fruition a shot. Oh and Barramundi.. Just call it Austrailian Sea Bass. Not one person knew what it was in the restaurant.</body>

        <body>My husband and I chose Fruition for an early Valentine&apos;s Day celebration because it&apos;s our favorite special-occasion restaurant in Denver. The food was fabulous as always--imaginatively paired ingredients, beautifully presented, and perfectly prepared. My Brussels sprout appetizer and duck breast entree were both outstanding. Unfortunately, the service was not up to the restaurant&apos;s usual standard. Our server, despite having a very appealing personality, was responsible for all seven tables in the small room leading to the kitchen and was quite slow in delivering our drinks at the beginning of our visit and our check at the end. She also switched our entree orders (easily corrected but not auspicious). Perhaps seven tables are too many for one server.</body>

        <body>I was disappointed with the food, which I usually really enjoy.  Sweet candied nuts in the sun choke soup detracted from the flavor.  I&apos;ve enjoyed the duck twice before, but this time it was lukewarm and not as tasty.  The confit was sliced and difficult to tell from the magret.</body>

        <body>Fruition is one of my all-time favorite restaurants.  Fruition consistently offers exceptional food.  The combinations of ingredients, flavors and colors presents each dish as unique and special.  The ingredients are fresh and the taste of each piece combines beautifully with the other elements of the dish.  The presentation of each dish is art, very carefully thought out.  Everything I&apos;ve eaten there possesses a quality of &quot;that was delicious; I wouldn&apos;t have thought to do that&quot;.  The creativity keeps me coming back. The service is top notch, attentive without being intrusive.  The atmosphere is intimate with about 15 tables.  It is quiet without making you feel self-conscious for having a normal conversation.  It is pricey, but if you want cheap, there are plenty of burger joints around. Here you get what you pay for and that makes the price tag worth it.  Fruition also changes their menu often, so there is more than enough reason to come back frequently.  Enjoy!</body>

        <body>The Fruition Restaurant was classic farmhouse kitchen feel with wonderful flavor in selections we made.  Mixtures in plate that sounded interesting and followed through with an explosion on the palate.  A quaint little place for date night but not set up for large groups.</body>

        <body>We absolutely loved every aspect of our dining experience at this place last night.  If I had one less than positive comment to make, we were happy to get a cozy, romantic corner table.  It is quite small inside and I would have felt awkward if I was seated at one of the tables in the middle of the open floor.  When I make future reservations, I would specify seating along the wall.</body>

        <body>Our food was extraordinary, from the oysters rockefeller to the Oloroso sherry at the end.  service superb.  I took my partner here for birthday dinner expecting to be slammed with the bill, especially after we added her daughter due to a snowstorm in her hometown.  With appetizers, entree (AMAZING) a very nice bottle of wine and sherry at the end, the cost for the three of us was what i was expecting for two.  Service impeccable, server really knew the food and wine; attentive but not pestering.  They source most ingredients from their farm outside CO Springs.  Clearly the attention to the food ingredients has the same level of care and attention as the preparation and presentation in the kitchen.  This is one of Denver&apos;s greatest restaurants.</body>

        <body>Fruition is a top notch restaurant fit for foodies. Excellent for a special occasion or special someone. The space is small and cozy and a recent renovation is very tasteful - evoking a casual luxury ambiance. The food was very flavorful and the beef stroganoff was a decadent, elevated version of a classic. The vegetarian option was impressive and I would recommend it as 2 appetizers  to share at your table - even if you&apos;re not a vegetarian. The lamb was the best we&apos;ve ever had. The banana walnut bread dessert was to die for. The pineapple cake desert needs improvement in both taste/texture and presentation.</body>

        <body>Wonderful experience from entry to exit. Great atmosphere and even better food. Also thoroughly enjoyed the wine and after-dinner drink selection. By the time we left, there was quite a wait, so make a reservation. Also, there&apos;s no formal parking, so it might take a few extra minutes to find a parking place in the neighborhood.</body>

        <body>Amazing service!! &apos;It was our anniversary &amp; we received personalized menus wishing us Happy Anniversay. After we initially sat down, they brought us a complimentary glass of Rose&apos;. we also received a small dessert at the end. Monkfish was so delicious &amp; so were the brussel sprouts!</body>

        <body>This restaurant never ceases to amaze me!!  I made reservations and it was my husband&apos;s birthday.  When we entered the restaurant, they acknowledged my husband&apos;s birthday immediately.  His menu was even personalized with his name on it!!  With that said, my husband had a beet salad and I had the ham and pea soup for a starter.  Then we had the barramundi and duck breast for main course.  The food was absolutely amazing!!  All during the evening, the staff continued to identify my husband and extended birthday wishes.  It was a wonderful, memorable and very tasty evening.</body>

        <body>It was a great evening for my wife and I to celebrate our anniversary.  The appetizers were fantastic.  Octopus Carpoccio was amazing.    The only slight criticism is the Pork Shoulder was dry.  I thought it would be moist and juicy but instead it was very dry.  I did not finish half of it.  Other than that, the food was quite good.</body>

        <body>We hadn&apos;t been in quite some time and were so impressed!  The food was awesome -- creative, inspired and very fresh -- the ambiance was cozy and not rushed, the wait staff were great -- it was all in all one of the best meals we have had in some time.  Denver has a ton of new restaurants but this one should outlast most because its fundamentals are so strong and sustainable.  Great place!</body>

        <body>Reading such rave reviews made us choose this restaurant on our visit to Denver.  The place is charming, the service, casual and friendly.  The food was nicely presented with very fresh and interesting flavors.  So many flavors that I forgot what I had ordered when my meal arrived.  Maybe the chef tries too hard to create a unique cuisine. All in all, the four of us decided it was good but not deserving of the hype.</body>

        <body>Upon arrival, the maitre  d&apos; couldn&apos;t find our reservation on Open Table.  Rather than being gracious even after we showed him our Open Table account, he seemed put out.  It seemed that the problem was with Open Table, which is very difficult for a small establishment.  He placed us at a table near the cold front door where other guests stood waiting for their tables.  Our waiter appeared too busy to help us with a wine selection, and although he stated he would have the sommolier help us, no one ever came.  Of course the food was very good as usual.  I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll return, but will request seating in the back room.</body>

        <body>This restaurant is set up in a small house along 6th Ave.  Walking in you definitely get that romantic vibe.  The waitstaff is very friendly right off the bat!  Everything I ate was divine, but I have to recommend the lamb.  So tender, full of flavor... yum!  I have a gluten allergy, and the waitress never was bothered by it.  She brought my a gluten free flat bread to enjoy with my husband while he was eating their fresh baked breads.  This is definitely a romantic date spot that I look forward to visiting again.</body>

        <body>I am a small woman, not overweight and not known as having a large appetite. However, after having the trout here, which came with a small piece of fish and virtually nothing else on the plate other than garnishes, I had to go home and eat!  That seems absolutely ridiculous given the prices.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve tried several times over the last year to get into Fruition and couldn&apos;t because I&apos;m always last minute and their reservation list is always quite full.  Since it was a Tuesday morning I got lucky and booked dinner for my wife and I.  It&apos;s in a neighborhood and parking is on the street so be prepared to walk a bit if need be.  We were greeted by an enthusiastic host who seated us at a nice table in back.  The restaurant only seats 50 and I don&apos;t think there would be a bad table with the possible exception of right near the door.  There was a large group in the small second room and I think they may have been tasking the available manpower just a bit as it was a few moments before we really saw any waitstaff.  Our waiter Cody was very professional providing a nice balance between knowledgeable attentiveness and staying clear of our quiet dinner.  I ordered a cocktail that had B&amp;B, lemonade and honey in it, don&apos;t remember the name, and it was very tasty leading me to seconds.  The </body>

        <body>The service and food were terrific!  I was in Denver for a conference and was looking for a restaurant away from the convention center traffic where I could entertain some associates.  Fruition came highly recommended by a number of sources, and it did not disappoint.  The menu is nicely focused on a carefully crafted selection of flavors and ingredients, that made ordering an entertaining experience.  We ordered the Pan Roasted Brussels Sprouts, Spanish Octopus Carpaccio, Potato-Wrapped Oysters Rockefeller, and Pasta Carbonara to start, and each one was over the top.  The main course selections were fantastic as well, so we felt compelled ot add dessert...Holy Cow, what a great meal.  Seriously, the food here was so good, that if I lived in Denver, I&apos;d be there at least twice a month.</body>

        <body>Fruition has been our favorite in Denver for the last two-three years. (Mizuna before that).  We went again over the holidays.  And again, all of the appetizers, main courses and desserts were exceptional.  We discussed that we cannot remember ever having a dish that we did not like.  This is such a great restaurant.</body>

        <body>The food was excellent, absolutely first rate.  The service was slow, perhaps because the restaurant was short-handed or overwhelmed with customers on the night we were there.  It took at least 20 minutes to get around to taking our orders. The only real slip-up, other than general slowness, was bringing soup cold when it should have been hot.  The waiter was, however, quick to volunteer to bring another bowl, and this time it was hot.  On a cold night, one gets a bit of an icy blast when the front door is opened, so it is desirable to be seated in a location protected from the front door.</body>

        <body>Food was delicious but undercooked. They grilled it again so outside of the meat was dry inside was still pink. Even tough it wasn&apos;t cooked as I wanted still it was very tasty. I kindly requested a slice of birthday cake for my wife&apos;s birthday and send them this as a message through opentable. Either they did not read it or they did not care. It is a good restaurant but I am surprised that they are number one. Still I recommend it.</body>

        <body>This is still one of the best over all restaurants in Denver. Alex and his team always hit just the right notes with everything. I have been to his farm and just knowing some of the food served is that fresh, organically grown and prepared with such care and artistry  is such a plus. He raises his own sheep ( fabulous cheeses) and pigs. There are many fine restaurants in Denver and I have visited most but Fruition remains a stand out!</body>

        <body>Very nice, cozy atmosphere with very few tables.  The service is great and the food unbelievably good.  My wife had the beef stroganoff and it was the best we has ever had.  I had the duck and it was done perfectly.  We can&apos;t wait to go back!</body>

        <body>We ate here on 12/29/14 and had reservations. We waited a bit to get our table. The food was good but to be honest, I have had just the same if not better elsewhere and believe its over-hyped as well. Our biggest complaint is how SLOWWWWW the service is. Took us over an hour to just get food and a long time to just get a drink besides water. We were there for over 2.5 hours. Took us forever to get dessert. Literally we were about to fall asleep at our table. I will be honest, we didnt leave with a WOW experience and not sure when or if we will return.</body>

        <body>We heard about Fruition through a recommendation from a friend. The restaurant seems small and nondescript from outside, but inside is magical. Small and cozy, the staff the very attentive. The menu does have a lot of selections, but the food is fantastic. The best way to describe it is that they put a bunch of seemingly mismatched items together into a delicious combination of fresh food. It&apos;s very, very good. Yes, it is on the pricey end of the spectrum, but you should know that going in. Take your time, be prepared to spend a little cash and you will have a great time.</body>

        <body>My wife and I had an early dinner for our 44th wedding anniversary in the redecorated restaurant.  The new décor is very nice albeit a little more modern and less rustic then it used to be but still very tastefully done.  For starters my wife had the pan roasted brussel sprouts which came with watercress, pickled squash, cranberry granola and poached pear vinaigrette and I had the rabbit cassoulet with a cheese popover, white beans, rabbit confit and mushrooms.  Both were simply outstanding.  For the main course, my wife had the duck breast which came with potato gnocchi, duck confit and braised kale while I had the lamb loin with carmelized salsify, lamb pancetta, mushrooms and faro verde vinaigrette.  Both dishes were outstanding and the combinations of different flavors and textures worked for both dishes.  For dessert we shared the hazelnut chocolate dacquoise- vanilla bean ice cream, passion fruit, chocolate fudge.  This was also excellent although the passion fruit was very swee</body>

        <body>Fruition is one of the premiere restaurants in the Denver metro area with good reason.  Their passion for fresh ingredients and precision in execution is evident from the first bite to the last delicious morsel.  One of our dearest friends celebrated his birthday on our blog weekend so he selected the restaurant.  We were thankful for his selection because Fruition is always found on several of the &quot;Top Restaurant&quot; lists in the city.

        <body>The food was exquisite!  Unique yet familiar.  I had the duck.  A blending of perfectly proportioned flavors I didn&apos;t even know went together.  The duck itself was melt-in-your mouth tender. Combined with the rest of the dish, every bite seemed new and dreamy.  Everyone at our table was completely happy with their food.   The restaurant is quiet enough to not have to shout.  Very relaxing.  Intimate but still roomy.  Our server was the most professional ever; what a pleasure - polite, always available yet never intrusive.</body>

        <body>When we lived in Denver this was our favorite restaurant. It was our first time back since moving away, and we were delighted to find that Fruition still delivers an amazing dining experience.  We order the pasta carbonara every time, we can&apos;t help it. A light delicious starter with crispy pork belly, poached egg an fresh spring peas. We dream about this dish. Cody was our server an took amazing care of us, attentive without being over bearing.  My girlfriend loved the wine we ordered and Cody told us about the wine producer and how it was a rare release. He wrote down all of the information for us so we could find the wine or at least the same varietal again. He even gave local wine shop recommendations for where we could pick up a bottle while in town.  Another amazing night at Fruition!</body>

        <body>We went here for my birthday. The food was great - especially the brussels sprouts appetizer. I loved the atmosphere - intimate and comfortable - even though the tables are close together, you are not aware of the other folks and cannot hear other conversations. The only disappointment was our waiter. He did not seem interested in us at all - was not very friendly (didn&apos;t even comment on my birthday although he knew about it). He seemed a bit arrogant and bored with us. It was a low point in the otherwise very nice experience.</body>

        <body>Fruition never disappoints.  The food is outstanding, and the servers take tremendous pride in their work, and the meal is never rushed.  I cannot think of a better restaurant in Denver.  Make reservations well in advance.</body>

        <body>Though Fruition is commonly regarded as the premier restaurant of the Denver dining scene, I have had better in this city. The service was outstanding, but the overall experience was more in line with casual dining than what I was expecting. For how expensive the dishes were, I was expecting a little more grandiosity.    The decor is passable - good looking chairs, booths and tables with warm colored walls and bland black and white sketch art with a very cheap looking ceiling and lighting. Nothing really jumped out as noteworthy or exciting.  The food was, overall, very good, but with one major complaint. Everything is incredibly salty. The butter that is brought to the table with the bread (which had an incredibly hard and difficult to eat crust) is blended with large chunks of sea salt. When you are expecting to take a bit of warm bread and smooth butter and bite into a large, gritty chunk of salt, it is not a pleasant sensation. Our entrees (Bavette steak and Duck breast) were acco</body>

        <body>We arrived at our reserved time but there was no table waiting for us, as a result, we had to awkwardly stand in the entrance (there is no waiting area). When we were finally seated, we sat at the table for about 10 minutes and had to eventually call a server over to our seemingly step-child-of-a-table and request service.   Now that we had finally managed to lure service to our table, I was hoping things would turn around but the food was average and there was no attempt to make up for the lack of attention. One particular dish said it came with broccoli and there was literally one piece of broccoli on the plate. After we requested a side dish of more broccoli, it came out doused in some dreadful lime sauce that made it difficult to even be polite to the server, who went back to fetch it for us, and consume it.    I will never go back here and sincerely hope this review prompts someone else to search for an alternative restaurant.</body>

        <body>I am a big foodie and I am into organic and sustainable foods.  Not only does Fruition for that bill they go even further.  They source most of their food locally and do an amazing job with quality, taste and presentation.  Fruition is my go to place.</body>

        <body>Took over 25 minutes to be seated despite having reservations.  Overall meal took 2hrs 30min -- way too much time between apps, entrees, dessert, etc  Oysters Rockefeller were a complete failure, Scallops entree was just OK, 3 small scallops...  Waiter brought us an entire dish of butter and 1 slice of bread each.  Quit being so stingy with your bread.</body>

        <body>Four of us enjoyed dinner here last Saturday night.  Menu offered a good variety including a vegetarian option.  We all enjoyed a starter, entree and dessert. Every bite was wonderful, such well prepared food and interesting savoury pairings. Service is top notch, staff is friendly yet not in your face and everything is executed with a perfect rhythm. Space is comfortably small, intimate and noise level is also comfortable.</body>

Our waiter, Cody, was amazingly knowledgeable about all aspects of our dining experience, from appetizer to dessert, dinner wine to dessert wine.  The food was interesting and, most importantly, very good - literally bursting with flavor with every bite.  We felt welcome, comforted and appreciated at every point in the meal.  We will be back, and soon!</body>

        <body>My first impression of Fruition was that it reminded me of a romantic bistro you might find in NYC. Very small, but cozy. The decor was timeless and simple. All staff, from the lovely hostess, our server and busser were all so warm and gracious. The food was everything I was hoping for and more.  The menu is small, but it&apos;s dense.  Each dish is jam packed with unique sauces, beautifully prepared vegetables and garnishes. It was clear that every dish was made with an immense amount of craft and a painstaking attention to detail.   Plating-10 Technique-10 Originality-10 Ambiance-10</body>

        <body>My husband and I have been to Fruition several times over the last few years and have always had a great experience.  The service is always top notch....servers/waiters are very attentive without being intrusive.  Courses were delivered in a timely manner.  I have become gluten intolerant in the past couple of years and Fruition&apos;s chef has accommodated my special diet.  The food is always delicious and high quality.</body>

        <body>Two from our party of four ordered the pork, which was dramatically under cooked. One member had the lamb, while the fourth had the monk fish. While eatable, the lamb and fish were underwhelming. Oysters Rockefeller appetizer was tasty, and the salads also were delicious. However, it is always sad when the tastiest dish turns out to be the dessert, which was comped due to the pork fiasco. At least the dogs at home enjoyed the remnants of the pork, but they will eat anything. This used to be a go to restaurant, but no longer for us.</body>

        <body>We were hoping for amazing flavors, but they never arrived.  When our waiter came to take our drink order, he asked us if we were ready to order our meal too.  It seemed rushed and in fact, we were not ready and wanted to relax and enjoy the evening.  We had a hectic day and were looking forward to this evening which we booked a month in advance.  I ordered the fruition 75 drink which was gin and pomegranate mix, served in a wine glass.  It tasted like sangria, but I I was expecting a martini style drink.  My husband ordered a simple tonic water, but received club soda.   It took the waiter another 15 minutes to bring the correct drink back to the table.  We shared the pan seared Brussels sprouts which arrived at a room temperature. For our entrées, I odered the bass which was overcooked and the risotto was way too rich to complement the bass.  The tiny fingerling potatoes were underdone and firm.  I accidentally dropped my knife on the floor which I needed since the crust on the bass</body>

        <body>Enjoyed a lovely pre-Christmas lunch. Festive atmosphere, good food, decent service - a little slow due to the crowd. Food took awhile to arrive. Chicken Velvet soup was delicious and took me back to when I was kid having lunch and visiting Santa at the Ayres Tea Room. Really like the lunch menu - several delicious, affordable options.</body>

        <body>My boyfriend and I went to Harry and Izzy&apos;s this past weekend during Devour Downtown.  I had never been before and wanted to give it a try after hearing great things.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time, the service was on task, and the food was amazing.  Thank you for a great night!</body>

        <body>We were extremely pleased with our entire experience. This was my first time at the downtown location and I brought a group of out of town guests. Parking was easier than I thought it would be our wait was minimal. The menu offered a great choice of price point for my guests, while still providing an upscale dining experience. Only downside is hiking down the stairs to use the restrooms!  Get the spicy Asian shrimp appetizer, and your steak Izzy style: you won&apos;t be disappointed!</body>

        <body>I was going for a special occasion.  I&apos;ve been before and thought it was amazing.  The staff are quite competent.  Our waiter appeared to have extensive knowledge of the menu items and was able to recommend a lot of the menu standouts.  Steak was very yummy, just a tad undercooked but then again it was a fairly busy Saturday night.  I&apos;d recommend this place if you&apos;re looking to network with people or just get a steak and some nice wine with friends.  It&apos;s good for either!</body>

        <body>When I visit Indy I eat here multiple times per visit as well as take out because I love it so much. Got to have the cocktail sauce (I&apos;m allergic to shellfish) so if you can&apos;t eat shrimp, ask the server for a small cup of the sauce to dip their awesome hot dinner rolls into.   You can make a full meal from a half salad (highly recommend the beet salad), the mini bone in filet appetizer and a side of cream spinach, or any one of their amazing side dishes. Make sure to leave room for desert. Their steaks are amazing but you&apos;ve got to have a big appetite, I usually split with a friend so I can have other items and not overeat. Everything on the menu is great so whatever you choose, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</body>

        <body>Had the &apos;FAMOUS&apos;shrimp cocktail which gives you some nice extra-large to jumbo shrimp in some extremely fresh and spicy horseradish cocktail sauce which is apparently the attraction to this appetizer. I ordered the Harry and Izzy&apos;s New York strip steak which is a generous cut of meat but definitely over seasoned as it  is completely impossible to taste the steak through the encrusted portion.  Good service.  Maybe a little overpriced for what you get But definitely not disappointing.</body>

        <body>Where St. Elmo&apos;s is tight on space and seating close, their sister property is nice and the food is just as good.  Plus it is a beautiful restaurant. But don&apos;t kid yourself it is still pricy.  A steak, shrimp cocktail and a couple beers is $75.   But worth it.  Have fun</body>

        <body>Service was exceedingly pushy and tried to sell unwanted items and liquor. My seared tuna entree was so hot with ginger and wasabi sauce it hurt to swallow it. Couldn&apos;t eat it. Was not impressed with anything but the salads . . . They were spectacular.</body>

Very helpful with recommendations regarding food and cocktails.  Very personable and most of all, fun. Thanks for helping us celebrate this milestone.</body>

        <body>H&amp;I was really good, as always. Never a bad moment at the bar listening to Ray Charles. It has become pretty touristy, however, and so there is a constant stream of larger groups + parents and kids. If you glance around during a cynical moment, it almost has the feel of Denny&apos;s. Still, good food and excellent service.</body>

        <body>Very well known for their shrimp cocktail was superb and opened up the sinuses. Great yellow fin tuna, and an excellent pork chop dinner. The only minus is that the tables are all very close so it is not a place for a quiet, romantic dinner.</body>

        <body>We left less than impressed with a restaurant we were excited to try. The best part of our dining experience was the waiter. He was very knowledgeable of the menu including the gluten-free menu. He was polite and our glasses were never empty.  I just don&apos;t see the thrill of the restaurant or food compared to the price. We have tried restaurants with much better flavor and menu choices and paid the same if not more. We have also visited restaurants with the same experience and paid less. Menu choices are average, meat was dry or over seasoned, side items are not exciting nor is there much from which to choose. We love to try different restaurants and don&apos;t mind paying for our experience. But H&amp;I fell short. We are in no rush to return.  The hostess deserves a great deal of praise as well. I know they have a thankless job. We had reservations for 6:30. We called to get in early and they accommodated us without hesitation. They were courteous both on the phone and in person.

        <body>This was a business dinner and everything was great.  All enjoyed their meals that ranged from Filets to a Vegan dish.  The only down-side was the waiter was soft spoken and had to ask her to repeat the night&apos;s specials a couple of times.  While she was young and learning she had a friendly smile and tried hard to serve us.</body>

        <body>As usual, Harry and Izzy&apos;s delivers a great experience and shrimp cocktail that will clear sinuses. This has become as much an Indy icon as is St. Elmo&apos;s. Together they represent Indy well and provide a great place to eat, drink , and enjoy. Awesome bar!</body>

        <body>Next time I go, I will not order the filet mignon as I did this time.  The filet was acceptable, but I would expect it to be sensational for this type of dining experience. The sides were very good, the caesar salad was perfect. The service was spectacular for a very busy Easter with a large event in town. Next time, I will order appetizers and go something off of the more eclectic menu than that traditional steak fare. I was disappointed a bread was not offered, but one side was included with the steak.</body>

        <body>Harry And Izzy&apos;s manager came out b/c of allergies - this is normal from what they said. Was very good food - expensive, but good. Filet was very good - the Izzy Style Sirloin was VERY peppery, but good. The St. Elmo&apos;s shrimp has a TON of horseradish - will clean out your sinuses.</body>

        <body>I dined here with a group and everyone ordered something different from the menu. This is a classic steakhouse, so there were no gastronomical surprises, but that&apos;s what we wanted. We shared the calamari appetizer and the self-proclaimed &quot;famous&quot; shrimp cocktail. Both were very good. Those who ordered steaks were pleased that they were prepared as they had been ordered, and were very tasty. A few ordered fish and were also happy. We all felt that the meal was very satisfying and we have nothing to complain about at all.</body>

This was my husbands first time and he was really impressed with the food.  We had the slab bacon appetizer and it was fantastic.  Steaks were cooked just right and even great the next day as lunch.  I would recommend.</body>

        <body>I rarely spend $100.00 for one dinner out - but annually my best friend and I try to do something special to celebrate Christmas.  We were running a little late!  The Devour Downtown menu was very good and just because the price was lower didn&apos;t affect the quality of our meal.  Enjoyed the reduced priced wine too!  Love the sitting downstairs and we opened the blinds to watch the fluffy snow.  Our server was very good and didn&apos;t hurry the three of us - as we were very chatty!</body>

        <body>This was my husband and I first visit to Harry&apos;s and Izzy&apos;s.  Everyone recommended the shrimp and we were not disappointed.  The steak was excellent and tender.  The service was spot on.  I was expressed with the ability to provide dining space for large groups.</body>

        <body>Everyone we came in contact with was courteous, professional and made us feel glad to be there. It was a pleasant experience from the time we came in the door to the time we left . There is not one aspect that I would talk negative about.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. (For me it was pricey but  well worth it.)</body>

        <body>We were in Indy for the NCAA championships in the sport of swimming. We had a group of 13 and made a reservation. The final night went a bit long, so needed to push back the time - very accommodating for us and moved the time back when requested. Had a great spot for the team and staff. Proceeded to have a great meal with perfect steaks, and service was outstanding. I have been to Harry and Izzy&apos;s many times in a small group but not one this large. They handled it superbly. Great time by the student-athletes.</body>

        <body>I was taking my mother to Harry &amp; Izzy&apos;s for dinner as my Christmas present for her. I had asked that we have a table away from the outside doors since she is 81 and doe not like being cold. We were seated in a corner next to the huge window that had a cold breeze coming off the street. Strike one. My mother ordered a Caesar salad that had very little dressing on it. Strike two. My pork chops were dry and overcooked, My potato pancakes were wafer thin and void of flavor. The applesauce was in a dish the size of a quarter and I had more sour cream in the same size dish. I felt that since I had not ordered a cocktail or wine with my meal that the waiter felt that he did not need to wait on us as he was everyone around us. Strike three. I am not the type of person who brings my dissatisfaction at the time to the attention to the management. This establishment asks for top money for it&apos;s product then it should provide top service and top product without my advice. I am one of sixteen chil</body>

        <body>I liked the merlot by the glass.  The beet salad was excellent.  Try not to fill up too much on the hot fresh bread!  As I wasn&apos;t that hungry, I ordered the prime rib pizza and it was really good, different, pieces of prime rib with horseradish sauce on thin pizza crust.</body>

        <body>My husband and I chose this for our wedding anniversary, and brought along our 11 year old daughter. This was on 3/14/15. I believe our server was Leslie (very loud, couldnt hear well), and she was AWESOME. We were seated on the third level, and unfortunately for us, so were some folks talking very explicitly about things I didn&apos;t care to hear, let alone an 11 year old. We cut our visit short due to that. That aside, the food was delicious (rolls are to die for), setting was very relaxing visually, and the service was fantastic. I would definitely visit again, hopefully with less rambunctious table neighbors.</body>

        <body>We were in Indy for a Neil Diamond concert at the Fieldhouse -- meaning thousands were in town. Could not get a reservation for Harry&apos;s &quot;sister&quot; restaurant  &quot;St. Elmo&apos;s.&quot;   We were not disappointed about going next door !  The seating was the best -- upstairs away from the madness. We noticed a substantial difference between our location and the 1st level.  Our server was kind, knowledgeable, &amp;  did not rush.  She was spot on about the wildly famous cocktail sauce -- very spicy &amp; has a kick. Same with her recommendations for which steak we would prefer, once we discussed our palate. She did not up-sell, which is refreshing these days.  The food came out promptly,  hot, with plenty of sides.</body>

        <body>As a vegetarian, I was not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised by the separate vegetarian menu for Devour Downtown, which featured not just your boring vegetarian options, but some truly creative and thoughtful entrees that tasted as good as they sounded! There was also a gluten free menu, which impressed me too. I never would have gone here on my own, but I&apos;m glad I got to try it. Hopefully their daily menu is equally veg-friendly.</body>

        <body>My son and I went to the Pacers vs Cavs game Friday night. I reviewed many restaurants to have a really great dinner before the game. Harry and Izzy&apos;s based on atmosphere, menu and location appeared perfect. It was!! We had a wonderful experience, food was exceptional and the staff was very friendly. We had the famous shrimp cocktail and the Bacon Slab two completely unique appetizers. Both excellent. Also two filets that were some of the best I&apos;ve had...honestly, I&apos;ve had many from which to compare. Service was tremendous, we never had to ask for anything, very attentive. A plus rating. We will be back</body>

        <body>Great service and ambiance.  Hostesses and servers were efficient and friendly.  It was our first time at Harry &amp; Izzy&apos;s and we were hoping for a great steak experience.  I am sure 99% of the time the steaks come out perfect but this time my medium rare Filet Mignon and my partner&apos;s Lamb chops were more well done that medium rare.  Some times different places have different cooking styles for the term so we asked the server.  He mentioned that it was definitely more medium-well than medium rare.  He immediately offered to bring another steak.  My partner was quiet about her Lamb chops.  I chose not to take the server up on his offer and eat the steak as is.  Later, he surprised us with an offer of free desserts for the over-cook which we took advantage of.  Also the server suggested a nice bottle of wine which balanced quality and price well.    We ordered the green beans and Brussel spouts vegetables as sides.  We like our veggies just barely done at home but these were almost raw ye</body>

        <body>We save Harry &amp; Izzys for special occasions and we not disappointed. We met our daughter &amp; son-in-law and had a nice table and excellent server.  We had a reservation (always recommended) and were shown promptly to our table.  A first for our son-in-law was the shrimp cocktail with the FAMOUS st. Elmo sauce. It is always a treat to watch someone eat the horsey sauce for the first time!  We selected a night during Devour  Downtown -menu options at a fixed price. Three menu selections were available as well as well as their full menu  Many items are ala carte at Harry &amp; Izzys. Be prepared for appetizers, drinks and any upchargers to make your bill $75 per person. That&apos;s why visiting makes it a special ocassion for us.   Indianapolis is fortunate to have many fine dining establishments and Harry &amp; Izzys is definately one of them! ♡♡♡♡</body>

Don&apos;t recommend the spinach and corn salad, too oily on the bacon vinegarette. Not crazy about creme brûlée either, didn&apos;t taste fresh. Loved the potato Ladka with applesauce and sour cream. Sure wish the manager had called me back after calling about the birthday mess up.</body>

        <body>food menu offers choices from mid to high range.   My wife was asked how she wanted her meat done and it came out medium which is undercooked for her tastes.  Noisy 2nd level, made conversation difficult at times.  The Northside location seems to do things a  little better and a bit quieter.</body>

        <body>Returned here 3 years after first experience -- and I would go every time I am in Indianapolis.  Excellent food; same with service.  Walking distance from virtually all the downtown hotels.  Wait staff was friendly, helpful and fun.  Shrimp cocktail was fantastic -- if you like incredibly spice foods.  Great place to celebrate our Blue Devils&apos; NCAA victory!!  Next night, we ate at H &amp; I&apos;s at the airport and it was equally good, although menu, of course, was more limited.  Certainly the best airport food I ever had!</body>

        <body>Everything was good with exception that it was dirty.  The table cloth was stained.  The cups had food on them.  The silverware were dirty also.  I ordered a lemonade and there was something in it.  My spouse ordered tea and it had something in it as well.  We requested a replacement which worked fine, but the waiter, instead of just replacing the tea upon request, tried to justify the reason something was floating in it.   Rather else besides the lack of cleanliness, the service was excellent, and the food was great.  I just hope the plates and soup bowls weren&apos;t dirty prior to them being covered with food.   Due to the cleanliness issue, I probably would not go back.</body>

Highly recoomend their Dirty Martini&apos;s and their Maker Mark concoction ! Right up there with great Chicago Steakhouses !</body>

        <body>We love Harry &amp; Izzy&apos;s and this experience was no exception.  The food is always delicious and we love the atmosphere.    Unfortunately our waitress was sick -  she kept dropping things and getting mixed up, and she kept sniffling her nose.  I know its hard to miss work, but when you work at a nice restaurant you should make sure not to come to work when you&apos;re sick enough to gross out the customers! Even though she was sick, she tried her best and we still received everything in a timely manner.</body>

        <body>Staff accommodated reservation changes from a 2 top to 4, then 5 (we were at a conference and met new friends). Service was spot on yet warm,  authentic, down to earth. Great service on wine recommendations - we were extremely pleased (try the Fog Dog if you like dry). All five of us were impressed with the ahi tuna and the filet with horse radish Gorgonzola butter was divine. For reference I love in Vegas and am a foodie. This place did not disappoint! Thanks to our waiter Dave and all of Harry &amp; Izzy&apos;s!!!</body>

        <body>Friday night busy...table ready exactly on time.  Great wine list. Everyone&apos;s entree&apos;s were perfect.  Server Tamara answered all questions...she really knows the menu and took very good care of our needs. Another great meal and dining experience at H&amp;I.  Looking forward to a return soon.</body>

        <body>We went to this restaurant during the NCAA tournament so we expected it to be busy and it was, which was no problem because we had plenty of time before the game.  Two of our entrees came and the waitress told us the other two had fallen on the floor so they were remaking them.  45 minutes later they showed up.  HORRIBLE.  It&apos;s obvious they put them at the back of the cue of the other diners.  They offered us free dessert (would have rather had entrees on time) and then charged us for it afterwards.  Food was ok, not great.  I would never go back.</body>

        <body>I facilitate an Agent of the Month program for a large insurance company in the area.  Every month,  I&apos;ve chosen to provide a lunch at a Harry &amp; Izzy&apos;s location with their Agency Manager and their District Manager as the agents&apos; incentive to win.  The food is always wonderful, the service is always exceptional, and the atmosphere is always perfect!  The agents always rave about the experience to the rest of their fellow agents in the county, and now they are all much more fiercely competitive about winning.  Thank you for providing such a wonderful experience, time and time again.</body>

        <body>I am a regular at Harry and Izzy&apos;s whenever i am in Indy.   Always great food and great service.   The only item i wish they woudl serve is St Elmos bean soup.   When they first opened, they could &quot;sneak&quot; over a bowl, but no longer...   I always recomend a mix of the sliders and you cant beat the price.  Of course, the steaks are always outstanding.  I just had a group from Texas in for dinner and they all said this was the best steak they ever had.  It pained them to say steak was better than Texas, but they did....</body>

        <body>We chose this restaurant because it is a sister company to St Elmos.  This was a busy weekend and we could not get into St Elmos.  Harry and Izzy&apos;s has a very similar menu to St Elmos and even has their world famous cocktail sauce!</body>

        <body>That was some of the most efficient service I had in sometime so please thank Jennifer for me.  I also thought the strip steak was perfectly done at medium rare and I enjoyed the mashed potatoes. I sort of had to eat fast as our group needed to get to the Duke Wisc game and we were short on time but the food was excellent.  Thanks.</body>

        <body>Food was awesome!  We were celebrating our Anniversary and they actually put decorations on the table before we got there!  Such a cool &quot;touch&quot; to our dinner.  Waiter explained everything about food and was always &quot;spot on&quot; in paying attention to what we needed.  Most places these days you have to ask for everything.  Not here!  Would recommend and will return!!</body>

        <body>It just didn&apos;t live up to my memory of previous years visiting for business dinners at Harry and Izzy&apos;s. Shrimp cocktail is still excellent, but my bone-in ribeye flavor was pretty flat and the sauted mushrooms were completely flavorless. Bread pudding dessert was excellent as was service. For spending nearly $100/person I expect a better food experience. I&apos;ll give St. Elmo&apos;s a try next year and see if that is better.</body>

        <body>This was my first time here for dinner although I had for business lunch several times. The beet salad once again did not disappoint.  It was so delicious! I had the steak which was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  My husband had the salmon Oscar which he really enjoyed. We were here in Christmas Eve so it was a little busy but or server did a great job keeping up. They were definitely staffed appropriately.  Will definitely be back again but likely for lunch again.</body>

        <body>We had an early reservation as we were heading to the theater that night. There were only two of us and the place did not appear crowded except for the bar which had a nice after work crowd. We walked past many empty tables and were seated in the midst of several ( at  least 6 ) parties of seven or more people. It was almost impossible to hear ourselves or our waitress. While the food was fine and the service was excellent I won&apos;t rush back there any time soon. Hard to enjoy dinner when you can&apos;t speak to your dinner companion</body>

        <body>Slapped the Shrimp Cocktail on a few virgins and watched them tear up!  Steaks were terrific and the service level followed.  Take a group and you can have conversation.  Not something you can do at St. Elmo&apos;s unless you have a private room.</body>

        <body>Very slow service. Reservation at 6:45 and didn&apos;t get our food until 8!!! Then sat waiting on our check with credit cards in table. Finally, after 20 min we had to as for it.  Was surprised at the number of small children. We went for a kid free night and there were several loud babies and toddlers running around with glass cups!!! Yikes  Food was great</body>

        <body>The  atmosphere was as expected. The service was attentive  with the team approach.  The beet salad was quite clunky with large chunks of beet, form what must have been one pound originals.  Most pieces needed to be cut at least two times before consuming.  The wedge salad and  onion soup were both delightful.  The bread service was an afterthought after the entrees arrived.  The new york strip special ( dry aged ) had the extra flavor, but lacked the tenderness of a prime cut.  The scallop dish and shrimp allfredo were well received.  Based on the evening prices, I think a luncheon stop will be better served the next time I visit downtown Indy.  Definitely worth another try though.</body>

        <body>My best friend chose to try Harry &amp;  Izzy&apos;s for her birthday. The server came across less than friendly. At one point she took a couple of our wine glasses and used them for the table next to us, never asking if we might at some point want to use them.  My boyfriend and each ordered sandwiches. My fries were warm but not hot and my chicken club sandwich&apos;s bacon was virtually raw. My boyfriend&apos;s burger was missing the bacon he ordered and was charged for. We were never asked if our food was good/acceptable.   Two of our party told us they&apos;d visited your establishment before and that our experience was unusual. For the reputation the restaurant has though our first time visiting experience was not one that makes me want to come running back.</body>

        <body>Food was good. But the filet was a disappointment. For $31.00, very plain, no flavor and a bit over cooked for medium-rare. Sea scallops and fettuccine were both good.</body>

        <body>on being told of a food allergy of someone in our party, our server Phillip told us that the manager would be told and that they have a special policy for this problem. The Manager came and was fantastic. from the chef to the server everyone was made aware . We were amazed at the great attention to our needs and the food was delicious.</body>

        <body>We again dined at Harry  &amp; Izzy&apos;s and once again, a fantastic experience.  From the friendly hostesses to the knowledgeable and gracious server, Raul to the kind Manager who personally assured me that my severe peanut allergy would not be compromised by my order, it confirms why we return often.  Shrimp Cocktail (and its intense heat) never disappoints.  I encourage all varieties of &quot;Sliders&quot;, Garbage Salad, Seared Ahi and the Filet.  A new find:  ORDER the Brussel Sprouts.  They are not your mama&apos;s Brussel Sprouts.  Best I have ever had with reduced balsamic seasoning and bits of bacon.  I may have them as my entree next time!!  Just amazing.  Thanks for the wonderful dinner.  My entire family loved it.</body>

        <body>We stopped in for a late lunch and we were extremely happy with our food and service. Tried the lunch special, Demi glazed fettuccini with sun dried tomatoes and prime rib. This was one of the best pastas I&apos;ve ever had, it was absolutely amazing! Highly recommend this dish.</body>

        <body>My wife and I have enjoyed Harry &amp; Izzy&apos;s many times before. This past Saturday was my wife&apos;s birthday and we decided to again go to Harry &amp; Izzy&apos;s. The food was outstanding as always. The service, however, fell short of the usual standards this time. The restaurant was busy and the wait staff appeared to be very flustered and were rushing tables. Service was also a bit sloppy this time: Sloppy pours with the water resulting in water splashing, water on our plates, water on the table; Wine pours were rushed and not neat; Our server, while very polite, appeared to be going through the motions and not really in tune with US - we were asked the same question 3 separate times at one point.</body>

        <body>Ask for a medium to medium well steak with just a hint of pink. First serving was medium rare, (red). Second trip back it was 75% pink. Told the waiter to get the pink out and sure enough, well done and scorched on the last try. Lost the taste and hurt my teeth. I will definitely let people know my experience and to find somewhere else to eat.</body>

        <body>Their shrimp cocktail is a must!  So is the bread pudding!  The prime r&amp;r b sandwich was great and so was the lamb.  Our server very knowledgeable about the restaurant and its history.</body>

        <body>I opted for a smaller dinner, wedge salad, a couple of their sliders (Filet and Meatball) and a plate of fried green tomatoes.  While one of my tablemates chose a Ribeye and the must-do shrimp cocktail.  It doesn&apos;t matter what size dinner you&apos;re in the mood for, you can find great variety in this menu and not feel like you&apos;re missing out.</body>

        <body>We were in town for the IHSAA State Basketball Finals. We started as a party of 6 at 3PM; changed to 4PM and then back to 3PM as a party of 13. The hostess couldn&apos;t have been more willing to assist us.  We were seated at 3PM in an area that provided us with ample room. The waiter was great. He handled the large party primarily unassisted. Everyone&apos;s order was perfect, our glasses were never empty and he had to bills to the correct parties with no problem. We were in and out in an hour and a half. We didn&apos;t feel rushed at all.  The food was fabulous as usual.  Don&apos;t forget to have a shrimp cocktail! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT</body>

        <body>Very solid entrees off a limited menu.  Two of us had the Ahi Tuna Special which was delicious!  Obviously, you must have the St. Elmo&apos;s Shrimp cocktail, but they have a 10 piece cocktail that is perfect for sharing at table for four.  Enjoyed the meal.  Well be back as part of the downtown Indy rotation.</body>

        <body>The staff was kind.  But seemed understaffed.  We were never served any bread but the tables around us were.  Some of the sides were cold.  Temps tire in the restraint was cold.  Kinda bummed after so much planning ahead for a romantic night for wife.</body>

        <body>Harry and Izzys is a hot spot if you are looking for local cuisine.  The calamari is to die for as well as the miniature filets. The service is great and the servers are accommodating.  The steak is cooked to perfection. Enjoy.</body>

        <body>We had friends in from out-of-town for special occasion. Every course was delicious and the service was great. The famous shrimp cocktail, salads, baked ravioli, steaks, salmon. Harry &amp; Izzy&apos;s is pricey, but it&apos;s perfect for a night to remember.</body>

        <body>SO the atmosphere and the service were top notch...too bad I can&apos;t say the same for the food. My girlfriend had the tenderloin which was way over cooked to the point of the breading being burnt. I had the prime rib sandwich and there was very little meat and what there was included a sizeable amount of fat. Now I know prime rib can be fatty but combined with not much meat, it left very little to eat. As always, the shrimp cocktail was delicious. In fairness, we saw other menu items come out that looked much better than ours...maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. As these prices, it shouldn&apos;t really matter though.</body>

        <body>We were a party of 8 ladies...out to celebrate a birthday.  Great service...good food...and a round table so we could talk for 3 hours!   We found our waiter very accommodating and patient.  We were not rushed, but well taken care of.</body>

        <body>Have enjoyed Kuletos for years, but unfortunately no more - food was sadly uninspired with poor presentation and even worse flavors - clearly no one in the kitchen is doing anything more than filling orders.  sad to see how far this once great place has moved down.</body>

        <body>Went for our 20th Wedding Anniversary, and brought our own bottle of wine, the corkage fee was 20 dollars which is reasonable for a high end restaurant.  The food prices were reasonable, and food was great.  The bruschetta was a great starter, and the Salmon special was good as well, the portions are on the small side, but the prices reflect that and it gives you an opportunity to taste more of the food.</body>

        <body>we arrived 13 min early for a 5pm resvr and were told to come back at 5pm. the host looked nervous/stressed. he did not say they would call out our name at 5pm he just said come back at 5pm. I felt like leaving right there and then. Me and my girlfriend came back at 5pm and they still were not ready for us so we sat down in a booth across  from the bar to wait and it smelled awful. a strong &quot;vinegar&quot; smell overwhelmed us like the table was cleaned with a dirty cloth. the hostess came to us and greeted us and asked if we were happy in the booth and i said &quot;no. i do not want to eat in the bar area.&quot; she asked where i would like to sit. i&apos;ve never been to this restaurant before. i looked at her surprised. i told her I made resrvatns for 2 and thats it. she offered the dinning room after that. (weird?). another not so elegant element was overhearing the bus boys cursing in spanish. i don&apos;t speak spanish but i do know the bad words. not so charming. our &quot;bread man&quot; passed us up to serve ot</body>

        <body>We got seated at the best table in the back and is big enough for 6 people, request it if you have four to six people.  The food is great,  especially loved the beet salad.  I really appreciate the wonderful and attentive service which puts this restaurant in the top choices for fine dining.</body>

        <body>I loved the grilled radicchio appetizer but, was a little disappointed in my dinner entree.  I chose the short rib risotto.  It was a little too fatty from the ribs so I couldn&apos;t finish it.  Ambiance and service were great though!  I will definitely go back and try something else for dinner.</body>

        <body>Kuleto&apos;s is a great place to eat, but don&apos;t go there unless you have plenty of time. We went for lunch on a Monday and had to wait over 45 minutes for our food. The food, when it came, was delicious. However, our server was nowhere to be seen before that. The service can stand to be upgraded. For now, i havé to give Kuleto&apos;s only 3 stars until the service improves.</body>

        <body>I have been to Kuletos many times - it was one of my favorite places to eat.  However, this last time was a huge disappointment. The food was terrible. I ordered a Cesar Salad and the brought me a plate filled with Frissee - I hate Frissee - Who puts Frissee in a Cesar Salad?? I complained and they did not take it off the bill.  Shame on them. I then had the Tagliatelle with Crab - it was too salty. The wine was good though not from anything the restaurant did. All in all it was a terrible meal and, unfortunately I won&apos;t go back there again.</body>

        <body>Nice atmosphere, small portions, very small wine serving at higher prices. Most dishes you have to order sides as entrees do not come with anything.  Services was good but it is a very busy restaurant.  Good place to go for cocktails.</body>

        <body>The dining experience was very special because our waiter was the best waiter on the planet. He was training some one, and it would take a lifetime to learn what this waiter knew. He knew every dish inside and out, how it was prepared, what he though about it, what diners thought about it, his knowledge as textbook best water practices. Always checking on all his tables, timing was excellent  of course it was important to have excellent food, and it was. Classic Italian, presented and served top ketch. Good value, in a nice space. Don;t miss out.</body>

        <body>I have been going to Kuletos for well over 15 years and it was one of my favorite restaurants in Union Square.  Sadly, that is no longer the case.  I took a friend, who was visiting from Orange County, to dinner there on 3-5-15 and was mortified to have exposed her to such poor service and terrible food.  The waiter was totally checked out and not attentive, at all.  Both tables on either side of us were seated well after us and their orders were taken first and, after I could finally get our waiters attention to take our order, both tables were served shortly thereafter.  I ordered the risotto, which had been my favorite dish at Kuletos for over 15 years, was absolutely terrible.   The shrimp were small, overcooked and tough; the scallops were mediocre; and the rice was not properly cooked.  My friend&apos;s food was also overcooked and looked terrible.  The table to our left had ordered the same dish as her&apos;s and it had the same overcooked appearance.  It took 3 requests to get our Tiram</body>

        <body>Disappointment would best describe our last visit.  We have always looked forward to having lunch at Kuleto&apos;s whenever we are in the city and especially prior to attending the theater. This visit left us    slightly shocked when our server was less attentive than we expected and the crab salad that my partner ordered would be best described as &quot;inadequate&quot;. Seems as though the $21 salad had about $6 worth of product consisting of very large pieces of different lettuces, very little crab meat and a bland dressing. A sorry salad to say the least!</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve never had a waiter @ Kuleto&apos;s  (after telling them NO Bacon in Salad) serve it that way anyway, then recommend the fish special, serve half the fish cooked &amp; the other half partially raw. When we sent it back it was brought back all mutilated &amp; massacred with half the fish missing. We didn&apos;t have to pay for the $9.00 Salad but he (The Waiter) still charged us for the $32.00 nightly fish special. I&apos;ve alway&apos;s been satisfied with my experiences &amp; eating at Kuleto&apos;s until Now!</body>

        <body>What a great experience we had at Kuletos!  We arrived a bit early and were okay with going to the bar area, but they seated us early and were very attentive.  The bread basket is wonderful - 4 different choices.  We shared an appetizer...the bruschetta with fig, burrata, smoked prosuitto and arugula was wonderful.  We all enjoyed our entrees tremendously and the wine was great too.</body>

        <body>Hard to beat this place for a warm meal on a cold winter&apos;s evening in central SF. Fried calamari for appetizer was crispy, tender, and light; braised short ribs entree was full of flavor. I was equally impressed by samples of my wife&apos;s salad (chosen from a range of inventive options) and her delicious pasta dish. I never miss a chance to eat at Kuleto&apos;s when in SF.</body>

        <body>Our service was great, he made sure of it. He explained our food special menu with ease. Recommended some great tasting wine. However, our food wasn&apos;t so great. The pasta and salmon both were under cooked. If i wanted some raw salmon, i would go sushi, not Italian.</body>

        <body>We hadn&apos;t been to Kuleto&apos;s for quite some time.   I&apos;m happy to report the quality is still very good.    The place is always packed with tourists and conventioneers so if you are a native just be forewarned.  Wait staff is very cordial considering they do have to put up with so many tourists.  It&apos;s a little pricey but the quality of the food is good.</body>

        <body>We are foodies from NYC and whenever we visited San Francisco in the past, Kuleto&apos;s was on our go-to list for at least one meal... Sadly during our meal at Kuleto&apos;s last week we realized that something has change since our last visit the food was bad and so was the service, the entire vibe at the restaurant was off. Sad really, because this was a well-run classy restaurant but clearly no more...</body>

        <body>I knew it was probably a crapshoot to go here, but I fondly remember Kuleto&apos;s from 20 and even 10 years ago, so I thought I&apos;d try it. Wrong. The food took bland and dull to a new low, the selection for wine by the glass was so-so, and  ambiance in the hotel lobby extension is, how should I put this... oh, so hotel lobby. Service was ok, but nothing to write home about. The high point of the evening was the flatbread in the breadbasket, and even that was hit or miss as some of it was burnt.  They&apos;re certainly not worth the prices they are charging and they are obviously surviving on tourists and hotel guests. It&apos;s a shame, because they were really good at one time.</body>

        <body>We had a 6:30 reservation on a Friday and they took is in a few minutes early. Asked if we were attending a play and from that point forward our waiter timed everything perfectly. From drinks through dessert, everything was served at a perfect pace. The entrees were great and our waiter brought us a triplet of gelato flavored since we couldn&apos;t decide on one. Excellent service.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Kuleto&apos;s several times so suggested going there for an early dinner after seeing a play.  Restaurant is lovely.  Service is very good.  Noise level is such that you can talk and be heard.  Food was very good except that some of the shrimp in the risotto were over cooked so they were rubbery.  One of my friends had one of the specials, sea bass, and a couple of pieces of the kale in the dish were inedible.  Server did bring some different greens to compensate.  Instead of getting cooked greens, the greens brought were cold so she declined them.</body>

        <body>We ordered a small half  bottle of wine to start and were told after several minutes they were out of it.  We asked about the same wine in a full size for a better price and was told it could not be done.  I then asked if I could order a spaghetti pasta in place of angel hair and was told pasta can not be switched. When one of our entrees arrived cold, I asked for the manager.  After letting him know about all of this, he informed us that they absolutely swap pastas and he didn&apos;t think they were sold out of the half bottle of wine we requested.  He returned with the wine and then prepared the spaghetti as I had requested.  As it turns out, the pasta was terrible.  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was extremely bland.  It was a terrible dish.  Two days later, I was on Open Table looking at my reservations and noticed I did not receive credit for our 1000 point dinner at Kuleto&apos;s.  After calling the restaurant, I was told I never had a reservation there.  I was told to make a lunc</body>

        <body>Kuleto&apos;s is a perennial favorite of ours as we usually dine there before attending the A.C.T. productions.  This last time was slightly disappointing but NOT because the food or service were any less outstanding but rather because we were seated in the bar section, where the booths are less comfortable and the noise was extreme.  Usually we don&apos;t have this issue.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been coming to Kuleto&apos;s and enjoying it for years.  This time, however, both food and service were pretty awful.  Our party of 8 were not served dishes at the same time.  Wine came long after the food was served.  My pork chop was overcooked and served in an ill-conceived, cloyingly sweet maple sauce that rendered it inedible.  The gnoccicini served with it were grey, shriveled, and glutinous.  Half of my party were satisfied with their food, though not the service, the other half were disappointed as well.</body>

        <body>We opted for New Year&apos;s Eve dinner here prior to heading over to the Symphony Hall for a concert. We&apos;d read many good comments about this venerable eating establishment and we enjoyed it very much, though thought Scala&apos;s (up the street and very similar) outdid them in some areas. The bread baskets are fun and tasty.   We were uninspired by the cocktail menu (Sacramento really does a better job than the city in this area, surprisingly). The server made a suggestion for a mandarin cosmo that was quite acceptable.  The garden salad had fresh greens, but was pretty boring, and Scala&apos;s outdid them there. The butternut squash ravioli were very tasty, but again, Scala&apos;s pesto ravioli&apos;s with lemon cream sauce outdid them. The gnocchi with brussel sprouts was excellent and unexpected.   As usual, San Francisco still does not do a great job with veggie options (too many tourists, I guess) but we were fed and it was very good. We did not have time for dessert. Service was quick, a little bit too</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Kuleto&apos;s several times. This last time was awful. Very overpriced, poor service and totally rigid  policies (against making any changes to their standard preparation of a dish). It was sort of take it or leave it. Everything has pancetta in it (please, enough already!). The Caesar salad was 50% radicchio, which is very bitter.  Menu said there would be radicchio but who knew it was over half the salad?! Too bad because I liked the dressing on the romaine part of the salad. We could never find our waiter when we needed him. Just a bad experience. And we felt ripped off.</body>

        <body>We were looking for a Union Square restaurant that actually served great food, not just filling the bellies of tourists. Kuleto&apos;s was not our first choice but it will be in the future! Everything from service to menu to ambiance was excellent! Every person in our party of four thoroughly enjoyed their selections for dinner. Kuleto&apos;s will be our &quot;go to&quot; place pre-and post theater in Union Square from now on!</body>

        <body>I have been a patron of Kuleto&apos;s for the past 24 years and I have to say the last two times have been disappointing. The grilled radicchio (always my favorite) should be called burnt...in addition, neither the marinade nor the sauce was up to standard! It reminds me of the time the chef decided to put a lemon sauce in place of the pesto sauce and the regulars protested. Our server was a nice guy but completely overwhelmed. We finally had to say that we had play tickets (which we did) to get any attention. Both these experiences occurred in the dining room, once with a party of 17, the second time with me and my husband. That said, the service at the bar with Jim is always excellent and we have never had a bad dining experience there.</body>

        <body>One of the best for Italian food in Union Square (and SF for that matter).  Perhaps not as edgy as SPQR, but sometimes that&apos;s a good thing.  Excellent food and service that can&apos;t be beat.</body>

        <body>Our experience was as expected...great food, good service and vintage ambience.  Our waiter was particularly helpful about describing the specials and with helping to select a new and unknown wine.  He was also not pushy about having starters and let us know that the dishes were substantial.  As a result, we had a delicious and satisfying meal, shared a bottle of wine and a dessert, and left comfortably full.  The spinach and trumpet mushroom risotto was flavorful with the freshness of spring.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed the petrale sole.   We will keep returning to this favorite spot when we come to San Francisco.</body>

        <body>I was pleased to go to the restaurant and my girlfriend and I really really liked it. That was a surprise as Powell Street is pretty seedy and up until now we have not found a place to eat dinner near A.C.T. This place was not cheap but the food was first rate and the location was perfect for us; halfway between BART and A.C.T. We will eat here again as the menu is extensive and we want to try everything on it.</body>

        <body>My best friend and I have been meeting at Kuleto&apos;s every Christmas Eve for lunch for the past 10+ years.  The overall experience has always been 4-5 star worthy, except for 2013.  The service was exceptionally poor from both the hostess and the waiter, and the food was just &quot;okay&quot;.  The experience was so disappointing that neither one of us returned during the calendar year of 2014.  We hesitated to return on Christmas Eve 2014 but decided to give the restaurant one more chance to redeem itself in our eyes.  Fortunately for us (and the restaurant), the overall service and food had returned to the high standard we had come to expect from Kuleto&apos;s.  Once again I can highly recommend Kuleto&apos;s to my friends and family as my favorite Italian restaurant in the Union Square/Embarcadero area of the City.</body>

        <body>I have been to this restaurant more than any other in the City when I visit San Francisco. I&apos;ve eaten here for breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks. It&apos;s conveniently located after shopping till you are dropping. I have also stayed at the Villa Florence a couple of times so taking the elevator to a meal seems like a pretty good option when taxis are hard to come by on busy nights. Our waiter was helpful, the vibe was lively, food and wine more than satisfying. I&apos;m not sure but I think this is Pat Kuleto&apos;s first restaurant and it seems to have held it&apos;s own against new up-and-coming hipsters……an oldie but a goodie.</body>

The service was attentive and just friendly enough to be pleasant without being intrusive.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others visiting San Francisco.</body>

        <body>Kuleto&apos;s on Powell St can&apos;t be matched for its cuisine, ambience and service. The ahi tuna is my favorite so far, but that will change when I try something new next time. And the wine list is fabulous, both domestic and international. All in all, the entire dining experience was wonderful!</body>

        <body>Walking into the restaurant you could feel the energy of the city.  We were seated on time for our reservation.  Our server was very engaging and menu savvy.  The food presentation was beautiful and the flavor of the dishes did not disappoint.  The salmon special was cooked to perfection.  We lingered after our meal and was pleased to see our server made sure we were taken care of well after our last cup of coffee.  Wonderful place to dine.  We will return.</body>

        <body>Kuleto&apos;s was not the best dining experience for my guest and me mainly because of an odd, awkward and off-putting waiter.  He was not rude, but strange, thus clouding my judgment.  Overall the food was good, but nothing stood out.  My field greens salad was just that, and lots of it.  In fact, the salad was too large for an appetizer portion.  The vinaigrette dressing was a bit to oily, as if the ration of oil and vinegar was off.   I ordered the stuffed sole.  Again it was well prepared, but nothing outstanding.  My dinner companion enjoyed a different salad. Her steak was cooked perfectly and we didn&apos;t have dessert.  If the waiter hadn&apos;t tainted my experience, this restaurant might have received higher ratings.</body>

        <body>We always spend our anniversary dining at Kuleto&apos;s and have always had a wonderful experience except this time.  Our server Ben was horrible.  He made us &amp; all his other tables feel rushed.  If you go, make sure you don&apos;t get Ben as your server.</body>

        <body>Despite an attentive and kind server this chaotic, noisy spot disappointed with everything put on the table from the excessively sour, watery cocktail to the cold (but supposed to be warm) appetizer to the tepid parts sheets stuck together with sauce thrown atop. Such a drop off from the past, the volume of activity seems to overwhelm hosts and kitchen. Tourists and dense businessmen seem happy but local foodies should avoid. So many better options to be had. Won&apos;t be back...</body>

        <body>We have been eating here for years and have always had an excellent meal.  Whether for dinner or lunch, you can&apos;t go wrong. Snag on of the two window tables so you can people watch while eating...very entertaining.   And they take reservations!</body>

        <body>It was good but probably not good enough to go back. When we got there there were not many people  there and yet it took quite awhile to get our food. The Mahi Mahi luncheon special was very good as well as the salad and ricotta cake that came with it. The hanger steak salad was also good however the spaghetti with the GIANT meatball was not very good mainly due to the very firm meatball that was just not appetizing.</body>

        <body>Maybe it was just an off night, because we&apos;ve had better meals at Kuleto&apos;s before.  However, they had a sea bass special that I ordered.  The fish was so over cooked and dried out that they should have been ashamed to serve it.  The kitchen needs to spend more attention to details like that.</body>

        <body>Kuleto&apos;s is my go-to place, lunch or dinner, when I&apos;m in the City. Whether it&apos;s lunch with a friend, a special occasion or showing SF off to out of town friends, it never disappoints. I have tried other downtown restaurants, but always return to Kuleto&apos;s. The menu is varied, so that one can order a full meal or a selection of appetizers and sides. And the specials are always interesting and seasonal. They make everything there, salumi, bread ( a lovely selection arrives at your table), pasta and sauces (duck bolognese... yum) and the best tiramisu on the planet. Wait staff is attentive but not hovering. Kuleto&apos;s is the best in my book!</body>

        <body>Kuleto&apos;s was great. We made a reservation and had a lovely table. The food was very good. All the pasta is made in house.   I would recommend to try it. We had a wonderful experience.</body>

        <body>To start out on a positive note: our server was great as she was timely and everything was served accordingly. However the food was a great disappointment.  We have eaten here every time we have visited SFO in the past.  Three at our table ordered the special for the evening: risotto with lobster.  The risotto was a different kind, making it a surprise as its texture was far from the normal &quot;gooey&quot; consistency prevalent with a classic risotto.  This resulted in the overall taste to be bland and runny.  The lobster meat was unnoticeable and therefore, a major disappointment.  Sadly, a microwave-heated, instant bowl of riceroni would have tasted better.  My chicken was palatable, but a bit on the dry side, laying in a bed of liquid.  Yes, we could have stopped eating and returned the dishes but felt it was best to just carry on.  We were given a dessert and a reduction on our bill (probably standard fare).  Likely, will not return to this restaurant again due to this experience.</body>

        <body>Restaurant is located in the shopping mall. No specific friendly staff but food was really good so I had a good experience. Ordered a small plate Lamb Meatball and that&apos;s was super tasty. Then I tried the Pizza Margherita as a classy and he was excellent as well. A bit expensive restaurant for no scenery or specific seating...</body>

        <body>Great location, connected to a nice boutique hotel.  Northern Italian flavors and specialties were not to my liking.  In my opinion, the flavor combinations were definitely a little different from many other Italian restaurants I have experienced.   The restaurant was crowded so, perhaps, my review of the restaurant may not be as valuable as others.  Not particularly &quot;Kid Friendly.&quot;</body>

        <body>The last time I was at Kuleto&apos;s was nearly 20 years ago and I am impressed that is still has a strong  following.   The food did not disappoint, though not the best or biggest meal around, they do get points for most creative- pasta special was nice and filling. Salmon special with Brussels sprouts and cauliflower was exceptionally tasty. The much-lauded tiramisu was not as special as I recalled. Though the vanilla cream topping was different and nice, it did not knock out socks off.   The room we were seated in was uncomfortably cold and drafty. Hard to have a romantic date and enjoy your food thoroughly when it is so chilly.   The bartender (prior to dinner) was pleasant and accommodating and our waiter worked hard to make our experience a good one.</body>

        <body>Was not expecting thismplace to be so good. Description was good but when you are hungry you are sometimes blind.  Thank god for open table recommending this place to us we would have otherwise never found it.   Everything about the meal and every course was amazing.  The appetizer out of this world (gif, prosciutto bruschetta)  the veal scallopini has you licking the plate.</body>

By luck of the draw we got a table next to the open kitchen.  Turns out this is a very noisy place to eat.  Would that I had been more specific about table choIce.</body>

        <body>Overall we were disappointed . The abienence is always nice and the service this particular time was very good. Our waitperson was very professional, yet friendly and had perfect timing as far as reading when we were ready for the next course. Our issues are with the main entree and the wine list. My husband had the clam linquine which he has had there before, this time there were enough clams, but very little pasta. Pasta is cheap, there is no reason not to serve a decent amount of pasta for the entree.  The other was my veal Scallopini which was very disappointing .  The portions were small, but I would have been ok with that but 2 of the slices were dry and well done. This dish was also very salty, especially the spinach bed it was served on. We didn&apos;t complain because it was our anniversary and we didn&apos;t want to make an issue on that occasion and place a damper on our evening.  The really unfortunate thing is the wine list, the choices and the prices are ridiculous .We each wanted</body>

        <body>Great central location for tired shoppers. Busy time of year, staff was slammed but no real issues.  Food is great, please never remove the grilled radicchio from your menu!</body>

        <body>We were in town for a conference and scrambling to find a place to meet colleagues, and wound up at Kuleto&apos;s bar, Bar Norcini, where we had a nice time. The food was so good that my wife and I thought we&apos;d try the restaurant itself the following night. As we entered, who did we see but the people from the conference we had met at Bar Norcini the night before? Apparently they were equally impressed with the cuisine!   Kuleto&apos;s did not disappoint. We joined the couple and the waiter was very accommodating. He suggested an appetizer that was wonderful and, in fact, everything we ordered was great. Kuleto&apos;s was a great find!</body>

        <body>We arrived 10 minutes late and were told we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. 30 minutes after ordering, the wrong entree was brought to us and the waiter was indifferent. We simply left. This used to be a nice restaurant but it appears to have been spoiled by the economic boom.</body>

        <body>I have eaten at Kuleto&apos;s many times over several decades and, as with this last visit, I have never been disappointed.  It has 3 distinct areas:  the bar scene; the lobby scene; and the fireplace scene.  For romance I recommend the latter.  For family, I recommend the lobby scene.  The food is excellent:  great variety and always well prepared; with prices to match.  Make this a stop on your next visit to the City.  You will not be disappointed.</body>

        <body>We enjoy Kuletos because of its location and that its in the lobby of the Villa Florence where we stay one night per year to visit the city and see the Christmas decorations.  Everything considered it is convenient but the menu is limited and the food not exceptional for the money involved.</body>

        <body>With a reservation thru Open Table, our table was waiting for us as we walked in.  Service was  quick with a bit of attitude which was a little concerning.  The waiter did get better as the meal progressed to the point where he was very pleasant.  The wait staff team was very attentive.  The food was very well prepared.  For dessert, we had the tiramisu... well worth the calories :)  We have been to Kuleto&apos;s several times and have never been disapointed.</body>

        <body>Service - Very attentive without being overbearing. One guy was training so he had a shadow. They had a good sense of humor and were polite so that we felt attended to, but casual enough to be comfortable. Timing of drinks, meal, check, were all appropriate.   Food - I had the risotto with scallops and shrimp. AMAZING. Husband had short ribs - can&apos;t speak to the  meat because I didn&apos;t try it, but the potatoes it came with were great. I had the Riesling with my meal and it was really fantastic. They had some yummy sounding desserts, but we were too full. Also, they give you 4 different types of bread to try to start with...I liked the focaccia because of the texture and flavor, and the breadsticks were just good because they added some crunch to an otherwise soft meal. It fills you up though!  Setting - Not super noisy, but not quiet. If you have a hoarse throat, you might be annoyed trying have a conversation here. Bathroom is in the connected hotel lobby, close by so no big deal. Not</body>

        <body>Stayed at the Villa Florence and booked a table at Kuleto&apos;s for dinner before our event.  We were seated fairly quickly and staff was very courteous and prompt with drinks, appetizers, etc.  great suggestions from a knowledgeable wait staff.  Food was amazing and well worth the price, which was in line and not excessive.  We had Veal Scallopini and Saffron Shrimp and Bay Scallop Risotto.  Russian River Valley Chardonnay was very good and the Copa was amazing.  Very intimate seating in the dining room with a lively atmosphere in the bar.  The fireplace in the dining room was gorgeous and the window seat tables looking out on Powell were charming.  We visit the city often and can&apos;t believe we missed this gem.  Can&apos;t wait to come back!</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve eaten at Kuleto&apos;s for New Year&apos;s for the past five years. The key for us was walking distance from our hotel. This was for first year that everything seemed lackluster. Not particularly good service or food. The Caesar salad with radicchio and frisee was bitter and unappetizing. Perhaps this restaurant needs to evaluate its menu and service training and kick it up a notch.</body>

        <body>While the restaurant environment was pleasantly active with nice energy level, and the service was attentive, the food was simply mediocre, making it difficult to recommend this restaurant.  It was not bad in the sense of being marginally edible, but everything was routine at best, mediocre in just about every sense.  So while the rest of the experience would have led to a positive review, the food quality and preparation could just be much better.</body>

        <body>I had the duck breast which came with the cannelloni, and my husband had the short ribs.  Both dishes were very good. We were there to celebrate my birthday, but I was disapointed that they didn&apos;t bring a free desert to share at the end as is typical at other restaurants.  Will not be back for a special celebration to this restaurant for that reason.</body>

        <body>We found this restaurant at the last minute thru Open Table.  We booked 15 min before our time request.  We were seated promptly!  We asked our server for recommendations of both food and wine....and she was spot on!  Risotto was to die for!  The six days we spent in SF, this was the only restaurant we splurged on dessert.....well worth the zillion calories�.  Don&apos;t bypass Kuleto&apos;s if you want authentic Italian food at it&apos;s best.</body>

        <body>It&apos;s been years since we were downtown for dinner, but to convenience friends staying at the  Hilton, we chose it , remembering how good it had been in the past. We weren&apos;t disappointed. Had a great time, from Vincent , our waiter, to the dinner specials in an atmosphere more reminiscent of a European city than San Francisco&apos;s neighborhood hot spots favored by locals in the know, this was a real treat.</body>

        <body>Dined here the night before Valentines since dinner for Valentines Day proper was completely booked.  Granted my request for seating in the dining room (highly recommended unless one does not mind dining next to the bar). I had pasta with Dungeness crab, and my wife had risotto; both were superb.  We split a Caesar salad, which was excellent.  Would recommend splitting since salad portions are very large.  Side of truffle mushrooms was also good. As usual service was excellent.</body>

        <body>A first-time visit to L&apos;Andana will likely not be the last, but for a suburban restaurant, the prices are high. The menu provides limited and fabulous options, and all in our party were quite pleased with what they selected for food and wine. A huge plus is also the layout and spacing of the tables, making for easy conversation and not overhearing neighboring chatter. I wonder if this restaurant is tailored to expense account meals, which would explain the pricing. For a special occasion or if money is no object, L&apos;Andana should be at the top of your list, especially if you&apos;d prefer not to drive to Boston or Cambridge, or find the hassle of parking an obstacle.</body>

        <body>Our first time at the L&apos;Andana was a great experience.  The waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful in explaining the portion sizes and how to order from the menu.  The food was fantastic, and the wine was really good.  I was a little skeptical that the food would be able to match the price, but was pleasantly surprised that it did.  You get a good value for the price.  The dining room was a little on the formal side so I would go here more for a fine dining/special occasion experience, but I will definitely be back.</body>

        <body>L&apos;Andana continues to be a favorite. Food, service, ambiance...superb. They offered a special Valentine&apos;s menu (which I can understand for such a busy night) but I usually find this disappointing at most restaurants. L&apos;Andana did offer choices from their regular menu, however, which worked well for us. We never felt rushed...food was delicious...just a perfect dining experience. Love it!</body>

        <body>After a hectic shopping expedition at the Burlington Mall we settled in to L&apos;Andana for a quiet and relaxing dinner. From apps to desserts nothing failed. Service was front and center with the exception of the hostesses greeting guests. They are for the most part young and are more interested in themselves rather than greeting the guests making you feel welcomed. I find this on every visit but that doesn&apos;t keep me from coming back.</body>

        <body>We have never been disappointed dining at L&apos;Andana, and this time was no exception.  We were greeted warmly, and the four of us were promptly seated and made to feel comfortable.  The service was very attentive and friendly, without hovering, and while the service was prompt we never felt rushed.  Two diners had a red and yellow beet salad as a first course, beautifully arranged, the flavors fresh and luscious with a soft and velvety goat cheese. We had four different entrees: a Tuscan steak (thin but grilled rare as had been requested), salmon served with a black lentil ragout, a Cornish game hen nicely spatchcocked for much easier eating, and a rich rigatoni bolognese, maybe just a little salty for this diner&apos;s taste, but if that&apos;s the only thing you can find to quibble about, well......  Each dish was artfully presented and looked so enticing, I wish I&apos;d sampled all of them!  We wish we&apos;d had dessert - they looked wonderful.  Alas, next time we&apos;ll save room!  We&apos;ll definitely be ba</body>

        <body>My husband and I had dinner on a Tuesday evening at L&apos;Andana to celebrate his birthday.  We were seated in the lovely wine alcove and so many of the staff stopped by the table and wished my husband a happy birthday.  The ambiance was perfect, the wait staff was top-notch, and the food was incredible.  My Caesar salad was so fresh and my husband ate every last bite of his calamari.  We both ordered the veal chops with mushroom Marsala and parmesan polenta.  The veal was out-of-this-world delicious, the polenta was creamy, and the side of asparagus was grilled to perfection.  My husband is a fabulous cook himself, and he said that the entire meal was the best he had ever tasted!  To finish off our meal, my husband chose the chocolate molten cake which was served with a lit candle and &quot;happy birthday&quot; written on the plate in chocolate.  I was so full, that I had to pass on dessert (although I stole a spoonful or two of the creamy vanilla gelato).  If you want a beautiful setting for a sp</body>

        <body>Outstanding food in all categories, from small plates to large and appetizers through dessert, from fish to meat, from spiced to sweets.  Excellent and comfortable service, as well.</body>

        <body>Our experience was disappointing. Brought another couple with us to celebrate an event.  Service was very good but the waitress was trying to up sell us on appetizers and drinks. The food was fair, my wife had scallops that tasted funny. My porterhouse was salty and grizzly. No coffee was offered but the deserts were great. Wish we had a better time for the money we spent, $450.</body>

        <body>L&apos;Andana is one of those locations that you stumble across outside of the core mall area of Burlignton and you are thankful that you did.  It is spacious and has parkign to accomodate groups as well as individuals coming for a night out on the town.  IT is spacious, but in a way that a group can be sitting near you and you can still have a romantic dinner with loved ones.  Our work group of three throroughly enjoyed the food and how it was presented.  The octopus appetizer was fantastic!  Thesalmon and swordfish entrees were mouth watering and a gem.  The hidden surprise was that when I order tea at the end, I asked for honey and found out that L&apos;Andana makes its own honey.  Trust me when I tell you that it was incredible and fresh.  A small note, but definitely hada lasting impression in the area of finds.</body>

        <body>I love this restaurant group and was very unhappy with my first experience there when it opened and only started going back.  I have been impressed every time.  i have done dinner at the bar and a group meal and a private function all were done beautifully!</body>

        <body>Food was very good, however, I wish there was more of a variety.  The appetizer was great, but the choice of entree was Salmon, Steak and Cornish Hen......opted for the steak, which is always a good option.   Would have liked to see a different seafood choice as none of us liked Salmon or Cornish Hen.</body>

        <body>We enjoy the Capitol Grill often, and this was our first trip to L&apos;Andana. The steaks at L&apos;Andana are far superior - better flavor and cooked to perfection. L&apos;Andana is our new favorite special occasion restaurant.</body>

        <body>The food, ambience and staff are all excellent.  I had the Caesar salad and the game hen both were super  delicious.  Husband had the octopus (tasty but slightly chewy) and the veal chop which he loved.   Highly recommended.  So glad we choose this restaurant.</body>

        <body>The appetizer is really good. So is the dessert. We also tried fries and risotto. The fries is really special with cheese. However, the sirloin was kind of overcooked. We ordered one medium and the other medium-well. The former was more like medium-well and the latter was prone to well-done.</body>

        <body>Great white linen dinning.  We ordered eggs beni and pancakes for brunch. Pancakes where great. Beni was average and over cooked.  There is nothing worse then Cutting your egg in half and the yolk not running out.  It was more of a medium poached egg.  When we sent them back the server ask if we would like them more runny?  That&apos;s the whole point!!! Overall slow service not bad but not great just slow.  The manager on duty seamed pretty attentive and did come over after we sent the food back and came back to make sure it was perfect the second time around. I guess I just expected more for the price point. I will not be returning.</body>

        <body>Spacious restaurant with high ceilings makes for a very relaxed, quiet experience. Bar is around the corner in an alcove which also reduces noise in the main dining room.  The menu has a wide variety of choices from steak to seafood to pasta. Everything was excellent and the service was fine.  But, you get what you pay for - it&apos;s expensive.  Definitely an expense account, &quot;we need to close this deal&quot; type of place or for a special occasion with that special someone.  Place for grownups, not for kids.  Literally one minute off of 128 in Burlington.</body>

        <body>Had to ask 3 servers before I got lemon for my water upon sitting down.  After appetizers were served, I waited for a while and finally had to ask for my bottle of wine to be brought out and served.  Had to ask for my water to be refilled a couple of times. Also had to pour my own wine a few times.  Food was not cooked to my specific instructions  and had to be sent back. No consideration was made for this.  Not up to the caliber expected. Have eaten here before, but feel standards have been lowered. Service was disappointing.</body>

        <body>I am a big fan of this restaurant groups restaurants.  Food was very good as always.  Everything was cooked perfectly including the pasta with the bolognese.  The biggest issue was service.   My wife and I ate in courses  - 1st - shared app 2nd - individual app 3rd - dinner and sides.  We ordered wine with every course as well.    As soon as dinner course was served  a larger party sat down next to us and the waitress forgot about us.  Service was good until this point.  We didn&apos;t have drinks and were out of water throughout the dinner course.  I flagged her down after 20 minutes of no checking in to bring an after dinner drink  and the dessert menu and let her know we needed to order something quick.  25 min went by before she came back.  We left at that moment without dessert and paid the bill up front.</body>

        <body>Service and ambiance was very good. Our server was very personable. The cinnamon muffin served first was delicious and a nice touch. We ordered the ricotta appetizer which never arrived  although the server did bring it later with our meal at no charge. We all ordered frittatas  -  2 we asked to be made with egg whites but were not. There were too many mushrooms and they were too chewy and some times woody. The eggs were not cooked through and with the cheese on top made the whole dish oily . We would not order those again.  The pancakes however were light and fluffy and a good choice.   The meal came out very quickly making us feel rushed although there were many empty tables.    We have had dinner at l&apos;Andanas before which was very good. Brunch did not live up to our expectations and we probably would not do it again.</body>

        <body>Lovely surroundings and courteous and friendly staff join with deliciously prepared food to make L&apos;Andana a perfect place to dine. Perfect veal chops, salmon, and rib-eye were the choices when we visited there with friends . Each entree was prepared to perfection, and special needs of one guest with celiac disease were handled with ease. I highly recommend L&apos;Andana for a special night out.</body>

        <body>The food was absolutely fantastic - a bit pricey but very much worth it.  The wine was very expensive - almost no bottles below $50. The big issue is once again the poor seating location with Open Table. You are either next to the bathroom or next to the kitchen. I had the constant view of waiters going in an out of the kitchen. No the best for an intimate dinner. Next time, I will call the restaurant directly as I definitely intend to go back.</body>

        <body>I absolutely love this restaurant! When my husband asked where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner, without hesitation I blurted &quot;L&apos;Andana!&quot; It is always consistently excellent across the board. We started out by sharing a couple of apps, then I had the big portion of lobster w/ pasta, and my husband had Filet Mignon. That pasta was all I can think about before going to bed. I believe I even dreamt about it. We finished off a delicious bottle of Italian red, and shared my birthday dessert. We look forward to our next visit!</body>

        <body>We are big fans of L&apos;Andana--the atmosphere is lovely, the food delectable, and the service always top-notch. I share this sentiment with many of my friends and large family who in turn have become regular patrons. This time I brought a friend for Rhode Island who loved the menu offerings and like the others I have introduced L&apos;Andana to, wants to make the trek again for a fabulous dining experience.</body>

        <body>Everything was absolutely delicious! My only &quot;complaint&quot; (if you can call it that) was that the steak I ordered medium was actually very rare, but I bink it was because everyone else at the table ordered theirs rare, and they probably got mixed up. It happens. I was already so full of the delicious appetizers and sides that it didn&apos;t bother me to only eat the outer portions of the steak that weren&apos;t so rare. If I cared enough I would have just sent it back for a few more seconds on the grill. The waitress was so nice and attentive, I know that was an option.</body>

        <body>I came here with a few friends for brunch.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful - from checking in coats, giving menu suggestions, to promptly tending to our table; all the while, it never felt stuffy or overbearing.  The food was fantastic.  I got the tuscan toast.  We had the doughnuts for the table that were delicious.  Every bite was perfect and each plate more beautiful than the next.  Everyone was extremely happy with the location, food, and service, which is not always easy when dealing with groups.  I can&apos;t wait to go back.</body>

        <body>Another great meal at L&apos;Andana.  We had a great table and a server who understood we were catching up and telling stories.  Hannah was great and knew when to give us time as we chatted. We were SO HAPPY the grilled Brussels sprouts are back!!!  They are amazing and we ordered two side orders of them.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and tasted great.  The desserts - Coconut bread pudding, apple crostada and chocolate crème were all amazing.  We love this place and will be back soon for the Brussels sprouts again soon before they disappear off the menu again.</body>

We decided that it looked like the perfect place. It was! All the staff members were wonderful and gracious, the drinks were very flavorful, and the food was delightful. We will definitely be recommended  this restaurant to others and most surely returning ourselves.</body>

        <body>Not what we expected. I was looking for a place for a nice Sunday dinner (Lunch) for my wife&apos;s birthday for 7 people. When Open Table suggested L&apos;Andana for a 1 PM reservation I went for it. I had been there for dinner and it had been excellent.  I never go to brunch and have no interest in eating breakfast at 1 PM. It never crossed my mind when I made a 1 PM lunch reservation on a Sunday that all they would be serving are breakfast items. The closest we got to a lunch item was &apos;Steak &amp; Eggs&quot;  while the food was excellent one would expect a lunch menu after noon time, and they were open until 2 PM.</body>

The tuna tatare is the best I have ever had. My friends ordered pasta dishes that were authentic simple preparation that shined. Our server, Philamenia, was efficient and a lovely server.</body>

        <body>If you&apos;re looking for an upscale steakhouse/italian restaurant with world-class food and service, look no further. I&apos;ve been here with my family about 10 times, normally for special occasions, as it is a little pricey (but 100% worth it), and we haven&apos;t found better elsewhere. We&apos;re normally much bigger fans of spicy/flavorful/ethnic food, but this Italian steakhouse really gets us to come back again and again. Filet mignon for an entree and the cioccolato for dessert, and you&apos;re golden.</body>

        <body>L&apos;Andana is one of my favorite restaurants as I always find the service and food to be consistent.  I am impressed on a regular basis as they make note of my allergy and always remember to address it, unlike other restaurants that don&apos;t even acknowledge an allergy.  The Restaurant Manager, Hoshang is a gem - he handles everything professionally and goes out of his way to make sure your happy leaving you feeling special.  I look forward to more dinners at this wonderful restaurant.</body>

        <body>We have never been disappointed by the food or presentation here. Sometimes service can be a bit slow but no other complaints. Easier to get reservations here than their Boston restaurants. Excellent wine list with some good buys for those who know their wine.</body>

        <body>We have been to L&apos;Andana before and came again to celebrate a birthday. It was an outstanding evening from the fantastic Fig Vodka cocktail to the heavenly desert. We had the Octopus and Meatball  appetizers and both were excellent. Main courses of Halibut, a special for the night, and Cornish Hen were also outstanding. The wines by the glass were varied and reasonably priced. And with such great service, it couldn&apos;t be any better. We will be back soon!</body>

        <body>Picked L&apos;Andana due to its central location for our party of 6. The restaurant is nowhere near the Burlington Mall which makes it easy to get to and it&apos;s convenient from the highway. The free valet is a nice touch, but feels unnecessary as there is plenty of convenient parking. The hostesses were friendly and attentive and directed our party to the bar until we all arrived which was perfectly fine.  The table we had was comfortable and convenient for a party of 6 and the seating is more than comfortable enough for a long meal. Which in our case was important as it was about 20 minutes before we met the waitress to take our drink order and exactly 1 hour and 15 minutes before we could get her attention enough to get our appetizer and dinner order in. It was a busy Friday night but our waitress was clearly overwhelmed. Our party is pretty laid back and we choose to enjoy the time rather than complain but we were hungry and it was akward how slow the service was, especially as they appea</body>

        <body>I made reservations through OpenTable to eat at L&apos;Andana for my wife&apos;s birthday.  From the complimentary valet parking to the final touch of dessert and everything in between, we rate this restaurant as OUTSTANDING. Everyone was very friendly and the ambiance was quite romantic for this special occasion.  The lighting was just the perfect amount of &quot;dim&quot; and the sofa seating was very comfortable.  Our server, Kelvyn was very polite and knowledgable of the menu and did not hover or rush us in any way.  Yet, he was extremely attentive to us.  The bread and tomato spread to start was delicious as was our starter caesar salads.  We would definitely recommend the Tuscan Steak.  12 ounces of perfection!  And, Kelvyn suggested preparing it medium-rare which is what we both prefer anyway so we were quite pleased with the turn out.  For an upscale restaurant, they did not skimp on portion sizes and you definitely get what you pay for.  Our water glasses remained full throughout the entire serv</body>

Amazing steaks, very good pasta, and it is obvious they are serious about high quality food, and we definitely appreciate that.

The atmosphere and service really made our experience outstanding.  It&apos;s a beautiful dining room which is comfortable and the noise level is low.  The service was excellent.  I would definitely love to go again, just not during restaurant week.</body>

They took the dessert off but not the martini.   Waitress was good not great.  I love this place usually, just a bit of an off this night.  The food was amazing though.</body>

        <body>This restaurant had great ambiance and great waitstaff, we made a reservation and was seated right away on arrival, but felt as though the food was just average. The pricing was not outrageous, but felt as though from the recommendation of many friends, the food was cook well but was just average in taste. I had the chicken and was expecting something special, but the taste was basically ordinary. My husband had the rib eye and that was cooked to perfection and good, but any steak cooked correctly should taste good, and the sides again were lacking the wow factor for the price. But I do have to say the chocolate mousse was out standing and the service was exceptional.</body>

        <body>We love L&apos;Andana and come here for most special occasions. The service was excellent, as usual...attentive without being interruptive. My wife started with the calamari and had the tortellini for her entree. I had the salumi, which I had never had here before, and the veal chop. The single serving salumi was perfect in size and was delicious. The veal chop is always well-prepared and came with a creamy, cheesy polenta. My wife finished with her favorite, the cider donuts, and I had the apple crostini. Just can&apos;t say enough about this place!</body>

        <body>The calamari app and the rigatoni bolognese were fantastic. The molten chocolate cake and apple crisp were terrific. Even the pre-meal bread was amazing. The weak part was the entrees. The salmon while cooked perfectly, was under seasoned. The rib eye was much too rare (they offered to take it back) and way over seasoned.</body>

        <body>Service was great and the crumb cake muffins for everyone were a nice touch. The mimosas were lovely and the coffee was served with steamed milk - overall the attention to detail was outstanding! Duck confit hash was out of this world!</body>

        <body>Went here for a birthday celebration dinner. I could have gone anywhere and should have gone with my gut and headed into Boston.  They start you off with crusted bread with olive oil and what appeared to be sun dried tomatoes. But NO it was tomato paste that left an awful taste for the rest of the night. Terrible. Ceasar salad had to be returned. It tasted like watered down dressing. Main courses were ok. Dessert was called panna cotta. Clearly this chef does not know the difference between panna cotta and Crème brulee. We do! See YA L&apos;Andana. This was our second and last visit here.</body>

        <body>My Husband and I were seated at a nice quiet table which was somewhat private, as I had requested in my reservation. The lighting and ambiance is just perfect! The wine list is extensive and although we enjoy a good glass of wine, we opted for something else. I had a delicious raspberry martini and my husband chose some type of whiskey drink, that he thoroughly enjoyed. The  dinner was absolutely delicious and included a Filet Mignon and Prime Sirloin with a side of grilled asparagus. Dessert was a tasty molten cake and gelato called Cioccolato! We have been at Landana&apos;s before and have never been disappointed and we will most certainly return again!</body>

        <body>My wife and I enjoyed Sunday brunch this past Sunday and everything was perfect. A couple of the waitstaff that had seen us in many times before came to our table to say hello and our servers were always there when we needed them. The menu was fantastic and presented in an artistic way with accompaniments that were an unexpected surprise. This was our first time there for Brunch but it wouldn&apos;t be our last.</body>

        <body>L&apos;Andana is one of the best restaurants North of Boston.  Food, Service and Management is outstanding.

        <body>A group of us -- friends for 30-plus years -- dine out at least every 6-8 weeks and always try new restaurants (and return to treasured few). This was the first time we met outside Boston. I live in Melrose and have wanted to try L&apos;Andana. There was some grumbling about the location just off I-95 in Burlington and right next to a Mercedes dealership but once we were seated we were impressed by the atmosphere and the acoustics made table talk possible without raising our voices even though it was a busy Thursday night. Service was impeccable: accommodating, attentive, and eager to please. Cocktail menu was interesting. Good wine list. For starters, we ordered crispy calamari and a meat and cheese platter that was varied, tasty, and plentiful. I had the bone-in rib eye with salted potatoes and grilled romaine &amp; gorgonzola (I&apos;m a country girl with a hearty appetite and a penchant for red meat since I never fix it at home). It was simply one of the best steaks I have had in a long while a</body>

        <body>L&apos;Andana continues to provide a nice upscale dining offering in the suburbs. On this night we tried the mushroom soup and the rigatoni bolognese as appetizers. The mushroom soup was very thin and not all that tasty, but I would definitely recommend the rigatoni. For the main course I had the sirloin streak and my wife had the salmon and both were excellent. For desert, we had the apple crostata and the chocolate cremeux, both very tasty. The relaxed pace and excellent service made for a very enjoyable dining experience.</body>

        <body>We came here for Valentine&apos;s Day.  Their steaks are excellent, though overpriced.  Be warned, there are no substitutions to their menu. Their service is excellent, if a bit slow at times. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because they don&apos;t want to rush you, but that makes it hard to find them!  There is a 3 course prix fixe menu available on the weekends and certain times during the week. Be prepared to spend $175-200 per couple with alcohol.  This restaurant is for special occasions or when someone else is paying.</body>

        <body>Set up of the floor plan makes you feel that you have your own space even though others are close by. Our server was simply outstanding.  Could not have beenmore helpful or considerate of all of our requestes - never felt rushed and very attentive when we wanted service.  Seating was also comfortable.  Food was good particularly the Arugala Salad.   Martinis were perfect! Kudos to the bartender too!</body>

        <body>Went Saturday night, enjoyed the Octopus and Mussels app. Loved my Branzino over Shrimp and Bean Ragout, my husband enjoyed his pasta with oxtail. Had cream puffs with lemon curd and limoncello cream and my husband had the molten chocolate cake. Service was very good and it was not noisy.</body>

        <body>We visited on a Sunday evening of Dine Boston and when we arrived, there was already a good crowd.   Wondered if we would feel rushed because they needed our table.  Not true at all.  We had time between the delicious courses and everyone from the host, to waiter to staff was pleasant and efficient.  So glad to see a restaurant doing well after this long Winter!</body>

        <body>This is our favorite restaurant for celebrating. Our latest was my husbands big promotion.  The food is always fantastic.  I like the main dining area better than the overflow area  for groups and that is where we were seated.  But as always it was great food and service.</body>

        <body>The overall dinner was pretty good, better than a few places in Boston. However, I can&apos;t get over the sticker shock when the bill arrived. If the cost was even a 30% lower, I would have been quiet happy.   That said, their brunch is fantastic and a great value!</body>

        <body>We enjoyed a family brunch that included a 3 year old and 5 adults of varying ages.  There were a wide variety of choices on the menu (this is not a buffet style brunch).  Every dish from the cinnamon roll  to the omelet, eggs benedict, fritatas, French toast and pancakes was delicious and the servings were generous!  The pace was slow enough to throughly enjoy the food, yet moved along so that our grandchild didn&apos;t get restless.  We are already planning a return visit as we enjoyed the brunch experience so much!</body>

        <body>Consistently excellent food with each course and exceptionally attentive but not smothering service.  It&apos;s rare to find the offerings to be as good as all the dishes we tried here, among starters, main courses and dessert, and across fish, fowl and meat.  Special praise for the octopus and swordfish, and the deliciously crisp dessert doughnuts with creme Anglais.  For those sensitive to saltiness, as we are: We had tried L&apos;Andana some years ago but not returned because, like Sorellina, owned by the same group, we found the food much over salted.  This time, we asked for no extra salt and the dishes were perfectly seasoned.  We intend to return soon.</body>

        <body>A friend suggested this restaurant. I had no idea we would be pulling up to a castle. This place was gorgeous inside and out. Wonderful ambiance and the food was incredible.  We ordered the Tuna tartar and mussels for apps-- I would give my right hand for those mussels. Absolutely to die for. Can&apos;t say enough about them. The tuna-- could have lived without. Was ok, but glad we opted for a second instead of just the tuna. Size certainly good for one person, could be for two depending on how hungry you are. Waiter said one is fine if you&apos;re definitely getting dessert; we got two apps, and dessert, lol. Well worth every penny.  My boyfriend got the porterhouse. His favorite cut. He loved it. I don&apos;t eat meat so I can&apos;t give an opinion, but he said it melted in his mouth. I got the swordfish. Fabulous, delicious. Wonderful. We split 2 sides: broccoli rabe and the asparagus. These are hefty sides which could certainly be split between two, even three, ppl. We took home all leftovers and ha</body>

        <body>Still good but not as good as previous experiences. Portions seemed larger - too large for my taste. My colleagues had the same reaction. The waiter recommended a $125 bottle of wine; I &quot;settled&quot;for about $85.00 and it was decidedly average. I&apos;ll be back and hoping then to see the restaurant at its best - it wasn&apos;t on my most recent visit.</body>

        <body>As always, we had another great night at L&apos;Andana.  Eddie was great and very responsive to my friend&apos;s desire to keep her tea hot.  The highlights of our meal was the mushroom soup, steak, grilled Brussels sprouts, chocolate mousse (rich and amazing!) and pecan tart.  Compliments to the valet as well - who got our cars to the front faster than I have ever experience in my frequent visits to this restaurant.  We love this place and will continue to visit often.</body>

        <body>Do not order the pulpo. Our waiter said that the &quot;older&quot; pulpo was very chewy, not very good he said. I was excited to try the &quot;newer&quot; pulpo. It was like each bit e was a piece of chewing gum. The main course, bolognese was fantastic. My wife had the salmon, delicious. Excellent desert. Good cappuccino. Way over priced but most places that serve the pretentious folks  of Boston-burbia are.</body>

        <body>Amazing, as usual!  I had my usual, the 8oz filet, and it was cooked perfectly.  My only &quot;complaint&quot; was that my stomach wasn&apos;t large enough to finish it all!  Not because the portions are too large, but because the accompanying side I got, the parmesan roasted brussels sprouts, were so delicious, I ate far too many!  Every last bit of our dinner was spot on, from the bread, to the waitress and her kindness and sense of humor, to the dessert, which would have had us licking the plate clean, had it been socially acceptable to do so in public, lol.  We moved far away from L&apos;andana, about 45 mins drive, but we will continue to make the trek for special occasions because it hits the mark every single time, making the trip worth it!</body>

        <body>With 260+ reviews and an average rating of 4 stars, this review is certainly in the minority and I&apos;m sure it will be dismissed by many. I know if I saw lots of great reviews and came across at bad one, I&apos;d negate it too. Still, here goes...  My daughter and I were seated at one of only two tables in the entire restaurant without any lighting. Also, our table was in a little alcove, and with my back to the rest of the restaurant, I could only see my daughter and a wall. I felt very disconnected. As for the food and service? A big fat MEH!  Here&apos;s a list of all the hiccups:  1. They did not have lemonade.  2. The bread wasn&apos;t great. It was some garlic hybrid. 3. Grilled octopus was very tough and had a bitter tangy sauce that overwhelmed it. 4. The waitress brought us more bread and it was nearly burnt. Super crispy and dry. 5. We waited way too long for the main course. 6. Waitress never asked if we wanted another drink. 7. Waitress wasn&apos;t very attentive. Not rude and didn&apos;t go MIA, bu</body>

        <body>L&apos;andana is one of our most favorite restaurants.  As with any special occasion restaurant, it comes with a price tag.  We always make sure to take advantage during restaurant week - as the food is just as delicious and the service is just as attentive as every other time during the year.  My only issue is that the menu is not always what is shown on the Restaurant Week advertisement (since they go w/availability/freshness/etc - all good reasons to change it )- and I was so hoping for the cod (I had it last time and it was truly outstanding!).  I was able to get the salmon without mushrooms though, and it was delicious.  We look forward to dining with you again.</body>

<author>OpenTable.com</author>
        <body>The NY Times editorial says &quot;La Fondue is the place to go in the South Bay&quot;! Consistently named the &quot;Best Restaurant&quot;, &quot;Best Special Occasion&quot; and &quot;Best Romantic Restaurant&quot; in San Jose by the likes of The San Jose Mercury News,The Metro, The Silicon Valley Concierge Association, and The Wave Magazine. La Fondue brings quality service together with an eclectic chill vibe that caters to the &quot;communal experience&quot; we all crave. Nestled in the Saratoga foothills, Mitchell &amp; Tracey Cutler founded La Fondue Restaurant in 1992 as a boutique dining environment. A kind of Alpine wonderland meets Beverly Hills/19th century Paris lounge kind of vibe. Colors of crushed crimson, gold and royal purples blend with champagne oak and European antiques. La Fondue specializes in international fondues. Come, celebrate a memorable evening!</body>

        <body>We have come many times for special occasions as it is a little pricey. When ordering the full four course meal we were told on our first visit to pace ourselves as everything is so good you want to eat it all. We also recommend an earlier seating as it is a great deal of food to go to bed on after a late seating and you&apos;ll have a hard time sleeping after that much to eat - we did just that our first time here.</body>

        <body>I&apos;m not sure it will be on the top of list for our next fondue dinner.  The décor changed a few years ago when they moved down the street.  I am not a fan of silver/gold plated guns (e.g., the lamp at reception is a gold plated ak-47 (or so our host proudly told us)).  With terrorism and far too many shootings on local streets, the décor certainly doesn&apos;t spark romance -- more like 1950s cold war or an old Bond film.  I like guns in general but I don&apos;t see the theme in this space.  Our waitress was lovely &amp; service was perfect.  The food was good but not great across the board.  The lobster was great (very fresh), the steak was uninspired, the salads were good (but not their usual excellent --dressings were off a bit), the chocolate was great but the rice crispy treats were quite stale.  $200 later it would be nice to see the quality stepped up a bit.  I think  you can ignore the ambiance or request the seating in a different section of the space.</body>

        <body>We went here for our 20th anniversary with a groupon deal. I had no idea how good the deal was. The meal had everything they have to offer including a free bottle of wine. The food was amazing! The wine was just ok, but hey, it was free. We tried everything like alligator, antelope, boar, buffalo, lobster. I really liked the antelope, which surprised me. I would highly recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve enjoyed many special meals here, but always with an even number of people.  This time we were a party of three. It turns out they can extend the dinner combos to three people, with a prorated price.  But be sure to remind them when it comes time for dessert that they&apos;re making it for three.  Fights over the chocolate fondue aren&apos;t pretty!</body>

        <body>My meals was not worth $350 at all. Salad is OK Cheese Fondue is tasty Grilling was the only method of cooking allowed for my meal cooking different meats, It was  tasteless, greasy and I do not recommend it. My clothes and my hair was smelling the burned oil in the pan and my face got the evaporated grease on it too. The broth method is better with more flavor but we were not allowed that choice since they said it will take a long time to cook the meats. Quality of meats is OK and you get tiny pieces same with the vegetables. Chocolate Fondue is tasty but you have to eat it quickly before the chocolate burn. Wine selection: the wine is triple the price from the wine price somewhere else.   All together the experience is once in a long while if you ever decided to go back when you cook for yourself and serve yourself paying expensive price for your meal. Very expensive for this experience and I rather do Fondue at my own home adding my own herbs and flavoring spices with the right amo</body>

        <body>Went here for our anniversary.  First time to visit and we were not disappointed.  Our server, Todd, was outstanding.  Walk us through the menu, gave suggestions and we enjoy every bit of it.  Great pairing of the wine, to the mix lot of foods we enjoyed.  Will definitely be back again.</body>

        <body>I ordered a virgin margarita because I&apos;m 7 months pregnant and wanted to have a little something special with my husband with our special Valentines dinner.  When the bill came, they charged us FULL price for the drink even though there was no alcohol in it. $8 for margarita mix? I could buy a whole bottle of mix at the store for less. Can&apos;t believe they would charge a pregnant woman full price for a non-alcoholic drink. They didn&apos;t inform us when we ordered it and the manager was not accommodating once we pointed this out.</body>

        <body>While the food is good, the main attractions are the intimate atmosphere, the cook your own food experience, and the chance to try a few of the more exotic menu items. A group of three, we felt a little cramped at a table more suited for a couple. The chocolate fondue desert is what will bring us back.</body>

        <body>We have been long time customers of La Fondue.  (More than 20 years).  We look forward to coming to this restaurant for most of our special occasions.  We have recommended it to friends and family over the years.  We came in on Sunday for a pre-valentine dinner due to I am leaving the country with my 3 kids on a vacation and will not be in town to celebrate.  As usual the food was outstanding.  However, we had the absolute worst service I have ever encountered.  Our server made us feel like it was an inconvenience every time we asked for something (additional sauces, items, wine, etc..)  He was super late bringing the requested items then just slammed them down on the table.  In one case the sauce slid all the way across the table.  He never offered me wine so I had to flag him down.  He barely spoke to us the entire evening.  He also never followed up to find out if we wanted any after dinner drinks.  I never realized how much of a difference great service makes.  As I said previousl</body>

        <body>So delicious! Definitely a lot of food, salads are HUGE (the cheese on the chef is a bit over the top considering you are eating cheese fondue…). Honestly, you could be full just having the cheese, salad and chocolate, though it is fun with the meat course. Easily can be a 3 hour experience. Make reservations awhile in advance!</body>

        <body>Me and my wife came her for a date night and we really love this concept. Cheese fondue is so good. It&apos;s exciting to try new cuts of meat. Finished of with a chocolate fondue to die for. Great place.</body>

        <body>The best part for me was the salad, that&apos;s a pricey salad! It was way too dark in there, in fact a woman at the table across from us kept blinding us with her flashlight on her phone which she was using to see her food! Alligator meat was awful, food overall was bland.</body>

        <body>We have been here several times and normally have had a great experience, but this time was not so good.  I think we must have been seated in the kids section!! We were a table of 2 couples, surrounded by families with 2+ kids.  It was so loud and not the kind of experience I expect for the price of this restaurant.  I am not a kid hater, I have 3 of my own, but I don&apos;t expect it at La Fondue.    It was also a little awkward having 2 couples, but they only brought one plate of meat so I was putting food on the grill for the couple we went with.  It would have made more sense to have 2 plates of meat so people didn&apos;t have to keep reaching across the table.    I will make sure to ask to not be seated in the kids section next time (the room with the big red poodle), and maybe our next time there will be better.</body>

        <body>My daughter and her friends had an amazing experience that they will always remember. The staff made it extra special for her with a champagne toast for the girls (ginger ale) since she was born on New Years.  Thank you for making her special day even more special. We love la fondue!</body>

        <body>My daughter and I came to La Fondue during our visit to Saratoga, California.  What a lovely and memorable dining experience it was!  We ordered the four-cheese fondue as our entree along with one of the milk chocolate fondue selections for dessert.  These two items along with our salads provided us with more than enough to eat.  The meal was delicious, the ambiance was very peaceful, and the service was superb.   I recommend La Fondue very highly and hope to return here for another wonderful dining experience very soon.  Thank you .</body>

        <body>Romantic and an overall fun experience! I went with my boyfriend for our one year recently, and the food was fantastic and so was our waitress. If you get the full meal (salad cheese meat and chocolate) then you are there for about two hours. The two hours never gets boring however because you are always occupied by whatever new course they put on the table! Very fun and worth the price. Perfect for special occasions.</body>

        <body>First time at any fondue place. Found the experience very interesting and enjoyable. We came on a Friday and had our reservations two weeks in advance, but they could not honor my groupon that I purchased because that is valid only Sun-Thurs. in any case they gave us the full value of our groupon toward our meal which was great.   There are several flavored of cheese fondue, we chose the stinking rose which is very garlicky! But very good. Next time we will skip the combo meal, as we did not care for their salads and didn&apos;t know we had to cook our own food for the main course. I think just the cheese or chocolate fondue is good enough.   Let me say the ambiance here was amazing!! Very low lit so very romantic. Staff was excellent on service!</body>

        <body>It was well worth the month and a half reservation. For it not being so-called kid friendly, my 3 year old had a great time and ate more than usual. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. We truly enjoyed the environment and great food. I plan on going again and would highly recommend this place to others.</body>

        <body>I would&apos;ve enjoyed the dinner more if it hadn&apos;t taken so long for everything (it took almost 3 1/2 hours for the whole process). And it really needs better lighting in there in order to see how the food looks: I had to use my iphone flashlight to see if the meat was finished cooking in the pan. And the waiters didn&apos;t stop by often enough. We had to wait quite a while for the first drinks to arrive, and then again later for anyone stop by and get our order for a bottle of wine. But the main thing I would suggest to the restaurant is to pre-heat the various pans, plates, liquids, etc, back in the kitchen, so that everything didn&apos;t take so long out front. Also, a better ventilation system would be nice. But I probably won&apos;t be back.</body>

        <body>We were celebrating our anniversary, the romance was definitely apparent!  We enjoyed our time, it was different, but enjoyable.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and thoughtful!  Need to go with a group as it is a lot of food.  The price was high for our liking, but we know why and it is worth it for a celebration.</body>

        <body>Everything was great except for the LACK OF VENTILATION, we came out wearing the food in our clothes and hair, like if we have been on a camp fire or a cheap greasy restaurant, which is not acceptable for a place like La Fondue. So I would recommend this to friends with a warning.  Also, the staff talks so fast when describing the items, it&apos;s hard to follow what they&apos;re saying.</body>

        <body>my daughter took six friends and came here for her 18th birthday. What great fun, good servic and wonderful food.  It was a new experience for most of the girls. The place was a bit dark to see what they were eating and they used their phones like flash lights which mayhave bothered people at the next table. Otherwise it was fresh fun and memorable..</body>

        <body>The overall experience is great. The food is really good and quite interesting consider the meat was not typically what I would normally eat (alligator, kangaroo, elk). The cheese fondue and chocolate fondue was a fun experience.  The service is excellent. My server is very knowledgable about cheese, meat, and is very friendly. The price is also extremely high. Our meal for 2 without my groupon is $400+. This is definitely not your everyday &quot;grab dinner&quot; kind of thing.</body>

        <body>This was an amazing dinning experience! We boxed up the salad as recommended, the Cajun cheese fondue was delicious and so much fun having the waiter cook it right in front of us while we chatted! Then the main course came and we spent 2+ hours cooking and tasting ad enjoying the fantastic meats! T was so much fun! And of course the chocolate fondue was so scrumptious!! It&apos;s pricy but it was so fun and filling!</body>

        <body>Extremely disappointed.   This evening I stopped in with some friends just for dessert thinking it&apos;d be a good time, I was wrong.  The service was a joke. So apparently they only serve the dessert portion 30 min before closing time. Alright fine not a problem we&apos;ll splurge and do the cheese and chocolate route.   Our server was nice but wasn&apos;t all there. She kept saying &apos;I&apos;m new&apos; and sparking up random conversations with no point. We order the ½ cheese pot for a starter and we made sure it was the ½ portion because our main mission was dessert. T  The server comes back 3 min later &apos;Ohhhhhh when I put in your order I placed a full instead of ½ - I hope that will be okay.&apos; I was a little frustrated at that point but said alright just to appease her.   We ordered wine and as a bonus we got to pour our own glasses when we needed a replenishment. That&apos;s a bonus.  After our decent evening our check came didn&apos;t bother checking the total and just threw our cards down. We signed the slips and </body>

        <body>As always, La Fondue never fails to delight. We came with a Groupon, and added a second meal package, and the portions were generous. The waiter was extremely courteous and knowledgeable. We did not feel rushed, and the courses were prompt with no time spent wondering where the food was. I highly recommend the Antelope, and the Alligator. They have an excellent selection of exotic game to choose from, and are willing to make customizations to the cheese and the chocolate fondue if desired. They are attentive to allergies among the party as well, and will leave out or separate foods that might cause issue within the dining party.</body>

        <body>Awesome place for dessert! The combo meals seem to be the most worth it. I think $50 for cheese fondue is a little overboard on its own.</body>

        <body>Excellent choices of Fondue with a grilling option.  We had the works! A solid two hours of eating at a relaxed pace with excellent service.  I am a &quot;Chocoholic&quot; and was in heaven with the Chocolate Fondue options.  Dinner was a birthday event for my niece and she was quite happy.</body>

        <body>Every year we go to La Fondu for our anniversary and they never disappoint!  The food is always delish, ambiance always romantic, and the servers always pleasant with great energy.  The one thing that was a tad annoying though was the other tables who decided to take dozens of photos of their food with their flash on.  Because the setting is romantic, the lighting is dim so flash photography can actually be rather painful to your eyes (just something to keep in mind all you foodies who LOVE to take a ton of photos of everything at a restaurant).   See you again next year la fondu!</body>

        <body>La Fondue has never let me down. I go about once every couple of years, usually for a birthday, and the food and service have always been impeccable. You know what you&apos;re going to get - delicious, fresh, quality food, and the staff is professional, friendly and knowledgeable. My daughter recently dined there with three friends for her 18th birthday. The waiter suggested the four of them share a meal for 2 and add on an extra dessert. He was spot on as they would never have eaten all the food if they had ordered 2 meals, enough food for four persons. I appreciate that there was no upsell nor taking advantage of young diners.  A side note - on a prior visit, we left my daughter&apos;s Cannon Eos camera there but didn&apos;t realize it until 2 months later. When I remembered La Fondue was the last time she had it, I called the restaurant and it was still in their lost and found! My family loves the restaurant and their integrity.</body>

        <body>Our server Esther is great! She provided us with wonderful service on our special occasion, our wedding anniversary, and even  recommended that we take our salads home as the menu we selected, &quot;Le Freak C&apos;est Chic,&quot; was a lot of food for two people. It was a great idea on her part for suggesting it, so we really appreciated it. Please send her our thanks for being an amazing server.  We were so full after eating our delicious entrées and dessert. This place is one of my favorite to go places. I love it!</body>

        <body>Maybe our expectations were too high, but we were very disappointed in our La Fondue experience.  First of all, the service was horrible.  Our waiter obviously did not want to be there.  This type of restaurant requires a waiter that is personable and responsive and ours wasn&apos;t.  It took three different waiters to get our drinks.  The food is good, but for the price there isn&apos;t enough.  And I&apos;m not a big eater!  And, I&apos;m sorry, but, really, a $300 meal for 4 and you can&apos;t refill sodas?  Seems pretty cheap.  I have to say, too, as nice as the ambiance is, if you have any kind of eyesight issues then you&apos;re not going to be able to see if your food is cooked since you do cook your own.  We all had to use the lights on our phones to be able to see what we were doing!    And let&apos;s talk about the women&apos;s bathroom which stunk like raw sewage.  It was horrible.    I don&apos;t think it is unreasonable to expect more from a high-end restaurant like this.  Maybe for a long romantic evening, if the l</body>

        <body>This was a quick and easy choice to take my fiance to but the best dinner ever for her. The service was excellent and our food was just absabsolutey mouth watering. We went with a cheese and chocolate option for the evening. The little mini cheese cake bites dipped in chocolate was the absolute best. Little pricey but worth it. Definitely come back with a group. I will definitely be back</body>

        <body>The restaurant was very nice with an exceptional view.  The service was good and the waiter very accommodating.  The food left a lot to be desired.  The enchiladas looked and tasted like they had been made way ahead of time.  The relleno tasted like it had been fried in stale grease.  Not happy with the food and will not rush back.</body>

        <body>For the second consecutive year we have had a Christmas meal at Las Brisas (first time dinner, second time lunch) to get together with a small group of family members. Both times we were extremely pleased with the food and service. Whenever we go to Laguna we always make sure we have dinner and drinks at Las Brisas, so we are no stranger to this great restaurant. You won&apos;t find a better combination of a friendlier place, beautiful view, or better food and service anywhere in the Laguna area. Las Brisas is one of the reasons Laguna Beach is such an incredible place to visit (and retire to someday!).</body>

        <body>It&apos;s been many years since I&apos;ve been to Las Brisas since I now live on the East Coast.  I always remembered the fantastic location and view, but not so much the food.  We had a party of four and sat inside due to the wait for an outdoor table, but no worries as the views from the inside dining room were also stunning.  We were all very pleased with our lunch entrees and the margaritas.  I have to say,  Las Brisas has upped their ante on the quality of their food!!  On the service side, our waiter was fun and had a great demeanor, but for the number of folks in the dining room (including a large birthday party) we were surprised that only two servers were handling the area.  Not a problem for us as we weren&apos;t in a hurry.  Overall, thumbs up!!</body>

        <body>I made a reservation for Valentine&apos;s Day Brunch at Las Brisas (which also happened to be my birthday) but was very disappointed in the overall experience. We were seated promptly which was nice...hoping this would be how the brunch went. First, their brunch set-up is marginal at best, from the food to the lay-out of the food displays. For what we paid per person, I would give the food a 3-4 out of 10 at best! There was a decent omelette-waffle bar, but all other &quot;stations&quot; were quite the same as you would find at any Quality Inn where they have prepared breakfasts. If it were just marginal food that might be ok at best, but...they ran out of plates so the line became very long, they ran out of salt and pepper shakers so our waiter put salt and pepper from the kitchen in two small metal cups (really?!) and, to top it off, they ran out of juice glasses and asked if they could reuse the ones we had (which didn&apos;t work either because they ended up putting grapefruit juice in the glass that</body>

        <body>We had been to Las Brisas many times in the past but returned again after a gap of several years. I&apos;m happy to say the food and service were very good. The restaurant itself and furnishings are now quite dated and could use some updating but you absolutely cannot beat the view here. We were given a corner round table and it was a gorgeous sunny day. Stick with the salads and the sangria if you want a nice light lunch with a spectacular view of the ocean.</body>

        <body>Aside fro all the pluses of this longtime cliffside restaurant with its killer sweeping ocean view, the wait staff bends over backwards to personalize your food choice, if needed.  Because of this, is was  a lunch of perfection!</body>

        <body>if you love a beautiful environment but need good food as well this is your place! They have a weekday brunch that can&apos;t be beat. The service is excellent and consistent... Every time no matter what.I had a slight problem with one of my dishes and it was taken care of immediately.Arrived before my guest, who  was running late, and they allowed me to sit. Everything I wanted or needed-- I got. it was my friends first time here and he was thoroughly impressed. This has become one of my favorite places and I will drive happily one hour each way, to enjoy Las Brisas anytime!</body>

        <body>Yes, Las Brisas is expensive. Their guacamole is $13, as are their so-so margaritas. However, the view is so stunning, the ambiance so relaxing and beachy, that you end up paying more for the setting than for the actual food. If you are alright with that, than Las Brisas is alright with you! I ordered the salmon and savored every bite. The other people eating with me ordered various seafood dishes and each delighted in the flavors. All around a perfect evening celebrating a special occasion.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Las Brisas before but this visit was extremely disappointing.  We arrived early for a 1 p.m. reservation and requested a table with a view.  We were seated an hour later at a very cramped table.  Service was spotty at best.  The food is good, but terribly overpriced.  Most of the folks in our group had the seafood salad, which they said was good, but it should be for $24.  My dish of a stuffed pasilla pepper and two enchiladas was $18!  The pepper was good, but the enchiladas were dry, dry, dry.  I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll be back.</body>

        <body>Las Brisas has a fabulous setting, capable, attentive staff, a menu with something for everyone, and a good drink and wine list that includes craft beer and regional wines. The fresh fish selection is recommended.</body>

        <body>Was there on Christmas, food was cold. Service was horrible... Host told us we would only be waiting 15 minutes even though we had reservations. We waited for 45 minutes, we started seeing a bunch of empty tables and still we hadn&apos;t been seated. We walked up to the hostess, there were 3 young ladies just standing around talking personal talk. Then one of the ladies was upset cause we interrupted her conversation and said she was just going to call us. I will never go there again. And would of went to Maestros if it was open..</body>

        <body>The food was good, not great. The best part of this Restraunt was the ocean views. I didn&apos;t like the fact that I had to pay for parking. It was valet. I guess you can park on the street and pay meter parking.  Waitress was okay.  I guess if you go for dinner it might be better.</body>

        <body>We were vacationing in Newport Beach and we were told that Las Brisas was a &quot;don&apos;t miss&quot; for dinner. We went for dinner at sunset and the view of Laguna Beach from our table was spectacular! The service was first rate and the food lived up to its prior billing!! We loved it so much that we returned 2 days later for breakfast. The buffet was wonderful and it was nice to eat with a spectacular view of Laguna Beach. After breakfast we walked down the walkway right onto the beach to enjoy the sun and surf. Highly recommended restaurant!!</body>

        <body>Slow slow service fri 4/3.  took 20++ minutes for drink selection or contact with service to ask for water, then another 20+ to get just the water (came after first drinks out). latecomer never got water after a kind request. child got apple juice and not the requested pineapple juice. other tables nearby got drinks/food way before we did and were gone way before we were.(We came in just before the rush). Probably a random fluke</body>

        <body>We had Saturday brunch with the family and  had a great time. Our server, Ernesto, was very attentive and he catered to all our needs. The food was great for the price, there&apos;s quite a good selection for both meat eaters and vegetarians. The view of the ocean was fantastic and very relaxing. I would come back here again and maybe try their Sunday brunch next time.</body>

        <body>The Orange County Register proclaimed it so way back when.  We&apos;ve been going there ever since and still think it&apos;s #1.   Attentive staff, incredible view, great food.  What more is there?</body>

        <body>As always Las Brisas was worth the 2 hour drive from the valley.  The food is always delicious and drinks hit the spot. We had a table over looking the beach. It was a wonderful start to our day at beautiful Laguna Beach.</body>

        <body>We were seated almost an hour past our reservation time.  At one point we were asked if we wanted to wait 10 more minutes for a table w/a view -- 30 minutes later were we seated - so 10 minutes of the hour was our choice.  The hostesses made cracks and fun of customers while manning the hostess stand/greeting desk -- including our party - the waiter was kind enough and tried but slow slow slow meal service and substandard food.   The manager listened to the issues but by then it was just too late.  I was so disappointed -- don&apos;t waste your time or money!</body>

        <body>food was good, view is amazing. Staff at the front was rude. Had a reservation and when we asked to sit outside (arriving 45 min prior to reservation) the ladies at the front acted as if they were being put out. The website says to arrive early if you want to sit outside so I don&apos;t see what the problem was. Everything else I would say was great.</body>

        <body>We had guests from Switzerland and wanted to take them to a special place for dinner.  We went last Thursday evening so the restaurant was not busy.  The view and surrounding area is always  spectacular in Laguna.    Unfortunately the food was not.   We started with the special potato &amp; bacon soup and caesar salads....yummy.    Our main dishes were very disappointing.    I had the sea bass which was overcooked, dry and hard.   The garlic mashed potatoes were barely warm.   My husband had the catch of the day, maui-mahi and he said his was also overcooked and hard and dry.   One of our guests had the filet and asked for medium, it came medium well and barely pink inside.   Her husband had the seafood with angel hair pasta and he was the only one pleased with his meal.      The dinner was expensive for the meal we got in return.   If we were raving about the food, I&apos;d say it was well worth it.     Not a good value for the price!</body>

        <body>Went with a group of 7 including clients. Based on our size, it was difficult to find a table on the outside patio (it was a beautiful day and our clients wanted to enjoy the CA weather as they were visiting from the snowy NorthEast). We had a reservation but it wasn&apos;t valid for outdoor dining. We ended up finding seating in a  shared circular group table - but, several of us ended up in the direct sun and the format wasn&apos;t particularly conducive to chatting. Service was extremely slow (again, it was a gorgeous day and the Friday before President&apos;s weekend). We waited over 20 minutes to get our appetizers, and another 20 minutes minimum for our entrees. The food was extremely good and the waitress attentive - the kitchen appeared to be overwhelmed, though!</body>

        <body>excellent view customers enjoyed it the only negative, we were asked to move from our outdoor seating  for some locals. They were not sitting there at the time, yet  we were asked to relocate. Later, I saw later the staff asked another group to move as well. I didn&apos;t not appreciate that.   Other than that the view was amazing my guests enjoy.ed dinner and our waitress was wonderful.  Highly recommend the place for anyone from out of town to see the beautiful SoCal coast</body>

        <body>Once again it was great!!! I&apos;ve been to las brisas over 15 times and I still love the food, the service, and views. I&apos;ll keep coming back as long as I can.  I live in Utah now and I still come just for las brisas. The first time I was there I did not have kids. This last weekend that I was there my oldest is going to be 17. That&apos;s how long I&apos;ve been coming. Best place in California. No exaggeration!!</body>

        <body>Great views and decent outdoor patio.  The restaurant is very tired and in need of a refresh.  Underwhelming for its location and setting.  Likely relies on the views and standing of the past.  Could be so much more.  Still, not bad.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been going to Las Brisas for years and always considered it my favorite restaurant for lunch. Now , however it&apos;s priced itself out of reach for what it is. They also had a  much more limited menu which excluded entree salads, a choice several of our group had planned to order. Tack on seven dollars for parking and it&apos;s over for us!</body>

        <body>You can never go wrong with Las Brisas.  We have never been disappointed with every aspect of dining - View - Service - Food - you name it.  TWO THUMBS WAY UP - we always recommend it to our friends - especially IF THEY WANT TO IMPRESS OUT OF TOWN GUESTS!!</body>

        <body>Came here Christmas day and although the restaurant was busy, I didn&apos;t get that intimate feeling of a restaurant, maybe because it is quite big so it feels more hectic.  definitely not somewhere for a romantic meal for two. I would say this place would be best for lunch or drinks outside.  As it was Christmas day, I ordered the Turkey and it was a little disappointing.  The Turkey was great but the rest was a bit dull and not that tasty.  Good place for people watching!</body>

        <body>Very accommodating waitstaff, as I was surprised by limited vegan options on brunch menu. Thought I had booked a lunch, and didnt know it wasn&apos;t an option Sundays. Only alternative was dinner outside with a two hour wait! Luckily server suggestion for entree with chef tweaks proved tasty, and all was delicious. Parking even with valet and a reservation required several blocks of circling, to be turned away repeatedly at the full lot in heavy traffic. So parking is the biggest issue besides vegan choices. Otherwise sublime view and pro server with great attitude. We had a wonderful time with out of state visitors.</body>

        <body>We followed up on a recommendation and booked our dinner at Las Brisas and enjoyed a great evening!  Our server was attentive and knowledgeable - bringing a real sense of integrity to our experience.  The Ahi Tower appetizer was unbelievable as was the guacamole.  The sea bass was perfectly prepared.  Each dish was presented with artistic flare - and delicious!  Incredible view of the coast - wonderful experience!!</body>

        <body>The scenery is beautiful! It is definitely a place for a romantic date! The service was great, very friendly staff as well as helpful with recommendations! The food is delicious,  this place is a little pricey but worth it for having such beautiful view! The accessibility to the beach is amazing too! Just steps away!</body>

        <body>Excellent food, especially chef&apos;s selections. This fish dishes are prepared very well. The quantity is just right. We went on a Saturday afternoon after 2pm and the place was packed. The servers had great attitude but the service was extremely slow. It took forever to get drinks and appetizer.  Other than excellent food the views are amazing.</body>

        <body>Food wasn&apos;t what I expected or drove an hour for especially to be Mexican. No chips and salsa on the table stale bread wilted salad and overly priced food. Just didn&apos;t make sense to me for upscale Mexican really wanted authentic Mexican food.will never go back not even for the view or the ambiance. Prefer any other type of Mexican restaurant where you get authentic taste and a lot of food for your money.just didn&apos;t get it. But they definitely got a lot of my money  though so hates off to them for that won&apos;t be a next time</body>

        <body>I took my wife and my youngest daughter and her family for Christmas brunch to Las Brisas.  Wonderful experience.  Spectacular setting with beautiful view of Laguna Beach.  Excellent, courteous, attentive service.  Everyone loved their food.  The seabass I had was delicious.  This was our second annual and we plan to make it a tradition.</body>

        <body>Our table was ready when we arrived.  The food was great.  The service was good and the waiter was very friendly. We were a party of four sitting on the higher tier over looking the ocean and the bay. Just gorgeous. Unfortunately we were not able to have a normal dinner conversation because the noise level was way too high. Maybe the owner of the restaurant can put some noise absorbing materials in his dining room.</body>

        <body>As a celebration for my girlfriend&apos;s birthday, we took her and her husband to Las Brisas last Saturday as they had never been.  Despite a 6:30 reservation, we were handed a pager and had a 45 minute wait. Upon being seated the waiter told us he needed to take our order immediately as they were &quot;running behind&quot; in the kitchen - the feeling of being rushed was not appreciated, despite how personable he was.  After those hiccups and a bar that was woefully understaffed for a busy Saturday evening, we were able to enjoy a number of fabulous dishes.    The calamari was some of the best any of us has ever had - crispy and flavorful tubes and tentacles, served with a lemon butter dipping sauce, that was delicious but not even needed.  We also enjoyed the scallop and shrimp char which was delightful.  Moving on to dinner, two of us enjoyed the Frutas del Mar plate, which was served with a variety of seafood - lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, crab claws and fish - in a light saffron and tomato </body>

        <body>The ambience is beyond. We were seated right away and had a beautiful ocean view. The guacamole and chips were super tasty. My butterflied steak and cheese enchilada were great as was my husband&apos;s sea bass. My Dad&apos;s steak was raw and tasteless. He wouldn&apos;t send it back. It&apos;s pricey there but what a setting. Also, the espresso machine was broken so Dad was not happy. Service was great and we had a charming attentive waiter. My husband and I will return.</body>

        <body>We re from Philadelphia, so the California coast offers beautiful views we don&apos;t see often.  Las Brisas has those in daylight, but even after dark the restaurant offers great food and an attractive dining room.  The wine list is also very good and reasonably priced.</body>

        <body>Excellent food, but along w/ that comes fairly high prices. Obviously, the location of the restaurant influences the charges. We went on a Saturday night and had a table in the &quot;interior&quot;  (no view!) so at that point we could have been in any restaurant! Still a nice place to spend the dinner hour, especially if there&apos;s a special occasion!</body>

        <body>Took our 30 year old daughter there for lunch.  Ricardo, the waiter, was great.  The view was awesome.    The food was very good but the place is definitely overpriced for the food you get.  This place is a once in a &quot;special occasion&quot; restaurant.</body>

        <body>We stopped in for the prix fixe Champagne Sunday brunch.   Wow!  It was a fantastic experience from start to finish.  The food, service, atmosphere and view were first rate.  We were seated at a table overlooking the ocean with a truly spectacular view.  The waiter (Hector) arrived immediately with a bottle of champagne and kept our glasses full throughout our brunch.   Our fruit course arrived on the heels of the champagne -- very fresh and lovely.  Hector made terrific suggestions for our second and third courses.   He recommended the Rancheros - eggs paired with a NY Strip steak and the Sand-Dab topped with avocado and crab.  We were delighted with the preparation of both.  The service was perfect throughout the meal, and the meal was paced well.  We were never hurried through a course and we were never left waiting for anything.    I recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the area.  It is simply wonderful.</body>

        <body>The view is outstanding!  The food is great, nice ambience but the service was ridiculously bad.  If you like being ignored (and it wasn&apos;t just our table) then by all means go here.  $130 for a meal for two, I expect to at least get a glass of water if I request one.  Food was dumped on our table, no one came by to see if we were okay.  We noticed tables around us with menus in front of them for a good 30 minutes, no waiter came by.  Unbelievable.</body>

        <body>Wonderful restaurant with scenic views and great food. The service was quick and efficient, the drinks were good, the ceviche was generally ok, but the Frutas de mar was absolutely wonderful.  We went there with friends and had a terrific night in a beautiful place just off of a great beach.</body>

        <body>I was really looking forward to the Easter brunch offered by Las Brisas but I was disappointed. The price of $45 per person included endless champagne but it was not really worth it. The food was adequate but not special. They were so busy that you had to almost yell to get the attention of the server. I wouldn&apos;t come again.</body>

        <body>This restaurant offers very good food and service with an outstanding location.  The views of the beach and bird rocks are reason enough to visit this restaurant.  We went on Christmas day, which was obviously very busy for this popular restaurant, but the staff did a great job despite that.  I would go to this restaurant again the next time I find myself in Laguna Beach.</body>

        <body>Paid $20.00 for nachos! Ordered enchiladas, nachos, a sprite, kids meal and two drinks and paid $150. This is a tourist trap with excellent view... Nothing more. Locals know this is too pricey for very average food. Lived in OC my entire life and know there are many better places.</body>

        <body>I bring my out of town guests and work colleagues often and our past two visits have been miserable experience.  Our food came out 45 minutes after we placed the order and was cold.  The manager insisted that the food had just come off the line.   Not so.  I will not be returning to Las Brisas and cancelling my future reservation with them for Easter Sunday.</body>

        <body>Been coming to Las Brisas for many many years. Many cherished memories for our family,  Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed.  Seated at one of dad&apos;s favorite tables, (yes, he had numbers written down.  He could remember table numbers at several different restaurants before he could remember his own cell phone number) was a good start. Our waiter was very pleasant in his greeting to us, and I sensed we would be well taken care of.  Not so, as it turned out.  The restaurant was not crowded, but very slow service.  Waited way too long for our meals.  Kitchen issue or waiter issue?  Guacamole was good, chiles and onions on the side, as requested.  Cream of mushroom soup  peppery.   My mother&apos;s entree was the problem.  Sea Bass She informed the waiter she cold not eat ground pepper or anything spicy.  He assured her that it was  delicious, and could be made mild with spices on the side.  Good thing because my sister ordered the same dish, and it was covered with very spicy sauces.  </body>

        <body>recently met a friend for lunch on a clear, sunny day.  We were seated next to the window...what a view!   The service was excellent and we both enjoyed our meals.  Afterwards, we enjoyed a walk along the bluffs.</body>

        <body>For one of the most AMAZING beach views &amp; Sunday Brunch this place is for you. Customer service is off the charts!  A BIG shoutout of gratitude to Ricardo for not only filling our bottomless champagne glasses but for having the patience of a saint &amp; taking priceless BFF pix!!! Our brunch began with a colorful fruit plate followed by warm Mexican pasteries. Highly recommend the filet &amp; eggs entrée but ALL specials were PHENOMENAL!!! Muchas gracias Las Brisas for a muy bonita dia :)</body>

        <body>Took my granddaughter and her husband for Easter Sunday Branch and it was delightful. I had been to eat many times before in the 90&apos;s when I consulted for a local IT company. I would bring my clients here to impress with both the ocean view, the grounds and the restaurant itself. I would could back again and I would never hesitate to recommend the place.</body>

        <body>The appetizers were great. The main courses were served, too early, while we were still eating our appetizers. The main dishes were over cooked and cold. We were not encouraged to relax and enjoy our meal.   Living locally, we have dined here on numerous occasions, We were , again, disappointed with the main courses.   We will come back for appetizers ,only , in the future.</body>

        <body>I have been going to Las Brisas for over 20 yrs and sadly I&apos;ve decided you simply don&apos;t go there for the food or service. My seafood enchilada was like rubber and bland and our server was moody and put off by any questions rushing us. My bloody mary drink was boring and just okay .The view is their gift from God and Mother Nature and that&apos;s about it.  I will be across the street at Urth Cafe for the food and then I will walk over for the view.</body>

        <body>With one of the best locations / views we were hoping to spend a lovely evening of dinner, sunset and warm conversation.  The atmosphere is not at all what we expected - more like an el torrito with a ridiculously loud band in the bar that made it impossible to speak to anyone or hear anything.  We ended up leaving without eating because the staff was not able to provide us with a table far enough away from the incredibly loud bar.</body>

Two round cut piece Chickens of one dollar coin size, One piece Striped Bass with half size of one dollar bill, Prawns Cassolette with about five shrimps are too small portion. Felt had a snack not lunch. Had to eat again in other restaurant right away. Pink grapefruit in Buttermilk Panna Cotta is from a deli can. Set all the people who come for restaurant week in the same corner not in main room and don&apos;t provide regular menu. No people in that corner is white.</body>

        <body>I had eaten at Le Cirque several time before and thought the food and service was impeccable. My experience during restaurant week was not up to par. When seated at the table we were only given the restaurant week menu. The food was good, the service lacked. The table was not cleaned in between courses. The bill was brought to the table with out asking for it or if we wanted coffee, which we did. We were not given the proper utensils for the meal. The fish knife was what we were expected to eat our desserts with. We had to ask for spoons and forks. Although the food was good the lack of professionalism in service diminished the over all experience.</body>

        <body>I took a friend to Le Cirque for her Birthday Brunch. The staff was delightful and very helpful They assisted us in order, selecting wine and overall pleasantness. They also added a candle to her dessert to make this her special day.  I did appreciate the attention and courteous treatment.</body>

        <body>We celebrated our anniversary at Le Cirque this week and it happened to be restaurant week!  We enjoyed all of the food, particularly the lobster in mashed potatoes and the sea bass.  I loved the plates with the monkeys.  The building is beautiful, and we enjoyed looking at the old photos with former presidents, Pope John Paul II, etc.  Our server was a tad on the pretentious side, but still friendly.  I feared we would leave hungry with restaurant week portions, but between the bread and the dessert we still left stuffed.  The only thing that underwhelmed was the appetizer pasta covered in sliced truffles...it was underwhelming for a  $15 upcharge.  That&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve ever been underwhelmed by truffles...strange to say the least.  Anyway, this famed restaurant did not disappoint and I&apos;m glad to have experienced it firsthand.</body>

        <body>We came with a group of friends to explore the glory and fame that Le Cirque has held for so long. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, with incredible attention to decor and the layout. Service was very attentive and excellent. Overall however, the food options on the restaurant week menu did not match with the typical dishes offered at Le Cirque. Similarly, the overall food quality was pretty sub-par, with food coming out too fast to have been made fresh. It was disappointing, but perhaps understandable since it was during Restaurant Week - I&apos;m sure their regular dining options were at a higher caliber, but would not recommend for RW.</body>

        <body>I would highly recommend Le Cirque for couple&apos;s night out dinner spot. It&apos;s scenery is romantic, staff very attentive and food is amazing! I really loved their seasonal risotto. And you must have their creme brûlée. Most loved dishes by me!</body>

        <body>Having been to Le Cirque in Las Vegas and being totally blown away by it, we decided to try the one in New York.  I must admit the room itself is nice and the ambiance was very welcoming although it was a little too hot.  The food, in my opinion was mixed.  We had the foie gras and for me, I didn&apos;t like it all, it was hard and lumpy, not smooth at all and there was a lot of gristle in mine.  I know it is made with fat, but this was like hard rocks of it.  Very unpleasant.  I had pork for main which was well cooked with a nice sauce, but pretty forgettable.  The best part was dessert, chocolate fondant, which I really enjoyed.  But again, was disappointed it wasn&apos;t warmed, so the inside was perfectly runny, but cold.  Would have been much nicer if it was warm.   Overall I wasn&apos;t impressed with the food and everything was so quick we were in and out in about an hour I think.  And when you&apos;re dropping $200-$300 on dinner, I generally like to savour and enjoy it more than I did.  We won&apos;t</body>

        <body>We dined here for restaurant week. While the food was excellent the portion was so small it was barely suitable for an appetizer and we are not big eaters. We have been here before for restaurant week and we were always happy. Not this time.</body>

        <body>A friend and I dined at Le Cirque last week for lunch. The restaurant itself is beautiful - spacious, quiet despite filling up for lunch, and has plenty of waiters ready to refill water as soon as you&apos;ve taken a sip. Unfortunately, the service was disappointing. I have a pretty serious food allergy to carrot, and despite asking the waiter whether my dish selection was appropriate, my dish arrived carrot laden. When I asked for my dish to be made- sans carrots-- the waiter informed me that all dishes are pre-made and the only carrot-free dish was a piece of fried flounder.   Given the cost of a Le Cirque meal, I would hope that dishes could be customized for diners experience. Furthermore, I&apos;m astounded that Le Cirque doesn&apos;t take food allergies more seriously. Carrots are pretty easy to spot, but there are plenty of people allergic to ingredients, like peanuts or shellfish, that can be cooked into sauces and become over invisible to the naked eye.   The bohemian sidecar drink and the </body>

        <body>My husband works in the neighborhood, so when I saw some advertisements for the &apos;Mad Men&quot; lunch specials this week,  I made a reservation for  lunch ($19.95 for two lunches or two cocktails).  Well.....the usual Prix Fixe menu was also offered as we sat down, and  we could not pass up on the additional choices on that menu.  We put aside the &apos;Mad Men&apos; special menu and happily ordered off the usual lunch menu.  I ordered the Lobster Salad for the first course - it was delicious, fresh and flavorful - with grapefruit and avocado (great combination) - I highly recommend it.  For my main lunch course, I ordered the chicken arbois (new word for me - and also delicious !).  My husband enjoyed the Fried Calamari, and mini Cheeseburgers, which he also loved!  Overall, the service was a little slow, but if he didn&apos;t need to get back to the office for a meeting, we probably would not have minded the leisurely lunch, and instead would have enjoyed lingering in the beautiful dining room.

        <body>Lunch at Le Cirque is truly a delightful experience - the dining room is elegant, whimsical, and for power brokers too. Wait staff is attentive and professional, food is very good - although I wouldn&apos;t suggest the snails as an appetizer as they had too much garlic and were salty, however, my friend&apos;s cabbage soup was extraordinary - a shade of violet rarely seen in a soup or food in general. The haddock was good, served with an excellent bernaise, and the vegetables were sauted to perfection. The ile flottante was a variation on a theme - a little soupy but crestive and good - not the classical version that I remember from childhood and in Paris.   As to the dining room, seating is hierarchical - if you&apos;re new to Le Cirque don&apos;t expect to be seated next to the power brokers - unless you are a power broker whose reservation is probably made by assistants in the know.  But after all it was Mad Men lunch week and there were two characters seated next to us. When I glanced at their dishes</body>

        <body>Very uncomfortable about the service. Waiter didn&apos;t seat us based in first come first serve rule, instead seated 4, 5 guests arrived after us. We were seated in the area dedicated based on races. It&apos;s the first time encounter this kind of &quot;arrangement&quot;. Very bad experience. Won&apos;t come back even though food is fine.</body>

        <body>I made a reservation for 7, two of which cancelled and one arrived late. We waited a little for seating but the staff was friendly and accommodating. Friends and I went for restaurant week and had a great time. The wait staff was attentive and I appreciated the patience they had despite the madness I am sure restaurant week brings. My only conditional four star for service-a one point a waiter took a plate from a friend who was stilling working on her meal. Again, I understand the hecticness of the week brings a need for quick turnovers so it didn&apos;t quite spoil the mood. I have to say the redeeming quality was Carmine. The man who was in charge of our table. He was a delight to talk to and meet. Thanks again for the evening!</body>

        <body>i wouldn&apos;t recommend the fish crudo appetizer or the bread pudding. One was soggy the other way too firm. Maybe &apos;Restaurant Week&apos; wasn&apos;t the best time to go.  The service wasn&apos;t very good.  I will say the pork medallions and chicken  main dish was delicious although quite small and I am a light eater (two 3/4&quot; thick by 2&quot; medallions).</body>

        <body>I&apos;m an ex New Yorker and often travel back to the city. My travel companions and I enjoy dining at some of the city&apos;s best restaurants and hidden gems. This is the worst restaurant I&apos;ve been to in New York, or anywhere quite frankly. Their chef has obviously given up and regards the whole operation as a joke. Each dish that we received - an appetizer, main dish and dessert for each of the three in our group - was seriously flawed in some way. For example, the lobster tail that one of my dining companions ordered was literally frozen. The quality of the food was subpar not just compared to expectations, which were high. The food was no better than could be prepared at a mid to low level restaurant in the city. I was absolutely floored at the lack of effort which went into the creation of our dishes.  The one highlight was our sommelier who thoughtfully recommended a nice bottle of wine for us.  Do not go here.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve never dined at Le Cirque before - maybe the kitchen was having am off day?  The service was great, everyone so attentive despite a packed house at lunch.  The food though was so disappointing.  The escargot was  drowning in a garlic sauce that over powered the dish, the chicken with puff pastry featured generous chunks of dry chicken, the spinach side was stingy and heavily oily, the mushroom side was super salty, and my companion&apos;s brisket was bland and a bit tough.  The floating island dessert was good though, the sauce was delicious.  Having never dined at Le Cirque I was disappointed.  Perhaps their moment is over.</body>

        <body>Have been to all three L Cirque locations and have to see this one is the least visually appealing. Food was brilliant, though and that really is what matters most.</body>

        <body>I went to Le Cirque for Restaurant Week with a couple of my girlfriends and it was absolutely beautiful! I wasn&apos;t totally blown away by the food, but it was good. We all were surprisingly full after as well, which was a nice surprise.  I would recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or date night, as it was very romantic!</body>

        <body>Went there with my wife and another friend couple. First, it took me 15 minutes to check in my coat. Then it took 30 minutes to get a drink at the bar. When we went to our table, we found out that a jacket is required. Ok shame on us for not checking before. And we are friends who usually like to dress up (just not that day). But a jacket for this spot??? Turned out that the service followed. Water spilled when being served. Waiters came 3 times asking the same question. Sides never came. And food not good. Avoid!</body>

I went with 4 ppl I think that was just the right number, I wouldn&apos;t go we th a big group the atmosphere is very intimate.  I would definitely recommend and go back.</body>

        <body>This place is historic &amp; beautiful with not great but really good service. The food is old school with very little seasoning.  They try hard and care in the FOH but are lost in the kitchen. No passion in the food at all. Whome ever is cooking is robotic, a true lack of creativity  and care. Hire me and I&apos;d be proud to cook with that service. Sorry guys but I&apos;d love you more if you loved your food. Won&apos;t come back to eat but I&apos;d come back to cook.</body>

        <body>Elegant with fantastic service.  The food was outstanding.  I read a couple of negative reviews and thought maybe they were lowering their standards during restaurant week.  In truth I found the exact opposite. Everything matched or exceeded our high expectations of this iconic family restaurant. Each course was perfection.  I loved the striped bass and red snapper crudo. We all started with a dirty martini.....outstanding.  It doesn&apos;t get any better than this.</body>

        <body>Visited here for Restsurant Week! The menu has a good selection of options to choose from. My friends and I chose different apps/ entrees/dessert  1out3 apps was good� 2out3 entrees were just ok and sorry to say all 3 were bearly room temperature� 1 out 3 desserts were good.  The waiter&apos;s suggestion of bread pudding was probably to get rid of it from the kitchen � Overall the Service was fantastic. It&apos;s what made the experience memorable Just a note: order one of the cocktails!! It&apos;s worth it&apos;s weight in $$$</body>

        <body>Le Cirque is... well, Le Cirque. Wonderful as always and I don&apos;t expect anything less. Service was courteous, prompt, efficient. Food was absolutely delicious. Some restaurants get chintzy with Restaurant Week menus, but not Le Cirque -- terrific selection at excellent prices. Healthy lunch crowd atmosphere, but I never felt rushed or neglected. Would definitely recommend (over and over); but note gentlemen must have jackets, and probably not the most kid-friendly place.</body>

        <body>We have been meaning to try Le Cirque for many years and somehow just never made it. We decided to go during restaurant week. Overall assessment is that it&apos;s ok but does not really stand out in the crowd. Had the Foie gras and the snapper crudo, the foie gras was the more enjoyable of the two but it also carried a surcharge, the issue with the snapper was more the flatness of the flavors even if they tried to play with textures. We then moved on to the braised pork and the Striped Bass, the Bass was the better executed of the two and came closest to what I would have expected from Le Cirque, a beautiful looking piece of fish with perfectly seared skin on a bed of leek based sauce. My issue with the pork was the texture was more like a baked pork chop rather than something that had been braised and allowed to become tender, steeped in its own juices, the accompanying carrot was tasty and the sauce a bit like a tobasco tomato blend which just seemed thin and commercial. The setting is l</body>

        <body>Restaurant week offerings for dinner were well below expectations for a restaurant of this reputation. Service was decent. Appetizers - for example the cudo with cauliflower, does little in the ways of unifying the various elements on the plate. Entree choices are small in portion and very average in taste - for example, the sea bass was overcooked, and the lobster simplessime was disappointing especially given a $15 uncharge. Desserts were largely forgettable, except for the creme brûlée.</body>

        <body>In full disclosure I was feeling feverish the evening I dined here. However, the foie gras, pasta, and chicken off the tasting menu were great. The rest had an off-taste. I would be willing to go try again, but the service here made me extremely uncomfortable and probably affected my enjoyment of the food. I very often dine alone in a variety of places, but I am used to having a principal waiter and not being stared at the entire time by staff. This was not being attentive. There seemed to be at least four waiters involved at my table, two of which always came in pairs. When they weren&apos;t at my table, they were snickering in the corner or right near the kitchen entrance. They rarely made direct eye contact, and no one introduced themselves by name. I was ready to exit two minutes after arriving. Everyone mumbled and kept looking down. On all accounts, I would have been happier so many other places...even a food truck.</body>

        <body>Fantastic decor, very quiet place, efficient service  Food was good, but the desert were a little disappointing.    To offer creme flambee, an item that you could find everywhere, I was expecting something fancier.  Going to this outstanding places is to taste something  new and original.  The service was rapid and efficient, very courteous</body>

        <body>Few notches below compared to other top-tier restaurants such as LE Bernardin, Eleven MADISON park or Bouley, etc.   Overall, decent service, but nothing special if you are looking for that special moment.</body>

        <body>Their prix fixe lunch special is great during restaurant week. Otherwise, I think it is too expensive for what you get. Portions are very small. I tried the pastry topped chicken with cream, which was okay. The pastry was so tiny and the chicken was overcooked. The cream was delicious, and I sopped it up with the table bread. I was told by friends that the escargot and beef were really good. The dessert we got was ile flotante, which was really delicious, with berries and perfectly cooked meringue. The bohemian sidecar cocktail was excellent and made me wish I could stay for another round! It was fun to try this classic spot!</body>

        <body>This was the first time I ate here. Went during restaurant week. The environment is lovely. The food was beautifully prepared and served on the most delightful dishes. I never really pay attention to the dishes but with each fabulous course , my friends and I just loved the place settings. For starters, I had their raw fish bass with berry salad. The quality of the sushi was equal to the finest sushi restaurants I have gone to. Very delicate and delicious. I stayed with the fish and my main course was equally well prepared. The creme brûlée was the amazing. We had a late seating and no one rushed us out of the restaurant. I will return and already have suggested this restaurant for future gatherings with friends.</body>

        <body>We were sent to the cafe side although I reserved for the Le Cirque, which I didn&apos;t realized because it is my first time to this restaurant, I didn&apos;t even know it has two separated sides, till I got an on- show email.  I was kind of disappointed because I could not eat the food I expected to eat.</body>

        <body>Got a gift card from co workers to go to Le Cirque as a wedding gift and I thought &quot;that&apos;s soooo nice but isn&apos;t it too fancy for me.&quot; I was wrong. Men must wear sports jackets but I dressed in nice clothes even with my snow boots on and I was treated like royalty. Their precision in placing the menu neatly on the table looked like an art and their staff&apos;s knowledge on every bit of food and drink is stupendable. We started with agnolotti and although there were only 3 raviolis the way the morsels make love to your palate was memorable. Next I had a lobster salad which tasted divine and my husband had the risotto which he slowly savored every spoonful. I had a drink with tequila in it - the smoothest tequila north of Tijuana! I think it was called El Maestro. The color was a pink like you&apos;d see on a fish in the sea. There was prickly pear in the drink and somehow each sip took me away from the snowy streets of Manhattan onto the beaches of an exotic island.  We split two main courses. T</body>

        <body>Food was decent but not stunning - expect enormous plates with a dollop of entree. I went in a group of four for restaurant week and midway through the meal, one of my friends noticed most of the diners seated around us were of the same ethnicity (none of us are white). Don&apos;t want to make any accusations, but we found it odd and hard to ignore once we noticed this -- most Caucasian diners (or groups with at least one Caucasian) were seated in a separate wing. It&apos;s possible that this was based more on Le Cirque&apos;s idea of who was likely to be a regular versus a RW guest, but, you know, that&apos;s why the review is this way.  If you order, get the fish as the pork was overcooked and tough. The basil panna cotta was ... interesting, although my friend loved it.</body>

        <body>I was excited about visit to this French restaurant and I thought it was great opportunity to see it during winter restaurant week in NYC. Unfortunately, my expectations were crushed.  Foir gras was ridiculously bad. Promised prawns came out as regular shrimp. I need to mention that we were served with soup spoons instead of desert spoons to &quot;indulge&quot; in deserts. Personally, I was upset about my visit and wouldn&apos;t recommend to dine out here.</body>

        <body>The flavor, plating of my dishes are not memorable or worth mentioning. I have to agree with other comments about restaurant week guests being seated in this little side corner of the restaurant. So two stars off for that.   Not sure I&apos;ll be going back.</body>

        <body>My wife and I visited Le Cirque for restaurant week lunch. The decor and service were top notch. Food was stellar. For the first course my wife got the Agnolotti - a savory and hearty serving of beefy ravioli like pasta. Portion was small but the big flavor made up for it. I got the Red Snapper Crudo - ultra fresh and tasty. For our main courses my wife had the Braised Pork. Portion was reasonable but the pork was overcooked. It was in a cumin/coriander sauce so keep that in mind if those flavors are not for you. I had the Striped Bass - large portion and perfectly cooked over a bed of creamed leaks. Really the perfect main if you enjoy fish. Dessert featured Le Cirque&apos;s famous creme brulee which never fails to deliver and the chocolate fondant. Both were stellar. Overall a great meal would give it a solid 9/10.</body>

        <body>The service was wonderful. Very attentive. Food was excellent! Very enjoyable.  The only complaint I have is that my friend and I both are non-drinkers. When I ordered the dessert, I did not realize they would pour the alcohol onto the dessert. If they were a bit more attentive, the server should have realized that we were both not drinking with our meal, and should have asked before pouring alcohol onto my dessert. I could not eat it.  Other than that, my dining experience was wonderful!</body>

        <body>Walking to LeCirque was like walking on the beautiful cobble streets in Positano, Italy and once you enter through the revolving doors you are in Nice, France. Immediately you are attended to by of course a beautiful hostess.  Without asking for any table; I was taken to what I thought of as a GREAT TABLE in this beautifully decorated restaurant. Great attention from the server. Wonderful suggestions.  I must say the rack of lamb was the BEST EVER, it was perfectly prepared. PERFECT�➗ The Flounder amazing mild taste, with a very,very light bread crust.   Wine from Italy surpeb. Forget about a diet. Dessert is a must. The surprise was an elegant gold box like a jewelry box of delicious chocolate. What a wonderful gift to take with you to remember this wonderful still royal European type restaurant in fabulous Mid-town just blocks from exclusive Sutton Place. I MUST RETURN, and VERY SOON.</body>

        <body>Terrible service. My companion waited at the bar for 20 minutes for a drink without getting one. Minimal, perfunctory attention was paid to the table. We were presented with our bill without even being asked if we wanted coffee. Very low-class. The food, with the exception of the snapper crudo and the buttermilk panna cotta, was unexceptional. The prawn dish reminded me of a not-so-great mac &apos;n&apos; cheese. Tres ordinaire. An establishment that has traded on its reputation from many years ago. Interestingly, no one working there seems actually happy or content.</body>

        <body>Le Cirque was simply amazing. The food was wonderful, and they did not skimp at all due to the cheaper &quot;restaurant week&quot; menu that we ordered. It was above and beyond what I expected, and the service and atmosphere were very nice as well.   There is no doubt that I would recommend Le Cirque to anyone who wants some of the best food that they will likely ever eat.</body>

        <body>I can only write 2000 characters so see my full review on Yelp...Let me start by saying I have eaten at Le Cirque in the past and tonight there was nothing technically wrong with the food or the preparation of each dish. The cooking is solid. However the Snapper lacked punch...a little acid or salinity would be a start . The Lobster &quot;Simplesse&quot; isn&apos;t worth the extra $15? There was little lobster in the dish and wasn&apos;t well conceived as an entree. The skin on the &quot;Crispy&quot; Striped bass soggy. Portions overall were small compared to many other dining options out there. I can&apos;t believe how bad the service has become. Yes, was restaurant week and yes, we were a family but my grown kids savvy diners. Apparently eating from the Restaurant Week menu puts us into a lower dining class. When we sat, we weren&apos;t offered cocktails. Nor were we asked to order wine with our meal. I figured I&apos;d catch the waiter after we ordered but that never happened because despite waving to him and being acknowledg</body>

        <body>No matter what new restaurant I plan to go to, I go there with zero expectations. Same is the case with my first visit to Le Cirque. All what I would say is that Le Cirque hadn&apos;t disappointed me. The service was good; the food was to die for, and the dessert was indescribably amazing.</body>

        <body>My wife and I at a reservation for Lunch at Le Cirque with open table Gift which was  offered by family member.. I thought I did my homework and printed at home the voucher / gift and presented it at to the Maitre D&apos; who accepted it and took us to our table , a few minutes later he came back and told us  that this voucher was not valid because Le Cirque name was not mentioned , So we asked him what should we do , his reply was you should go to a computer and print the proper voucher , at that time I was extremely embarrassed realizing that I made a mistake , my wife came to my rescue  and called open table who was kind enough to send the proper voucher which we presented to the captain who scanned  it and told us everything was now ok ... I once owned a three star restaurant in New York and I can assure you that I always treated my customers with respect and certainly always made sure to accommodate them the best way I was  taught , as a restaurateur we sell tables , food and an image</body>

        <body>Beautiful restaurant , the scene did  not disappoint.  Went there for restaurant week, the dinner menu and portion was very little and honestly, - cruise quality.  Maybe the regular meal would be better as the restaurant has a legacy and historical reputation.  I think if restaurant choose to participate in restaurant week should consider this a marketing expense and treat patrons with extra value and quality… so they would return.  This is is not a good pick for restaurant week.</body>

        <body>Maybe the chefs are really tired repeating same dishes over and over again for restaurant week diners, the food have some execution errors: the sea bass skin was s bit soggy, pretty sure it&apos;s supposed to be crispier; chocolate cake, I think it meant to be like a molten chocolate cake with the middle a bit runny, but was over cooked inside. Overall, not impressed for the food, but good value for restaurant week, not sure it would worth a visit back for regular price.</body>

        <body>It is always a pleasure to enjoy the gracious and congenial atmosphere, professional and attentive service and phenomenal cuisine and beverages at Le Cirque.   This visit was particularly special in the I had the chance to speak with Sirio at length and remind him of my very first visit to the first Le Cirque many years ago when it was still on 65th Street.  Le Cirque has been and will continue to be one of my five favorite restaurants in NYC.</body>

        <body>My daughter and I make Le Cirque an annual tradition.  After this week&apos;s lunch, we will be making a new tradition.  The Restaurant Week menu looked good but was a disappointment.  The pork dish - the meat was tough.  My daughter ordered the chicken - it was &quot;pink&quot; and undercooked and had to be sent back.</body>

        <body>Used Mad Men lunch to conduct culinary museum tour. Escargot nicely prepared, as was the floating island desert. Flounder with $5 surcharge was overcooked and off-tasting- a breaded fried slab that could have easily been in a McFish sandwich. But the accompanying sauce was excellent - masking the fish problems. So yes, I have been to Le Cirque.</body>

        <body>Dry, inedible chicken  pot pie; flounder that floundered; dead beat, unimaginative escargot. Pity, since this was once a great place to dine.  The most I can say is that we enjoyed people watching and the ambience with a nice bottle of wine. Unfortunately, we left hungry and will not return.</body>

        <body>We had dinner here on Saturday and had a great time. We have a daughter with special needs and the staff were so attentive to her. It made her evening that our waiter brought her into the kitchen so she could design her own dessert. She was so happy. Even without that experience, our meal was delicious and the service was very attentive and friendly.  Service was very attentive and we did not have to wait between courses. The restaurant was busy and had a mixed clientele, from families, date night and older couples.  Worth a visit.</body>

        <body>We went for the MadMen  special lunch.  The appetizer choice was red cabbage soup  or escargots. We should have had the soup. The snails were at the end of their shelf life and the garlic came from a jar!  The service was lackluster at best. Why not take this opportunity to make new converts? The best part of the meal was the hot and fresh Illy coffee - the only thing actually served at the correct temperature.  Le Cirque will not see us again.</body>

        <body>We felt like going to Le Cirque was one of those things that every New Yorker should do once, but one time was enough. Service was lovely. The food is beautifully presented, and much of it is quite nice, but it&apos;s uneven. Spinach was so salty we couldn&apos;&apos;t eat it. The striped bass was oddly strong tasting but not flavorful (and we&apos;re big fans of bold fish flavor). The buttermilk pane cotta had too much gelatin. The rutabaga cream soup was the best part of the meal. There&apos;s far better food to be had all over the city (including in our little corner of Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights.-</body>

We noticed that the chairs at our table were different from everyone else&apos;s, like cafe chairs with added cushions. Food was good, but nothing to write home about. A few of our creme brulees did not have the recipe on the bottom, probably rubbed off from too much wear.</body>

        <body>Le Cirque never disappoints me.  From the moment you enter the restaurant, until the time you leave. You feel pampered, whether it be by the service, the food or the wine.  It is one of the few restaurants in NYC that I frequent several times a year.</body>

        <body>Dined with my family there on Christmas Eve and it made the perfect start to the holiday. Service was top notch and the food matched the service. The wait staff was attentive and courteous. Despite being crowded they made us feel like we were the only people in the restaurant. This is the second year in a row we haved enjoyed our Christmas Eve dinner here and there&apos;s no doubt it will become a holiday tradition. My thanks to everyone at Maggiano&apos;s.</body>

        <body>On Christmas Eve, as a surprise,  I took my wife to Maggiano&apos;s. We had a 8:45 reservation.  Even though we had a reservation we were asked if we could sit in the bar booth area as they said it would be an extensive wait for a table. I agreed as I did not want to spend my evening waiting. Our server Chris, was very nice and greeted us with a smile.  I have no complaints about him. After being seated at 9:00 we took a few minutes to review the menu at about 9:10 we ordered appetizers and our meals. Our appetizers did not come until 9:50, which was Margarita Flatbread and Mozzarella Marinera. At about 10:00 we were told that our entrées,  which was Lasagna, was not going to be ready for a long time.  It was a little upsetting because I was never told in the beginning that Lasagna was not an option for the evening.  I received word and hour later that our order would not be fulfilled. The manager attempted to give us baked Ziti with crushed meatballs as a supplement but it did not taste g</body>

        <body>We like Maggianos just not on a Sunday. We usually go during the week, but decided to try Sunday night at 5:30 with a reservation. It was pretty crowded, lots of big parties. We felt left out of the loop. Everything to really long to get to us. From the drinks, to the appetizer( that took about 30 minutes) to our entrees. We actually had another waiter  clear our table and pack up our take home because our waiter was busy with a big party.  I  felt really left out. Maggianos is our go to place  and we will go again, just not on a week-end.</body>

        <body>We went on 2/13/15 after making reservations on &quot;open table&quot;. It was our first time. They assumed it was for valentine&apos;s day  (it was for vday and my bday) which was great because they had tables for 2 lined up in the quiet banquet area.  The waitress and staff were awesome.  Loved the food and prices were very good compared to other &quot;competitors&quot;. We even drank at the bar and it wasn&apos;t too crowded. It is basically people waiting for their dinner table. Was able to get a seat there easily.  Only complaint is the parking there. It&apos;s like bumper cars in the parking lot and the whole area is full of popular restaurants. Literally the rows have maybe 10 spots on each side, but they do have free valet service.  Would definitely go again for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>It was a Holiday.....service was not as good as usual.  They needed more staff.  Over heard employees talking about staff that called out. We had a group of six and the staff could not keep up with refilling food/beverage.  It would have went smoother if they brought enough food for six on the first servings of each plate.  Bill came to $250 before tip.  Could have went to the Olive Garden and had just as good pasta dishes. They did not bring enough Taramisu dessert and had to ask for more. By the time they brought it we were ready to go.</body>

        <body>I had veal marsala. I have eaten here before. I feel that the quality of the food has gone down. For the price, I would rather eat somewhere else.</body>

        <body>We were a table of 4 and our waiter was wonderful until he quickly got a table of more than 20 and we never saw him again.  The rest of the meal was downhill from there. Food was great but service was terrible.  Not the waiters fault but something should have been done to help this guy.</body>

        <body>The food was great and so was the service just wish our table was so squashed in I had to sit against a pole. Plus the noise level was so loud could barely hear ourselves talk with all the loud groups around us wish they had a separate place for just two or three people away from the loud groups of ten or so other then that it was great</body>

        <body>Great service great food huge portions worth every dollar you pay!!! Your comfortable just a wonderful place to eat. My only complaint is that we were there at the end of the night and the staff started to loose their professionalism by walking around yelling out to each other they had drinks in their hands and the things they were saying were a tad inappropriate. But the food was wonderful</body>

        <body>We always love Maggiano&apos;s but have been hesitant to bring our kids who tend to be extremely picky.  Even they loved their food.  My 10 year old tried the Maggiano&apos;s salad.  Not only did he love it, he asked for more.  He has never asked for salad in his entire life!!!  He tried all 4 of our entree selections and loved them all.  We are so happy to have another restaurant where we can all enjoy our meal and not have to fight with our children or talk into a clown&apos;s head.  Amen!!!</body>

        <body>As always,  very good food, service, and atmosphere.   We have come to depend on Maggiano&apos;s to provide Classic Italian food at any location we visit across America.  However, it is recommended to always have a reservation, I use OpenTable.  Sometimes calling the restaurant does not get the same times available to OpenTable.   It seems everyone loves Maggiano&apos;s since even with the reservation we had to wait 15 minutes.  But, that was no where near the 1-1/2 hours those without reservations had to wait. The wait is worth the reward though, we almost always go for the Classic Pasta, and one to take home, for the price of one. Not inexpensive but worth the cost.</body>

        <body>This was our 3rd Christmas Eve dinner here -- and our last. Our server was very nice but clearly waiting on too many tables. The food? Ugh. Tough beef, frozen mussels, etc. What happened Maggiano&apos;s?</body>

        <body>We got a booth and we&apos;re so squeezed in I could barely get in. Even after moving the table back and forth it was unbelievable. There is a table leg to climb over just getting in. Don&apos;t know why we didn&apos;t ask for a table. It was early and not crowded. Been there several times before but always had a table. That said, the service was good and the food was excellent. Will definitely return but never will I try to sit in a booth.</body>

        <body>I first ate at a Maggiano&apos;s at the Hard Rock Casino in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Saw this at the mall and decided to grab a quick lunch. They serve generous portions for a lunch menu!   Most importantly, ask for Janet as your server. One of the best professionals I&apos;ve ever had at a restaurant. Class act, friendly, attentive, superb knowledge of the menu. She&apos;s an owner&apos;s diamond in the rough for customer service and a diner&apos;s dream come true!</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been satisfied customers of Maggiano&apos;s for year. We arrived early for our 4 PM reservation and sat at the Bar until about 4:20, having a drink with our friends.  No problem with the delay, we ate and talked, staying much longer than we would have normally.  Again, no hassle from our waitress or management.  Absolutely love the place...great food, great service!</body>

        <body>This place plain sucked. The only positive was a great waitress. Used to be one of our favorite places, but the past several times we&apos;ve been there the food has been lousy. The chicken was grainy and tough,  and not cooked all the way. We are not going there anymore.</body>

        <body>Food is good.  Made from scratch and can be changed to your liking.  Waitress killed the meal when she said there is only 1 refill of the ice tea and I already drank both.  Tried to substitute a coke, but she said an additional charge will apply.  Keep in mind, the tea is already $3.75 with 1 refill.  I don&apos;t think I would bankrupt this restaurant for substituting a soft drink in place of a 2nd refill of tea.  Instead that would be an additional $2.50 or so.  We&apos;re  talking $6.25 for water and flavoring here people (tea leaves and high fructose corn syrup).  My girlfriend gave me her drink in front of the waitress so the waitress wouldn&apos;t have the satisfaction of billing me for a refill.  Felt like I was getting my hand smacked &quot;NO TEA!&quot;  Kind of embarassing to say the least.  Been there 2 additional times this month and never was I told about the refill rule.  Needless to say, we had a great time those last 2 visits.  Service was great then with no bickering over drinks.  The waiter </body>

        <body>I took my family to celebrate a birthday and once again, we had a great outing at Maggiano&apos;s.  The food was spot-on, the service dropped just a tad but was still very good.  I can always rely on a great meal and spectacular time at this great establishment.  I particularly like the Chicken Marcella and Fried Mozzarella.  I can&apos;t wait to go back again!!</body>

        <body>had reservations for 6:30 December 24th.  Not super busy, no one waiting in line.   waited 40 minutes for first course.  that was the start...no reason to be in a restaurant for over 3 hours to eat dinner.  I probably would never go again!</body>

        <body>We met friends. All choose different meals and appetizers.  Everything that was ordered came out at good temperature  and was wonderful. Both my husband and I ate dinner  and had enough  left over to have dinner  the following evening. All warmed up very well.</body>

        <body>The service and food was on point. Glad I made the reservation because the 2 hour wait was not going to happen. The last time i came they ran out of apple crestada desert and i told the waitress about it. When she went back.... they said they were out but she got me one somehow thank goodness. They need to make more if they are always running out.</body>

        <body>Our meal here was a disaster.  We waited more than 30 minutes for our appetizers because the server put in an order for 40 people instead of 4.  Our server seemed to be hiding from us and we found it difficult to get answers as to where our food was because we could not find her.  We later learned she was embarrassed by her mistake and was avoiding our table.  Entrees were a little better but we ended up waiting more than 30 minutes again for dessert.  The manager did come over to our table, apologized for the wait and assured us that this would not happen again on our next visit.</body>

        <body>We were greeted warmly by the host when we checked in. We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation time and were able to grab a drink in the bar. Our table was ready for us exactly on time. Our server was attentive, although not overly friendly, and our food was delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>We booked reservations one month in advance for a special anniversary. From what we have seen before this restaurant is on the fancier side. Upon arrival guests were dressed in sweatpants and t shirts. We received a booth like we asked for but it was a very tiny cramped booth. We ordered the Marcos meal for two. You get a meal to take home that you must place your order with your first meal. The appetizer came out fast but the meal did not come out for 50 minutes the waiter kept telling us his manager would personally bring out the food which he did not because he was &quot;too busy&quot; is what we were told. After our meal we ordered desserts to go. We got our desserts and the check but no meal to go, we figured it was cooking. after sitting for 30 minutes we were finally able to find our waiter. He came over and said I was wondering why you guys are still sitting here. I told him we were waiting for the meal to go that we ordered when we first sat down. He said oh I have to go tell them to m</body>

        <body>I discovered Maggiano&apos;s during a work function as must say that I was quite impressed with the service and the great food. I&apos;ve now re-visited with my family and it was perfect.  The service we received was great and was very consistent with my last visit. The true winner here is the family style menu which is a great option for groups of 4+ so you don&apos;t have to settle on just one dish and ALL of the food was phenomena. I&apos;d highly recommend it to anyon.</body>

        <body>Food was good as expected at Maggiano&apos;s, and service was also good.   Being forced to use the valet is not cool, and on top of that having him not be able to move my car and trying to move it with the parking brake on since it is a manual was not a good experience for me.   Next time I need to park with the valet I will go somewhere else.   That ruined the experience overall because he almost broke my car.</body>

        <body>Our server Jessica M. was great. She was knowledgeable on menu items and we did not have to wait in between courses as they were brought out just on time.</body>

        <body>They have switched to frozen meatballs which is a big negative for me.  And when i asked the manager when they switch and they lie to me that it is still home made it made me angry. I can tell the difference as can most people. Last time i eat at maggianos.</body>

        <body>We had reservations for 6:45, but were not seated until almost 7:30. The lobby was full of inconsiderate people that ran or bumped into me or my date numerous times (we were standing still). The hostess was not very empathetic when I asked her at 7:15 when we would be seated. If a restaurant is going to accept reservations, then they should be prepared to seat their guests within 15 minutes of their time. The wait staff were nice and the food was good, but not worth the wait or the noise level of the restaurant.</body>

        <body>Valet parking was backed up for a while I guess it was really busy. The restaurant was packed but our table was ready on time. My wife and I both ate here before but it was a first for our friends. We went to the Bar to get warmed up and ordered the sangria was outstanding, and the beer was cold! Our dinners were out fast and Hot! everything was to perfection (I ate too much!) My wife ordered another Sangria that was not so good, the waiter took care of it right away (Great service). My friend had the apple pie alamode, he said the pie was cold but he ate the whole thing.  Overall the experience was great.</body>

        <body>Normally everything is amazing. I have not dined here in a year. The food was good but was not what I remembered. The service was at best what you would receive at a fast food restaurant.  I was not happy to say the least. I will give it another shot and hopefully I caught them on a bad day!</body>

        <body>I wanted the toddlers to  have the spaghetti but they filled up with the bread wanting for the many choices to arrive. My sister, my brother and the adult nieces and nephews really loved the food.  Chicken parm., giant meatballs and spaghetti,  chicken masala, four cheese  ravioli,  Caesar salad, artichoke spinach dip, and  mozzarella almost stopped us from eating the new York cheese cake and choc. mousse cake. Almost.  The doggie bag was full and so was everyone else.</body>

        <body>I was a bit concerned at first.  It was a Saturday night, the place was jumping like every other restaurant in town. People are packed in there like sardines.  But the noise level was acceptable and service was prompt.  The wine prices are outrageous, I must say that!  A small glass of the &apos;house&apos; red was $10, and there was very little under that.  9 oz. glasses were upwards of $18-20!  Menu was very good, specials looked very interesting.  My young son was not impressed by the kids menu and ordered a calamari/shrimp dish off the specials, intended to be an appetizer.  Older son thought it looked interesting so he ordered that as well.  I thought being an app it would not be enough but it was a very generous portion of lightly breaded seafood, served on a bed of greens and peppers.  I tried it and it was really good.  Many items are offered as a &apos;lighter&apos; version, and as everything is prepared to order, they are able to meet most requests for changes.  I ordered the lighter version of</body>

        <body>I have an issue with the wait time for reserved tables.  Why if you make a reservation would you, even after getting to the restaurant 15 minutes earlier than the reserved time, have to wait an additional 40 minutes. I assumed that the reservation meant they knew you were going to be there, and would have a table ready at least within a 15 minute time frame.</body>

        <body>Parking was horrible including valet. Took 20 mins to get car at the end from valet. Could not relax as i felt they wanted us out of there in order to sit the next reservation. Paid outrageous price for low cost wine. Server was good but clearly could tell hi job was to get us in and out. Not an enjoyable experience.</body>

        <body>Our visit was a nice experience. I went online &amp; made our reservation, so when we got there we only had a short wait till our table was ready. We had a two sitter booth that was comfortable &amp; cozy. The waitress was very nice &amp; informative, she had a lot of knowledge about the different drinks &amp; food. The food is reasonably priced &amp; is very tasty. We have told many people about Maggiano&apos;s. We&apos;ve been coming there for several years &amp; hope to continue doing so. Thank you again for a great dining experience.</body>

        <body>Food was great. But I made a revservation for 5 and still was told I had to wait with a buzzer. Wasn&apos;t happy. Then when I got a table my party of 5 was squeezed into a corner booth for 4. Again not happy. Then when we asked for another table we get a small round table that was right in the way of people walking. I had to open the leaf up for more room to fit the food. Also when they came to serve the food they were so much in a hurry the food was almost just thrown on the table. Not sure I would want to go back with service like that.</body>

They give you more than enough food and it tastes so good. The waiter was very nice also. I recommend it to anyone who loves Italian cuisine.</body>

        <body>Ellie &amp; I always dine at Maggiano&apos;s in Cherrry Hill, NJ after Sunday mass around 12pm.  We were greeted by Allen &amp; Chelsea and served by Desiree. Also, Walter,  Jessica, Emily, Christine, Sebastian, the bar tender Chris and the mgr Chris all stopped to say hello! Amanda has a wonderful staff! Her mgrs.  Lauren, Chris, Michael &amp; Jason have the restaurant running smoothly. Service is excellent and the food - just like Mom&apos;s! Cucina di Mama! Mom&apos;s Kitchen!! We miss seeing Patrick, Katie, Kyle &amp; Bill.  Ellie &amp; I are always very grateful to the wonderful staff at Maggiano&apos;s and the well prepared entrees by the chefs!  The restaurant is beautiful and a true delight to dine in.  At this time we wish everyone a wonderful Easter and we&apos;ll see you all in two weeks!  Ellie &amp; Mario</body>

        <body>Food was excellent and abundant - good value. Restaurant is very noisy - not a &quot;romantic&quot; destination, but fun for lively groups. Server was attentive and friendly, but not overbearing. Food is cooked to order so any dish can be customized - gluten free, dairy free, add/remove different ingredients from any dish, etc.  Portions are large enough that each one in  our party of 4 took leftovers home. Desserts are large enough to share (I wish we had known that before we ordered!) Reservations are a must for a Saturday night, and should be made early in the week to get the time you want. We were seated right at our reservation time - others without reservations had a long wait. Pricing is comparable with other nice restaurants in the Cherry Hill NJ area.</body>

        <body>I, typically, stay away from any sort of &quot;chain&quot;restaurant, but a friend said he&apos;d had good experiences there, so we decided to give Maggio a try.  The pasta was real good, the sauces were flavorful.   Shrimp were crisp and nor overcooked. And the salads were fresh and dressings creative. Best of all was the service which was pleasant and efficient but not intrusive. This is a good, local place to have dinner.</body>

        <body>Meal was good however there was a pricing discrepancy. Menu has special price posted as one price and our bill had it priced $8 more. We were told it was the lunch menu? Not possible since it was attached to the actual menu.  Our server wasn&apos;t near when we noticed the price error and when we questioned another server she said she charged someone the same higher amount. It was 6:30pm no where near lunchtime. That&apos;s deceiving.</body>

        <body>Maggianos used to have great food, on my last   two visits the food has been horrible... I will no longer dine here.... plus $70 for 3 to have lunch that wasnt good at all is a total waste of money.... 1 spaghetti n meatballs (one to go) 12.95, 2 chicken parmesan platters 15.95... 3 sodas tax n tip... NOT WORTH IT AT ALL</body>

        <body>We had a very good dinner at Maggiano&apos;s - Orlando. Our party of four opted not to order the &quot;Family style&quot; dining and we do not have regrets. The &quot;Family style&quot; is a huge amount of food. It would be fine for those who have the ability to store and reheat all of the leftovers from such a feast. It was not a practical option for those staying in a nonsuite type hotel.  As for what we did order, the lasagna, lobster carbonera, veal marsala and chicken francese were all well prepared and delicious.  Our starter salads were well made with fresh ingredients. The special dessert was a great way to end our meal. Service was solid throughout our meal. Overall, we would recommend dining at Maggiano&apos;s.</body>

        <body>When we made our Open Table reservation, in the comment section we wrote one of our party was celebrating a new belt in martial arts - nothing more. At the end of the meal a plate arrived with cookies, cream and candles and around the plate were written (in caramel and fudge) words of congratulations and encouragement. Very nice, completely unexpected. So, A+ on service this time around.</body>

        <body>The ambiance, service and food were impeccable!  Thank you to our server Ian for a memorable experience! You truly exemplify what the art of service should be in the restaurant industry. Though it was not on the menu, a simple request for horseradish was met with the Chef skillfully creating a white truffle horseradish sauce made to accompany our meal. It was truly special and amazingly delicious. Thank you Matt Rando, the Banquet Operations Manager for your kind words of congratulations. Maggiano&apos;s of Little Italy at Point Orlando, we will definitely be going back - &quot;Hungry for More&quot;!</body>

        <body>This is not a place for a quiet romantic dinner. It is very lively and fairly loud place. Your plates will be huge but good! You will definitely have enough for a second meal the next day! The quality of the food is very good? We enjoyed the food. As for service, it was great and our server was very nice and really attentive to our needs.  I would definitely go back!</body>

        <body>Very disappointing experience in Orlando.  We got seated and finally the meal was complete after 2.5 hours.  Very disorganized and staff just didn&apos;t seem to care.  We order family style and we had to beg them to bring more.    From past experiences at other location this one really sticks out very negative.  Everything was a hassle.  For this price range I should not have to be treated this way.  We ran out of water and 20 minutes later after asking it finally showed up.    I would not recommend this location.</body>

        <body>First, I was disappointed to see this Maggiano&apos;s in Orlando had to be asked to &quot;honor&quot; the take one home specials as advertised on the Maggiano&apos;s website.  This was not only offered, but encouraged when we visited the Phoenix restaurant!    Food was very delicious.  Bus person knocked over my friend&apos;s cocktail and his solution was to drop two napkins over the 24-inch pomegranate wet circle and walk away.  Later, I asked the waiter if he knew about it and he did not.  Only upon request was the cocktail (had been nearly full) replaced.  Tablecloth was never changed.  That really altered my friend&apos;s &quot;birthday girl&quot; feeling and my joy of treating her.</body>

        <body>Don&apos;t forget to book as this restaurant is always packed with long waits - 90 minutes on the evening we visited.    It&apos;s reputation is well deserved, with excellent food served fresh and in good sized portions. Staff are always friendly without being pushy.   Always on our &quot;must visit&quot; list when we&apos;re in the area.</body>

        <body>My wife and I had dinner for my birthday last Friday night.  Had a great meal once again.  We requested one of their small booths in the dining room via the open table requests and Maggiano&apos;s came through.  Service was top notch.  My only complaint is that the noise level can get a little high when they are really busy.  They have small deserts that are just the right size.  Maggiano&apos;s portions are generally large so you might want to pick the lighter size when available.</body>

        <body>We love Maggiano&apos;s.  The food, service, and atmosphere are always so good that it is hard to believe that this is a chain restaurant.  Whenever we have out of town visitors, we make sure that a trip to Maggiano&apos;s is on the list of things to do.  In fact, before we moved to Orlando, it was always a must on our frequent visits.  One suggestion:  dinner is usually hectic, noisy, and crowded.  Lunch has the same excellent food without the large crowds.  Convenient location on the I-drive near the convention center, I-4, and Sand Lake Rd.</body>

        <body>Wonderful service and the food was out of this world. This is in a tourist area but doesn&apos;t feel like it all when you get inside. We were a bit early for our reservation but were still seated within seconds of our arrival. I had Chicken Marsala and my wife had Shrimp Fra Diavolo and they were both outstanding. Great experience and can&apos;t wait to go back.</body>

        <body>I have been dining at Maggiano&apos;s since first visiting the one in Chicago in 2000.  The food and the service have always been outstanding.  I wish I were closer to one being on the Treasure Coast of Florida but it makes the trip that much more worth it when we go.  All the dishes were incredibly tasty and there were plenty of leftovers to take home.</body>

        <body>Great dining experience. Reservations a must or there is a 45 minute wait. As always very attentive service, food was superb complimented by a nice pinot noir. Try the soup, it is to die for. Life doesn&apos;t get much better. Don&apos;t forget the complimentary take home pasta meal if/when you order a classic pasta dish.</body>

        <body>The food was good (not great).  The prices are outrageous! The noise level is very loud. The value for your dollar is not there.  The value is in the family style menu,  but you can only order it for parties of 4 or more.  I wanted to order the Family style menu and it was only the two of us.  They said the would have to charge us for 2 adults and 2 children to order on the family style menu. Not a good value.</body>

        <body>Anastasia was great and timely.  Needed a to go order after our meal and she did a good job of making sure the to go order had all it needed.  Bar did a great job of splitting our wine between 2 glasses; didn&apos;t need a bottle that night.  Food delicious as always!  Food exceptional as always at the location</body>

        <body>food was very good except for the chicken parmigiana.  we were however extremely disappointed with our seating arrangements.  we had reservations for party of 6 but only 5 chairs at our table when we arrived.  we had to leave a space at our table for the back of a guest at the next table. servers asked to move our table over twice after we were seated.</body>

        <body>Took some friends to Maggiano&apos;s and had a fabulous dinner. We ordered the family style dinner for the four of us. There was so much delicious food that we couldn&apos;t stop eating even though we were stuffed. We had 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and 2 desserts, unbelievable! The price is extremely reasonable, especially considering the Dining scene near the theme parks. We can&apos;t wait to go back.</body>

        <body>The food &amp; service are top notch - ambiance reminds me of some of the Atlantic City &quot;wise guy&quot; haunts.  I could easily picture seeing Buggsy Malone at the next table.  Prices are very reasonable with huge portions!  Great tomato sauce!!  cold bowl for cold salad - sadly overlooked way too often</body>

        <body>The food was amazing. Huge portions and what you want from an Italian restaurant. The service on the other hand was lacking. Our server would rush to the table and talk really quick and then would say do you have questions and then would be off again before we could ask any. My boyfriend and I were both taken aback because we felt very rushed the whole meal.I understand restaurants are busy,but this was a little much.</body>

        <body>A large room full to tables and booths with red checked table cloths and white napkins. They found our reservation quickly and we were seated shortly thereafter (wait for walk ins was over 1 hour--and the theme parks are at LOW capacity this week.)  it&apos;s a large room, and was full of people dining. The tables are close together and it&apos;s fun to watch the waiters and bus staff maneauver when they are carrying a tall armload of plates.   It&apos;s fairly difficult to hear conversation here, given how large and open the space is. We were seated at a U-shaped table, which made for great people watching, although the people on the ends couldn&apos;t hear anything the other was saying.   The waiter was friendly and attentive. The menu is standard--pasta in many shapes and forms, mostly with red sauce. Huge servings.  Service was prompt, but not rushed.  Food seemed over salted rather than spiced. The sausage served with the gnocci was so salty it was not edible. Pasta with mussells and clams was fresh</body>

        <body>wait time was very very long,this might be isolated to this specific restaurant though since it is located in a very touristy spot.waiter was great and very patient with our high energy 3 year  old who was all over the place.food quality was excellent from appetizers to entrees.only issue again was that we waited so long for food to arrive.I would definitely repeat again,this time maybe in slow tourist season.</body>

        <body>We enjoyed the bruschetta, Caesar salad, cheese ravioli and lobster carbonara so much on our first visit, that we had exactly the same thing on our next visit two weeks later!  Great service! Great food! Portions are huge.</body>

        <body>This is a great place on I-drive to take visitors.  We ended up trying them out after getting rained out at Disney and were very impressed.   This is also a great place for people who want vegetarian/kosher options.  Very accommodation to diet restrictions.  Excellent Happy Hour, and the food is much better than typical chain faire.  The food is great and even the house wine was good.  Make a reservation if you want to go for dinner as they tend to get busy at night.</body>

They even send you a chef to the table if anyone in your party has an allergy, or any eating restrictions.  We will be back next time!</body>

        <body>i have been to Maggiano&apos;s in the past and really enjoyed it. This time both of our dishes were extremely salty. In my fiancée dish they secretly attempted to replace her polenta with potatoes. Our waiter Vic was overworked with too many large parties. He did the best he could and we do understand dining in Orlando is a challenge this time of year.</body>

        <body>Orlando during Christmas New Years week. Really crowded everywhere you go. Here for soccer. Open table and maggianos easy to do, got the reservation and had a great meal. This location has several banquet rooms so planning for a large group would be a snap. The food quality was as expected and you know you will never leave a maggianos hungry. In orlando? Eat at maggianos!</body>

        <body>What a great anniversary dinner at Maggiano&apos;s, which was referred to us by a friend who frequents Orlando.  This place is great...from the environment of the restaurant to the wine list and full menu, what an amazing experience.  Our server, Larry, did an excellent job of catering to us while  maintaining his other tables.   The entire place was packed at 730 when we arrived, make a reservation in advance as there would have been over a 60 minute wait!   opentable.com was a great resource!  I would highly recommend visiting Maggiano&apos;s during your next trip to Orlando, you won&apos;t be disappointed!</body>

        <body>We hadn&apos;t been to Maggiano&apos;s for over 6 months which, to us, is a very long time.  We had reservations at 1:00 p.m. and had asked for a specific booth, as well as a specific server.  Our server was not in that day and we were told when we arrived that there were people already in the booth we had requested and they were just sitting and talking.  They hadn&apos;t even ordered dessert yet.  They had been there since 11:30 which really wasn&apos;t a very long time given that we spend about 2 to 2-1/2 hrs. there every time we go.  Our waiter was Jeff.  Jeff was very personable and caught on quickly that we had been there before; especially when we ordered the family style menu.  The family style menu has changed and they have eliminated a few of our favorites.  Plus the pricing has changed inasmuch as there where a few extra dollars (maximum $9.00) per person on several dishes.  All in all, we would still recommend Maggiano&apos;s to our friends and plan to go back again.</body>

        <body>We came from out of town and were late for our reservation. We came in at 9:20, resos were for 9pm.  We explained to the manager, David, that there was unforeseen traffic coming from the airport and since we were from out of town we had no means of contacting the restaurant, but we still wanted to make it, so instead of ditching these reservations and going elsewhere, we honored our reservations here. The manager we spoke to had no customer service skills and said we had to wait another 45 minutes to an hour and were treated as a walk in.  I told him this kind of service was unacceptable as he did nothing to accomodate us -- a party of only 2.  His apologies were very unsincere.</body>

        <body>Every Maggianos we&apos;ve visited has been great! Orlando&apos;s is no exception. Good food every time and wait staff is nice! Be sure to make a reservation no matter how small your party. 1.5 hr wait for 2 on a Friday night. We learned from our first experience and made a reservation thru opentable for our most recent visit. Very convienent and we were seated on time. Thanks, Maggianos and thanks, opentable!!</body>

        <body>We are frequent patrons of Maggiano&apos;s Pointe Orlando.  While I understand that tonight is a holiday and everything is crowded, for Maggiano&apos;s this is a normal day.    Most of the time when we eat at this restaurant, its packed, inside and out.   Our reservation was for 7:30pm, party of 6.  We were seated right away.   Both our servers introduced themselves, but only 1 of them attended to us the whole evening.   When the 2nd would stop by to ask if everything was okay, we&apos;d ask for simple things like more water, or balsamic vinegar.   We never saw him again.   It was very strange and not the service we&apos;re used to expecting at this restaurant.    The only thing I could surmise is that maybe they were short staffed due to the holiday, because as far as crowds, this is nothing new for this restaurant.    Personally, I don&apos;t think I will go for Christmas Eve again due to the lack of service we received tonight based on any other normal night.</body>

Our waitress  Stephanie, was not only anazing, but had or appetizers,  drinks,  main courses  and deserts , coming before we could even ask. She  and all the staff, from Stephanie &apos;s co-workers , whom assisted her and everyone  who works at this Orlando Maggianos were not only amazing, but performed like a well oiled machine. It was truly incredible to watch and what a great evening  and Birthday  my son and family were given. Kudos to Stephanie,  her co- workers ,Staff and Management,  that made this possible.  My family and I afe from Tampa, FL and visit the Orlando area quite often for short week- end get a ways. We have been to our local Maggianos  in Tampa, but this Maggianos  in Orlando ,is by far the most efficient,  enjoyablle, professional,  customer oriented restaurant,  that I&apos;ve  ever been so taken away, by their service excellent  food and customer care.

        <body>The food is fantastic, although the service has a lot to be desired. We finished our starter and before the plates we cleaned away the main were brought to us. I moved my plate so the server could place my main on the table thinking she would then take it away but no she walked off. Good job there was only two of us and we were seated on a table for four. Plates were piled at the side of us with glasses from the drinks we had drunk.  We had to ask for the plates to be removed. This is about the fifth time we have been and I&apos;m not sure we will go again. Not one person asked if the food or service was good, it was feed them fast and hope they eat quick and leave, and don&apos;t forget your tip for a rubbish service.</body>

        <body>Maggiano&apos;s is always consistently good food.  We have never had a bad meal.  The service generally is very good.  At times the staff seems over extended and attentiveness is lacking; but for the most part good service.  We continue to visit the restaurant 2-3 times a months.</body>

        <body>Our son was in town for Spring Break and we decided to go back to Maggianos where we had his 16th birthday dinner three years earlier. It was fantastic as always. It is a bit loud, but festive. The service was excellent, but not rushed. This is a fun night out for locals too when you have the time to mix with the area visitors.</body>

        <body>Usually enjoy Maggiano&apos;s when we go but this time was awful. TERRIBLE service, long wait even after reservations made and walk in&apos;s went ahead of us. So many issues. May think about if we are going to go back. They likely do not care as they cater to the high tourism in the area as opposed the residents in the area so this bad review will not have too much impact. Sad to say.</body>

        <body>We ask to be moved away from a table that had a number of young yelling children and they had no problem changing our table. Our food came very quickly and was very good, we shared a Creaser Salad which was more than enough with our food. It was very good and fresh. We will for sure return here the next time we visit orlando again. An would  reconmmend this restaurant to everyone.</body>

        <body>I&apos;m doing this on mobile so I apologize in advance for the bad formatting.   My family loves Italian but frankly doesn&apos;t like to stray too far away from the classic dishes like cheese ravioli with Alfredo sauce or a good potato gnocchi pastawith a classic meat marinara. I on the other hand enjoy the unique tastings of Italian with a lot of flair spice and flavor.   Maggiano&apos;s had dishes my entire family could enjoy and that is no easy feat. It was so good we came back two days later just to try some new menu items again.  The atmosphere was a little noisy. It was close enough to the resorts where you had a lot of tourists dressed in t-shirts that took the atmosphere down a notch. My only real complaint.  The prices were extremely reasonable and fits most family budgets. Appetizers were around $10 and most pasta dishes were under $20. I had the Delmonaco steak which was cooked to request and was still in only in the thirties.  as I previously alluded to, they have some really great sau</body>

This was a fail end to end:  1) Waiters were BS&apos;ing with the next table while we sat there.  Table that was seated AFTER us got their order taken first.  Fail. 2) Once order was taken, they never took the menus away.  They remained on the table the entire meal. Fail. 3) Finished appetizer; waiter never inquired if everything was OK. Fail. 4) Meal came after a wait via food runner; again waiter never checked if everything was OK once we started eating, drinks needed refreshing; nuttin&apos;.  Fail. 5) No one ever cleared the entree plates once we were done.  They had no problem getting us the bill...we had to move plates aside to complete the bill.  Fail. 6) No apologies from the waiters for anything.  Fail.  7) Paid the bill...gave them 10% with reluctance and struck Maggianos off our list for a return.

        <body>The lighter fare addition to your menu is much appreciated but, in my opinion, the caloric totals for most of your dishes are way TOO high. As a person who likes to stay fit, I found the choices very limited to the few lighter fare options. I&apos;d like to see that part of the menu expanded.</body>

        <body>We had One chance for us to get together with my daughters&apos; family for the Holiday. This has been a challenging year for her and her husband. And the gathering had to be a very Special one.  My wife and I are familiar with the many qualities of Maggiano&apos;s. Whether it is just the two of us, or a repast with the granddaughters. As well, we have seen the efficiency aand the pleasant attitude of the staff while serving weddings and  corporate banquets  For our Holiday meal, we chose to use the Family Style. We had a Wonderful time, Delicious food, a very accomodating and Friendly waiter.  Here, the term &apos;leftovers&apos; is an injustice. A &apos;second chance&apos; or, to reLive a memory is much more suitable.  We most certinly will continue to dine at Maggiano&apos;s in 2015!</body>

        <body>We have dined here many times over the years. As locals in a tourist town, there are few places we can consistently recommend. This place is one of them. Always a vibrant atmosphere! The food is made from scratch which is amazing considering the size of this place. The staff is spot-on! Half of any great dining experience is the service and this place has never disappointed us.</body>

        <body>The experience at Maggiano&apos;s in Orlando was wonderful.  The ambiance is nice but since it is a tourist destination, expect it to be a bit on the loud side.  I am not a wine person but the wine list was extensive and menu has a lot of options.  The service is very good, the waiters are very knowledgeable.  The food was good but I have had better (and much worse).  All in all I think it a nice dining experience for a very fair price.</body>

        <body>I enjoyed my Christmas Eve there, and had awesome service. She was super sweet and the manager was nice as well. The chef came out to the table and asked if we had any special requests. I told him I was vegan, and he said ok well whatever you want just let them know.. He didn&apos;t suggest anything. I just asked the server to make me a sautéed veggie bowl, I didn&apos;t want pasta, so just throw in every vegetable you have back there. Well, the entree was brought out by another server and it was pasta with spinach and tomatoes. I told the waiter who brought it out what I had asked for and he had an attitude. So my server came back and apologized endless and I told her again just have them sautée every veggie they have in some olive oil and garlic maybe. So it comes out spinach, tomatoes, and barely any asparagus, no garlic... Why no eggplant, broccolini, free beans, mushrooms? I saw many veggies on the menu, just seemed as if the cook didn&apos;t care what so ever. Because if he did he would have b</body>

        <body>I have been to this Maggianos 3 times and I have never been disappointed. This place literally has your entree at your table about 10 minutes after you order. The service also has always been fantastic.</body>

        <body>Me and my girlfriend went to Maggianos to celebrate Valentine&apos;s Day and it was a great decision. From the bruschetta to my Shrimp Diavolo all the food was excellent and i loved that we were able to eat healthier by chooaing the lighter take choices. And our server Dutch was all around Great. It has been a while since i have had attentive service like that. Great spot</body>

        <body>Went to restaurant on a Saturday night. It was very busy and I definitely recommend a reservation, it was easy to make online and we waited maybe five minutes to be seated. It was quite noisy, mainly because of a screaming toddler nearby. With that considered, Saturday night may not be the best time for a romantic dinner. On the other hand, it very family friendly. My friends&apos; lasagna and penne dinners were very good, my mussels were just okay. Service was slow and our waitress was noticeably inattentive, even though other waiters in the area seemed to manage just fine. There was just a general lack of effort to communicate, even though she spent quite a bit of time with the table next to us. Since that experience was tied to one person, I would recommend trying out the restaurant and making your own judgement. Order the lasagna.</body>

        <body>What a wonderful experience our group of 5 had at Maggiano&apos;s.  From the moment we arrived with our reservation in hand we were greeted and seated.  The service was outstanding and our server explained everything on the menu is hand made in their kitchen.  Please prepare yourself for large portions of wonderful food with even health conscious varieties available!!!!  Thank you for such an extraordinary first experience.  We will be back or at least we will find a Maggiano&apos;s close to home.  P.S.  thank you for the Military Discount!</body>

        <body>In comparison with most of the other well known Italian restaurants in Orlando, Maggianos is a way better choice.  A large menu, very friendly (not snooty) service, good wine list, and GREAT prices drive it&apos;s popularity.  The parking is comped, with a big lot next door, which unfortunately does fill and thus can make parking problematic.</body>

This time the service was not up to Maggianos standards and it was very disappointing because I went with my friends for the first time.

        <body>I&apos;ve been to the Maggianos in Atlanta, which was fantastic so I assumed this would be just as good, but I was mistaken. There was 5 of us and 3 of the dishes was not good. Two of us also ordered a side dish of spinach which was so salty we couldn&apos;t eat it. My son&apos;s dish was good which I was happy since it was his birthday. The service was ok but not great. I would not go again to this location.</body>

        <body>First off the resteraunt was extremely busy. Even so, our server was there to greet us and check on us in a timely manner. Not to often but not to scarce, just the perfect amount. He was very generous and polite. For a very busy night our food came extremely fast and the only thing I could say is WOW!! It tasted amazing. They were some of the best crab cakes I had ever eaten. Then to complete the night with the New York style cheesecake, I was in heaven. I plan to visit Maggiano&apos;s many more times in the future.</body>

        <body>We went there in a Wednesday night and didn&apos;t wait much because we had a reservation, don&apos;t go there without one, you will be waiting for a long time. The ambience is a bit crowded, tables are kind of close to each other. Our sever was nice, but not amazing. I had wine, my husband beer (too warm). We ordered a flatbread that was really good and both plates were very good also. For desert we ordered the sample and I think that was a great price for the amount of desert. Overall food is very good, service is average and ambiance is not that comfortable. Price is not the cheapest one ($50 per person tip included), but it is not super expensive, food flavor make it worth.</body>

        <body>Great dining experience.  Food was delicious.  I would have preferred the restaurant lighting be a little dimmer.  Our server, Laura, was spectacular.  She gave just the right amount of attention without continuously bothering us, she was always available without hovering.  Her demeanor was perfect, spoke just enoiugh, gave advice when requested, was so patien and cheerful, just an overall pleasure.  All of us noticed and remarked about how professional and skilled she was at perceiving our desires and needs, knowing when to approach us, being available, she had a quiet refined demeanor, very approachable without botherine us.  She was very patient and polite.  I arrived over an hour before the other two members of my party, went ahead and occupied our reserved table.  Laura showed no sign of annoyance or dismay at how long I occupied the table prior to the others arriving and us ordering.  She never rushed us, she made sure we were at ease and comfortable about taking our time even t</body>

        <body>Great food, great service. The dining room was too noisy-very loud. And the tables were too close together, but overall good for a family dinner.</body>

        <body>We celebrated my wife&apos;s birthday with 5 of is in our party.  We were seated near the kitchen exit - so there was LOTS of energy as people were streaming out of the kitchen!  It was a super busy night, but we were seated within 15 minutes having made a reservation online. Our waiter was great!  He kept us happy with bread, food, drinks and updates along the way.  We had the family style serving - and he paced the apps with the entrees and brought seconds as we went!  He was wonderful!  So even though it was noisy and busy - the food and service was as expected - very good!</body>

        <body>Loyal customers from the beginning when this restaurant originally opened in Chicago, a teeny, tiny place.  Now apparently it has become too big.  Could not get the variety flatbread basket, no shrimp cocktail, no farfalle, once staples on the menu and reasons for patronizing the restaurant.  Our waiter was the saving grace.  HIs name was Donatalle and his assistant Max.  I am sure I spelled his name incorrectly, he was a transplant from Eastern Europe and every so pleasant.</body>

        <body>There is very few restaurants that I enjoy going to in Orlando.. this is one of the few that always has good service and good food. That and the fact that I hate going anywhere on international especially during the winter months when the area is packed with tourists that can not drive they are the only place that I put up with that to go to.</body>

        <body>Christian was our server and he was fantastic. Our table had a special food allergy request which he took care of without issue. My meal was not brought out when everyone else&apos;s was, but Christian took care of it immediately and then the manager came out to check on things. The food was fantastic and service even better. If you are not familiar with the area, I strongly recommend reservations and plan on arriving early enough to drive along International Blvd and park in Pointe Parking Garage. Traffic is usually congested close to the restaurant.</body>

        <body>Everything was most enjoyable at this bistro.  We usually frequent the one in Lincoln Park, but the Oak Brook one is just as pleasant.  The Restaurant Week menu was a good value.  I would say that they downsized the portions of all three courses to make up for the $22 price tag, but each course was adequately sized.  The onion soup is one of the best in town.  The steak frites was served just as I order it. The dessert trio was nice.  All in all, a pleasant experience.</body>

        <body>Mon Ami is an excellent représentation of French Cuisine.  They have a lovely, complete Menu with various options from sandwiches and crepes to main course entrees.   Their Onion soup is superb and quite filling.  Many side dishes to choose from are interesting and tasty.  They make their own sorbets which vary daily and are among the best I&apos;ve ever had. Come prepared for a leisurely and delightful experience, but make a reservation or you might be disappointed.  They are closed from 2:00p.m. to 4:00p.m. during the week, but open for both lunch and dinner.  Brunch is available on week-ends starting at 10:00a.m.</body>

        <body>I have enjoyed going to Mon Ami Gabi in a couple of other occasions, both in Chicago and Oak Brook. That is why for this Valentine Day I made reservations way ahead of time to get a French flavor for our special day. Except for the name and wine, there was nothing French about our dinner. We made the mistake of going for the specials, and probably due to the large number of people they had coming the food was pre prepared and tasted like college cafeteria food. The fish my wife ordered was crusted due to the heaters and you could taste it, and had lost its tenderness. I made the mistake of ordering prime rib, and ended up regretting it. The mashed potatoes were like picked from an all-you-can-eat buffet. Definitely not worth the $195 final tab (for two) Also, only after my Bordeaux was I told that it contained mostly merlot, and little cabernet.  Will probably go back, but definitely not on a special day when the crowds are huge.</body>

        <body>I brought my husband to your restaurant for his surprise birthday dinner which I had noted in the online reservation.  We were greeted with a &quot;happy birthday&quot; to him immediately upon giving our name to the hostess.  The entire staff could not have been more accommodating and attentive and the food was absolutely delicious. We enjoyed a really nice bottle of wine and my husband was given an amazing birthday dessert.  A WONDERFUL evening.  We will definitely return.</body>

        <body>My family and I really enjoyed it. The place was kind enough to seat us early. The waitress was very accommodating and helpful. The hostess and fellow wait staff were also very nice. They checked our coats and always attended to our needs. Aside from the exceptional waitstaff, the food was great. Lots of great options including a kids menu. I would recommend this place to anyone!</body>

        <body>I enjoyed my evening at Mon Ami Gabi very much.  I was there to celebrate my guest&apos;s birthday.  I noted in the reservations as such, and upon arrival, she was wished a happy birthday by the host who seated us.  The entire restaurant was treated to complimentary french onion soup because of how cold it was outside, which was a very pleasant surprise.  We tried two of the cocktails and were quite pleased with them.  Our waitress was very friendly and always asking if she could be of assistance with questions or getting us anything.  The food was fantastic -- I had the wild boar ragu.  We ordered a dessert which was dressed with a candle to celebrate the birthday -- a nice gesture.  Then when I received the bill, I was thrilled to see that the dessert was on the house for the birthday.  IT was a great treat!</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve eaten at Mon Ami Gabi almost two dozen times over the past few years and, as I told my wife last night after a wonderful meal, it&apos;s consistently great and better still it&apos;s consistently interesting. The things you like about it -- the ambience, the wait staff, the menu -- keep the overall quality high without stuffy pretense. But there&apos;s always something a little different, in a good way. We both had the striped bass with a starter of the lobster bisque. Both off the menu as specials, both exceptional. Sancerre to accompany was perfecto. Hey, it&apos;s a French bistro -- and it is executed wonderfully. Simple but elegant.    I&apos;ve been a Lettuce Entertain You fan for a while and have done pretty much the whole list of restaurants from L2O to Tru to Everest. And Shaws and Joe&apos;s and Beatrix. And Reel Club and Antico Posto. And dollar for dollar, point for point, Mon Ami is the MVP of the group. Excellent food and atmosphere, reasonably priced (though the wine list leans toward the over p</body>

        <body>Very impressed with our dining experience at Mon Ami Gabi. On a cold and busy Valentines Day evening, Mon Ami Gabi delivered on everything. Let&apos;s start with this- we had a 7PM reservation and we were seated AT 7PM!!!   Great valet service right at the door, wonderful ambience, helpful and attentive server, great menu and wine selection, quiet enough to have a normal conversation, well prepared food, no feeling of being rushed through dinner and  sincere thanks for coming from the server and hostess. We&apos;ll be back.  So why not 5 stars across the board? They ran out of crème brulee. At a French restaurant. On a Saturday night. On Valentines Day. Almost perfect Mon Ami....... :)</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve dined at Mon Ami Gabi several times and always enjoyed the experience.  We always enjoy the bistro ambiance.  The cocktails were made to order and delicious, the dessert was a shared order of bananas foster and the perfect ending to a pre-Valentine lunch.  The downside was the entrée, the special of the day, a prime rib sandwich.  We were so looking forward to this, however, much to our dismay, it was a baguette with a single layer of very thinly sliced prime rib  It was well seasoned, but hard to find.  This is not typical of the serving size we&apos;ve enjoyed there in the past. However, the service was courteous and prompt and the rest of the experience was certainly up to our expectation of one of our favorite eateries.</body>

        <body>I have eaten at Mon Ami Gabi for lunch with a friend many times.  She particularly likes the French onion soup.  On this particular occasion I was there for a birthday dinner with my husband.  Food was good--fresh ingredients, creatively prepared and presented.  But if you are looking for an authentic French bistro experience, this is not it.  We have enjoyed our experiences in Paris at various bistros and restaurants.  And we have found a few (very few) fairly authentic bistro-type restaurants in the Chicago area. Mon Ami is not one of them, but the food is very good.  I would recommend it for a nice lunch or for dinner.  Atmosphere is very pleasant and the service is always good.  But it is not really a French bistro, in my opinion.</body>

        <body>Good food, but nothing special. Nothing specifically French there. There is a chance that they put you at inconvenient table in the middle of the dining room . A glass of wine there means 1/2 of a regular size at other restaurants. Lamb and dessert was good. Overall ambiance is good if you sit in the right place. Slightly noisy.</body>

        <body>This is our second visit to this restaurant.  The service remains quite attentive.  The menu choices are limited, but the restaurant concept is a French bistro.  The appetizer and entrees were delivered timely and we enjoyed them.  The house malbec was disappointing, I thought it might have been opened too long.</body>

        <body>We arrived with a 5PM reservation and were seated promptly. We were  with friends and were interested in visiting with them. There were empty tables around, so we felt we could move at our pace. The food was excellent. We put off our server to enjoy a few sips of drink before we ordered. Most of our party ordered appetizers. We were eating, sipping and talking. Barely three bites into the apps, the food arrived, served by kitchen staff. We turned it back, remarking on the speed. When the server came by, he was surprised and puzzled we were still on appetizers. We asked for drink refills. When they were served, he wanted to bring the meals. For the sake of quality we agreed, knowing they were just sitting under a heat lamp. The steaks were OK, the fish not so much. Overdone and chewy, cooking under those lamps. We have been here many times and have never felt pressured to eat at the servers pace. Disappointing way to finish off our holiday season.</body>

        <body>We used Mon Ami as a meet point to catch up with an old friend. The Skate Wing was excellent and the sides (Spatsel with Capers and fried Cauliflower) really highlighted the fish. I&apos;m glad they changed the sides from the last time I was there. The scallops were nicely carmalized and delicious. Tuna was perfectly seared and highlighted the salad. all were pleased.</body>

        <body>Three of us adults had a lovely dinner one Saturday night.  I made reservations for my birthday, and we were well received, and received our requested booth seating.  Ambiance and food choices are excellent, and not too pricey.  My only disappointment would be that salads, and soup are all alacarte.  You do however, receive ample bread and butter before your meal.  I just feel a salad included with the entre would be a reasonable request.</body>

        <body>We come here about twice a year because it&apos;s my mother&apos;s favorite restaurant.  But to tell you the truth, I don&apos;t understand why! Service is just as mediocre as their food.  Every time I hope my food will come out hot, and it never does. Nothing on the menu is that great.  I wouldn&apos;t recommend this restaurant to anyone with all the other choices available in the Oak Brook area.</body>

        <body>The food was delicious.  The trout and haricot vert were outstanding and you have to try the mashed cauliflower.  My husband thinks the French Onion Soup is as good as he&apos;s had anywhere.  We were celebrating our anniversary and they very generously comped our drinks which we very much appreciated.</body>

        <body>We go to MonAmi fairly often for the reason that it is a great place.  The food is wonderful. This weekend we had the mussels to start, fabulous! Then our husband both had steaks which they loved and us women had fish. I had the salmon and my friend had the trout. I can never stop praising the wait staff, as they are so attentive and nice, but not in your way. Our waiter was friendly and informative. And we were able to speak to the &quot;wine guy&quot;, and he helped us pick a really nice wine for dinner, and it was not the most expensive wine on the list. We love MonAmi, and would definitely recommend it for anyone.</body>

        <body>Given that our waitress provided a level of service equal to or worse than that of our worst experience in a Paris bistro, I&apos;d say the MAG provided an authentic experience. After taking our orders and struggling to open a bottle of wine,  she disappeared. Our food came, minus two side dishes, and she never came back to check on us. She did return after our dishes had been cleared away, mumbled an apology, and said she&apos;d be right back with a special dessert for my wife&apos;s birthday. (Yes, we were celebrating her birthday, but no one at the table had told the restaurant or the waitress -- so we sat there completely mystified.) Ten minutes later, she returned, set down a small cream puff filled with ice cream in front of my wife, and disappeared again without a word. We sat there watching the ice cream melt in disbelief. After another twenty minutes, I tired and failed to get the attention of the hostess, but finally managed to flag down the waitress -- by this time the melted ice cream wa</body>

        <body>My wife and dined at Mon Ami gabi the day after Valentine&apos;s day.  After being seated and introduced to our waiter we were told that several of the popular items were &quot;not available due to the large crowds on Valentines day&quot;.  But one of those items, the onion soup (one of the reasons we came here) would be ready in about 45 minutes.  It was 6 PM and I wondered what did the staff do all day if not prepare dishes for the evening?   Two minutes later, our waiter announced with fanfare that the onion soup was ready.  It was very good but did lack....onions....  Just lots of broth, cheese and bread. I ordered the Wild Boar Ragu.  The flavor was overly strong with very few pieces of meat but ample mushrooms and celery pieces.  Later, I found out that the pasta that usually accompanies the dish was substituted with a shell pasta that tasted like it had to come from a box.  My wife ordered the Steak Au Poivre which is described as steak with peppercorn and brandy sauce.  She could easily tast</body>

        <body>One thing we value is knowing our experience will be great whether it is Saturday night or Wednesday lunch. The staff is personable , knowledgeable about the food and willing to go the extra mile. The wine list is small, filled with excellent examples of French wines that are good values( just ask for suggestions) The menu offers a  chance to try classic French Bistro done right. There are daily specials and soups as well as Chef&apos;s preparations for the day.  Go and enjoy. Try Monday night  for a special treat.</body>

        <body>Enjoyed a romantic Valentine&apos;s dinner here.  The food was good even though they were out of several items due to the crush of Valentine&apos;s Day patrons.</body>

        <body>I love going to Mon Ami Gabi!  The ambiance is delightful, the service is reliable, no one rushes you, and the food is delicious and consistently good.  It hits the mark every time.  The trout amandine is perfection.</body>

        <body>We dined during dinner on St. Patrick&apos;s Day.  Due to our first 2 white wine choices not being available we thought it might not turn out to be a great dinner.  Our server Brian was the BEST.  He found a wine that was even better than our first two choices but charged us the same amount as our original selection.  He let us take our time and was more than accommodating.   The mussels were fabulous and both entrees (different preps for filet mignon...) were perfect.  Thank you for a perfect birthday celebration!</body>

        <body>From the moment I entered the door of Mon Ami Gabi- Oakbrook I was impressed.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very welcoming with the scent of fresh baked bread in the air.  The staff all worked in harmony to attended to every guest, my water glass was never empty. The food was so good, I was there for lunch so I had a smaller portion but was very pleased with my steak. I definitely plan to return to Mon Ami Gabi for dinner.  It&apos;s a great place to dine.</body>

        <body>Excellent food and ambiance - good service too! Felt like the French version of Maggiano&apos;s with the dark wood, decor and white tablecloths.  We were a party of 4 and everyone enjoyed their selection - Grilled Salmon Salad, Scallops with Butternut Squash and Brussels Sprouts, Lobster Roll with salad and Waffle Bananas Foster.  Some of us tried Escargot for the first time, we all enjoyed the complimentary French bread, and finished by sharing Creme Brulee and Bananas Foster (since the main dish got oohs and aaahs - all delicious!  This wasn&apos;t a cheap meal, but very high quality and worth going to for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>I had the classic steak frits.  The steak was excellent but I prefer their former pomme frits which were like very crisp french fries.  The ones they serve now are more like potato chips.  Brian, our server, was excellent.</body>

        <body>Mid-Week lunch reservation in the run up to the holidays. This location is within a shopping complex. Traffic and parking were an absolute nightmare. Just taking one tour around the parking lot took forever before we elected to use the valet parking option. We arrived 10 minutes late for our reservation......all due to the traffic and parking issues directly outside the restaurant. The Maitre D&apos; was smug and dismissive when he told me that he had given my table away because we were late. When I questioned him why he would give it away 10 minutes after the reservation time, he responded in the same dismissive manner telling me that is what happens when people are late. The food was just ok. The server wouldn&apos;t shut up about how good the crepes were. I had the Chicken &amp; Swiss, which was dry and lacking any flavor. The most flavorful thing on my plate was my side salad. My business college had a the fish crepe, which looked a lot more meaty and came with a sauce which probably made the c</body>

        <body>Very nice well appointed understated French décor. The food was acceptable although nothing to die for. The server could have been a little friendlier. We will come back and have a few cocktails and a snack at the bar. It&apos;s overpriced for he quality of the food but then again the rental must be high there in Oakbrook.</body>

They compted my dessert which was nice, but we still spent $100. for two less than average meals.  I will not go back.</body>

        <body>The staff was great, drinks were good, but the food not so much. We ordered chicken liver mousse as an appetizer and of course received the complimentary bread loaf &amp; butter. My wife had the sea scallops with butternut squash and I ordered the skate wing. We thought everything tasted fine at first, but 10hrs later my wife awoke in the night with classic symptoms of food poisoning. We both ate the same foods for breakfast and lunch so the variable is dinner and the timing reinforces that.  We visited on a busy Saturday night so it wouldn&apos;t surprise me if the cause was food left under a heat lamp too long or cross contamination. Either way just don&apos;t eat here.</body>

        <body>I mentioned that we had theater tickets when I booked through Open Table. We were seated right away, service was attentive but not overbearing and we had plenty of time for dessert and coffee before we had to leave. Made it to our performance in plenty of time. The menu is limited, but everything we ordered was wonderful, as were the cocktails and wine. It was crowded, but we didn&apos;t feel rushed and it wasn&apos;t too noisy. Good for catching up with old friends over a nice meal.</body>

        <body>Enjoyed having lunch with some out-of-the-routine menu options. The ample choices available from the gluten-free menu ensured that our entire group was able to have something delicious. The service was also great.</body>

        <body> The food here is aleays spot on, and really authentic for a chain restaurant.  No matter what we have ever ordered here, it was always prepared perfectly. Recommend going on Mondays when bottles of wine are half off.  Our service is usually great but this time it wasn&apos;t : the waiter never checked back on entree taste and temperature!!   He didn&apos;t know anything about the beer menu and didn&apos;t seem to know much about the menu either.  Did not have any idea how to describe items other than to restate the obvious descriptors printed on the menu.  Did not ever offer to check with his manager to get better answers to our questions.  The food runner Mixed up our appetizers because he didn&apos;t know who had ordered what.  We had an 8pm reservation but had to wait quite a while for a table to come available.  We were not offered anything more than a verbal apology for this inconvenience.  I was a bit disappointed but I would still recommend the restaurant since every time we have been, the servic</body>

        <body>I really like this restaurant during dinner time. I tried it for brunch for the first time and I was a little disappointed. I read the reviews about the blueberry french toast being good so I went for that. They were ok, I thought they will taste more like blueberry, it was just a few berries on top. The bread was dried so I had to ask for extra maple syrup. My friend ordered the vegetable tagine and it was tasteless but spicy. We had to add garlic and other sauce to see if it was better. The service was good and the ambiance was nice. I will continue to go to this place but maybe for dinner I like the menu at night and the wine list is always good.</body>

        <body>Went for brunch during Restaurant Week.  Mon Ami Gabi was offering a 3-course brunch/lunch for $22.00.  Can&apos;t beat that.  Had the French onion soup, Cobb salad with chicken and chocolate mousse.  Everything delicious.</body>

        <body>Enjoyed lunch at Mon Ami Gabi - perfect onion soup au gratin followed by an excellent seafood crepe.  My daughter enjoyed the quiche.  Portions  were modest, but very rich and flavorful. We loved the trio of tiny desserts - just the right finish to a lovely meal, along with a nice selection of teas.  The room was subdued but lively, and everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals.  I would enthusiastically recommend this bistro to discriminating diners.</body>

        <body>This is one of my favorite places to go. I love the ambiance. We got seated in a back room near the kitchen door. There was a lot of nice &amp; people coming in &amp; out of there. The room itself was tiny &amp; the noise just stayed in there. I prefer to eat in the front. Also, the new system of not showing the # of points you have earned with your Lettuce Entertain You card is annoying. You have to ask for a printout after the server has already rung you up...</body>

        <body>Although this location is in a shopping center [surrounded by other Lettuce restaurants]...once you walk in the door, you forget where you came from. A bit of France in Illinois - as well as Vegas. I come there specifically for their county pate....yum...but the other items on the menu are just as good.  Nice wine list and our server, from Marseilles, was outstanding as well as the rest of the staff. I go there every time I am in town.  I miss it already!</body>

        <body>From the moment we were seated a freshly baked loaf of crusty bread in a parchment bag arrived. It was delicious. We were there for the Restsurant Week lunch, as reviewed by the Chicago Tribune.  My husband had the salmon and I had the steak frites, ending with the trio of desserts. Everything was absolutely delicious! We can not wait to return!</body>

        <body>The staff was very attentive to our needs.  This is really similar to France, were you can stay the entire evening if you wish.  I wasn&apos;t feeling well so I decided to skip dessert and retreat back home.  Even though our reservation was for 6:30, we were seated a little after 6, I thought that was wonderful, as again, I wasn&apos;t feeling well.  I would like to try brunch next time, as our dinner experience was a great experience.</body>

        <body>My reservation was right when then opened for lunch. There were lots of people in line and many tables already seated at 11:30. I was a party of one and instead of seating me in the main dining room with everyone else, they seated me in a small dark room in the back immediately behind the door--yeah. For quite sometime, I was the only table seated in that room...that was until, a single elderly woman was shown to her table. I have fond memories of my wedding shower in that room so I didn&apos;t protest, but the seating choice didn&apos;t make me feel like a truly welcomed guest. The restaurant had just opened so there were a ton of opened tables. It would have been nice to have been invited into the well lit main dining room rather than made to feel marginalized in the table behind the door in the back room. Plus, the servers kept placing dirty plates and other things on the half wall next to my table and pretty much head height. I couldn&apos;t help but think that wouldn&apos;t have seated me there had </body>

        <body>Went here for a special couple dinner to get away from the kids and have some Ono on one time. Mon Ami Gabi was great. Cozy bistro environment with a little hustle and bustle but not over the top. Menu had some good French options that reminded us of our trip to France. The waiter was French and attentive in a realistic French manner.</body>

        <body>We accidentally exchanged credit cards with friends when we went out to eat last week at another establishment.  Needless to say, I did not recognize this and used my friend&apos;s credit card instead of my own.  The server failed to note the discrepancy even though I used my frequent diner card with my own name on it.   Please check names and signatures to make sure they match on the credit card or frequent diner card.  It also led to Open Table questioning us as to whether we were a &quot;no show:.</body>

        <body>Our experience here started out poorly when we were seating right next to the bussing station when 80% of the tables were empty. I probably should have spoken up but I let it go. Even when we left the place was only half full.     Service did not get much better from there. Waitress was no where to be found most of our meal &amp; was not friendly at all. We had two kids with us so maybe that had something to do with the bad seat &amp; the bad service but our kids are 11 &amp; 7 and know how to act in a restaurant.   The food was good but nothing was great.  The pommes frites were hard &amp; half were not edible on all of our plates. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice. The kids&apos; meals were awesome w cool divided dishes &amp; lots of healthy extras.   I would give it another chance &amp; hope we catch them on a better day.</body>

        <body>We have been here before and once again we were not disappointed. The greeter was friendly both when we arrived and when we left. The server was excellent  and the extra people helping were as well. We were not rushed and we enjoyed our time there. This is the first time we were seated in one of the side rooms, which was fine, but I think we liked the main area a little better. It was a bit loud but I think it had more to do with a table we were near as there was a person who&apos;s voice was a bit loud but it was not because he had to much to drink. It didn&apos;t take anything away from our evening though, I think it had more to do with the size of the room we were in. The food was excellent as it has been there the other times we have been there so we were pleased about that as well. Parking can be a bit tricky but it is because of there being other restaurants close by but there is valet parking as well and is reasonable.</body>

        <body>Mon Ami Gabi is an especially lovely place to brunch or lunch. The food is updated French bistro fare, with a nice selection of wines and cocktails. The service is always friendly and professional. The atmosphere has a lively European vibe; grab a seat on the patio weather-permitting for that Parisienne cafe feel.</body>

        <body>I guess they weren&apos;t ready for the lunch crowd? Service was so slow it was like I was actually in Paris. Our waiter was too busy flirting with other staff to pay any attention to us, which made it very difficult to get  his attention when, after an hour of waiting  for our food, we had had to tell him half our order was wrong.  Our corrected order was wrong too. The restaurant did pay for our group&apos;s bill but what good is that when I left without getting my order? This used to be a regular spot, not anymore.</body>

        <body>I made a reservation to celebrate a dear friend&apos;s 60th birthday. I went the extra mile to contact the restaurant personally. I even talked to Lilly to have her give us a good table. I wish we would have had a more private table for 6. We were so close to the other tables that they heard our entire conversation and even got in our group pictures. I also wanted to bring our own champagne. We were willing to pay the cork fee but were not able because if the wine is on their menu they would not allow it. For a milestone birthday I wish Mon Ami Gabi would have made it special. They could have at least given the birthday girl a free desert. Too many al a carte items. An expensive dinner should include a salad or soup with the entre.  The Capital Grill is better for celebrating special occasions.</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve always had a good experience here. Today, my husband&apos;s brunch order of eggs, was overdone. We asked to have it returned and he ordered something else. The manager came over and gave us his personal attention and told us to pick a decadent dessert &quot;on the house&quot;. They really aim to please here and want you to be happy. I noticed the manager also wipes down the menus before the next person gets them, for sanitation purposes.</body>

        <body>Mon Ami is a favorite but first time we tried for lunch. It did not disappoint. Same menu as for dinner with enough lighter choices for those wanting less at lunch. We would have preferred a smaller, lunch sized offering of our favorite, steak frites, but settled for crepes and sandwiches which were very good.</body>

        <body>My sister and I had Easter dinner at Mon Ami Gabi; this was her first visit to the restaurant.  I knew that she would be impressed with the restaurant..  We were seated in a booth  which was perfect!  The music that is played in the restaurant are standards from the American Songbook which is lovely.  Our meal of scallops, squash, and Brussels sprouts were divine!  I did not have to ask for refills of water or ice tea, the servers were on the spot.  Mon Ami Gabi always has outstanding service, food, and great ambience; it is my favorite restaurant.</body>

        <body>We went for Restaurant Week. Very nice and knowledgeable sommelier and server. A Bordeaux from Graves at $54 was a very tasty choice at a good price.  Baked scallop appetizer with toasted cheese topping was flavorful yet light.  Sautéed skate wing with browned butter and caper spaetzle and a slice of browned cauliflower was extremely satisfying.</body>

        <body>The steak classique is my favorite.    As an Open Table member, I did not mind the seventeen minute wait to be seated on a Saturday night.  But I did mind the ten minute wait for the waiter to even introduce himself and ask for the drink orders.  This should not be happening at an upscale French restaurant.</body>

        <body>We enjoyed our visit to Mon Ami Gabi, although there was apparently some confusion about who would be the server for our table initially.  After that, the service was wonderful.  One small quibble, which I have thought before--the portions are so very small.  I would definitely hesitate to go there with couples because I&apos;m certain that the men would not feel that they had enough to eat.  I certainly didn&apos;t feel that I had enough..   It costs very little to add some mashed potatoes or rice  pilaf to a plate.   The quality of the food is very good, however.  Will return but not with guys.</body>

        <body>The service: On a busy Friday night, we had to wait 15-20 minutes after our reservation time to be seated, but hey, two of our party of four arrived ten minutes late anyway.  Nonetheless, without a word from any of us, we were told by the the manager just after being seated that we would be comped an appetizer or dessert -- a nice touch that set the tone for the dining experience.  Our waitress arrived right away and provided pleasant, attentive, informed service throughout the evening.  The food:  Our cocktails were right-on. Oysters on the half shell for appetizers that I thought were only fair (just didn&apos;t have that cool, fresh texture in my mouth and most didn&apos;t arrive with any of the oyster liquor), but my wife thought they were very good.  Two in our party, myself included, ordered the boar which both of us thought was delicious -- rich, but not heavy.  The skate fish was less of a success -- not bad, just not very interesting.  Ambiance:  Great for a night out with friends; pro</body>

        <body>Mon Ami Gami was a great spot for a dinner for just the two of us. Soft lighting in the evening. Parking is a problem on the weekends, so use the valet. Dinner was good, but the timing of the bison steak and my wife&apos;s chicken seemed a little off, her side dishes were barely warm when they were served. The green beans and grilled onions served with my steak were excellently seasoned however.</body>

        <body>We couldn&apos;t make it to dinner until 8:15....so I realize that they were at the end of a busy day.    I did NOT feel rushed by the server, but the food was definitely not what I&apos;d experienced on other occasions at the restaurant.    The service was fine....but the food, not good.   I&apos;ve been there many times and the food has been quite good, so I would chalk this up to the hour.  But in my opinion, regardless of the time you should be able to expect the same quality from your meal.</body>

        <body>My wife and I frequently come here for a great Friday night meal after a long hard work week. Terrific kale salad. Skate wing is wonderful and last night the Artic Char which was the special was superb. And I&apos;m tough to please on fish. Service is excellent; we have been here about 10 times.  Very fair pricing.</body>

        <body>When I say it&apos;s a French restaurant, I mean don&apos;t go there trying to be gluten free, fat free, dairy free, or vegetarian. They cook with butter, yes real butter. I try to eat healthy most of the year, but Valentine&apos;s Day can bring along an exception. The price isn&apos;t bad, but if you drink wine, and they have an ample selection, come with your eyes and wallet open. The food is really good and the portion size is commensurate with the cost. It&apos;s not the type of food you whip up in the kitchen for the family. I definitely recommend it. Valet parking, as of 2/14/2015 is $4.00. Don&apos;t pass that up.</body>

        <body>We chose this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary and we enjoyed  very good food and excellent service. We were given complimentary glasses of champagne to mark the occasion. we particularly liked the side dish of the champagne braised cabbage and the angel food grilled cheese sandwich for dessert. Service was excellent and our server was very knowledgeable of the specials and menu. At times though the support staff seemed to hover a bit and could have been more verbal as to their need to place extra silverware between courses. Of course it&apos;s  location offered a fabulous view of the city an d being a life long resident it really showed the city well. A perfect place to take someone from out of town!</body>

        <body>When I wasn&apos;t sure about the creamed corn, if it were too spicy, they brought me a small dish of it to try first.  Aim to please the customer.  Everything was great - halibut was very good and I got a complementary birthday dessert!</body>

        <body>I though I was a  steak lover, but after dinning on a bacon wrapped salmon I may never eat steak again.  The lobster was tremendous, topped with suckulant crab. A great way to start off dinner is the oyster shooters, very meaty oysters in a great cocktail sauce that doesn&apos;t over power the oysters.  You have to have the bannana topped cheese cake, not too thick and a great crust.  The wait staff did an excellant job of seeing to all our needs.  My wife had some specific diet needs that they were able to accomodate.  Great job, we will be back.</body>

        <body>As part of a private trial run before opening night this weekend, we were treated to a 3 course meal that was randomly selected for each member of our party.  Each and every dish was delicious, beautifully presented and showcased the new menu.  Wonderful improvement to an already great restaurant with the best view in Pittsburgh.</body>

        <body>The fish is to die for. I have never had a more perfectly cook piece of fish in my life. Hot. Seared exterior. Soft and tender interior. And the flavor (specifically, of the Chilean sea bass) was out of this world.  Great view. Beautiful city.</body>

        <body>The renovation was very nice.  There are clean lines and better sight lines from all tables to the magnificent window walls overlooking the Pittsburgh skyline.  The new tapas bar on the lower level is also well done, but no one who greeted us noted the new bar and small plates restaurant and there are no signs pointing to it in the main restaurant.  We had to discover it on our own.  The menu has changed, with fewer options but some new sushi choices.  We were disappointed to no longer see shrimp or crab cocktail on the appetizer list, and especially disappointed that there is only one starch item on the sides list among multiple vegetable choices: the three color potatoes also on the former menu that include sweet potatoes, which we do not prefer.  Gone from the menu are any whipped potato, baked potato or risotto choices.  This is unacceptable to us and I&apos;m sure many Pittsburghers and may result in our not returning soon.  I hope that management will reconsider the removal of these </body>

        <body>We chose the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto for an anniversary celebration. Although it was  a 2 hour drive from our home we were more than pleased with the service and the atmosphere. Debbie (our server) was more than attentive and went out of her way to make the night special.  The food was excellent and Debbie&apos;s recommendations were spot on. Watching the sunset over the Pittsburgh triangle is a once in a lifetime experience. Thank You Monterey Bay and staff for creating a unique experience.</body>

        <body>First of all, our server was absolutely amazing. I can&apos;t remember her name offhand but she was approx mid 50s with short brown hair and had worked at the restaurant for 12 years. She really went above and beyond to make our experience enjoyable. We were in town for just one night and visited this restaurant because it was said to have the best food and view in the city. The view was absolutely stunning but the food was just ok. The crab cake was the best I have ever had, however the fish was not seasoned well. I ordered Chilean sea bass and had to send it back. It was very tough and under seasoned. I had it replaced with halibut which was a bit better but still lacking seasoning. Stuffed scallops were amazing. The restaurant will be doing a complete remodel and I would love to visit again if I ever go back to Pittsburgh but I may stick to shellfish!</body>

        <body>The restaurant has an excellent view of the Pittsburgh city skyline.  If price is not an issue, then you should be satisfied with the very tiny but tasty  portions of food and the excellent service. However, if you have a healthy appetite, I wouldn&apos;t recommend eating here. Dinner with a side and a glass of wine for 2 people will run you about $150.  After dinner, we were still hungry, and stopped for a delicious Mike and Tony&apos;s Gyro. I also did not appreciate the noise level.  I was hoping to have a nice quiet, romantic  dinner with my wife, but the acoustics in the room did not dampen the conversation noise at all.</body>

        <body>Monterey bay was better than expected. We knew it was going to be fancy, unique and expensive, but we knew we were treating ourselves! We got the appetizer sampler, crab bisque soup, swordfish entree and ahi tuna entree with crab Mac &amp; cheese and asparagus .  Everything was amazing. I think the best was the crab cake in the appetizer sampler, but the crab bisque was great too.  Reasonably priced and GREAT service. Newly remodeled with a fantastic view. I have a new favorite fancy place. The grilled cheese dessert was so good, my wife made me shut up while she ate it. We got the bill and really expected to pay more, so we will be back!</body>

        <body>Owning and operating a small restaurant myself, it&apos;s extremely difficult for my wife and I to get away. Our evening at Monterey Bay was the perfect local getaway. The view was stunning to say the least, and the food rivaled the view. Course after course of the most stunningly prepared fresh fish I&apos;ve ever had. And the deserts! Chef Gene is an artist. I could eat the &quot;Grilled Cheese&quot; from not until the moment I die. Heaven on a plate.  Everyone at the Bay was wonderful. We can&apos;t wait to go back!</body>

        <body>Dining at Monterey Bay on Mt. Washington is an experience to be enjoyed by everyone.  The entire staff is friendly from the time your enter until you leave.  The food is always above and beyond all expectations.  The wait staff is professional and attentive to the max.   No one should leave without trying one of the Pastry Chef&apos;s desserts.  Thank you (Eugene) I think is his name, is the best in town.</body>

        <body>View of Pittsburgh 5/5, Service 5/5, Food 3/5 and no better than TGI Friday&apos;s. The fish selection was excellent but the available preparations were boring, unimaginative, and often took away from the fish. I had the evening special king salmon. The glaze was too sweet amd overpowered they fish. Might as well use tasteless tilapia. We also had stuffed yellowtail and again the fish got lost in the overpowering prep. The only very good dishes we had were the ahi tuna and the crab bisque (4+/5). The other bright spot was dessert and I give an excellent 5/5 for the angel food grilled cheese....that&apos;s how to do it!   This is not a place for foodies. I hope that during their upcoming remodel, they remodel the menu and bring some upscale imagination to the menu.</body>

        <body>MONTEREY BAY REMODEL IS AMAZING.  VERY UPSCALE-YET INVITING AND COMFORTABLE.  LOVE THE BOTHS AND AMBIANCE.  ONLY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO REVISE THE SIDE OPTIONS. I LIKE THAT THEY CAN BE SHARED, BUT NOT THE VARIETY.  SHOULD HAVE MORE RICE OR RISOTTO OPTIONS AND IN SEASON VEGETABLES.  THE POTATOES WERE NOTHING SPECIAL-HOWEVER THE ENTREES WERE OUTSTANDING!</body>

        <body>Waiter was good except he seemed to intentionally try to overcharge me 24.00 for combo platter i didnt order. Good thing i looked over my 150.00 bill. His excuse was sorry the tables were split,yet i only had party of two. Just seemed suspicious and it happens regularly to pocket some extra cash.</body>

        <body>Although the view is wonderful, I was disappointed in the food, I had steak which was good bur very small, lobster tail was a disappointment with no flavor and stringy. 2shrimp were on platter which also were mediocre. It was outrageously overpriced. Brussels sprouts were very good but portion was very small. Overall it was a disappointment.</body>

As always the service and ambiance were flawless and the menu selection would satisfy even the pickiest of diners.  The view is incredible and unmatched in the city.</body>

        <body>Monterey Bay is our &apos;go to&apos; favorite for events and when we have friends in from out of town.  The view is the best in the city and the food is consistently outstanding especially their fresh seafood and the desserts.  The décor of the restaurant before the renovation was nice but it was getting a bit &apos;tired&apos; and it couldn&apos;t compete with the view.  The changes they have made really bring Monterey Bay up a notch or two and the addition of the Sakari Lounge and the addition sushi to the menu were big improvements.  They also changed the seating a bit and added booths which was a nice touch.  Our meal there this past weekend was excellent and the service was wonderful.  Hard to imagine a more enjoyable evening.  Kudos on the remodeling.  Definitely a change for the better.</body>

        <body>We picked this restaurant for dinner as the climax of our college visit.  It was the second night after its reopening on 4/4/2015.  It is within walking distance from the incline.  The night view was fantastic.  The view is even better from the Japanese restaurant one floor down.  The food was excellent.  Each member of our group had different order of fish.  The desert was also good.  People can easily spent a whole night here...</body>

        <body>After a wonderful fish dinner at Mallorca on Carson street the night before, I was expecting a highlight dinner at Monterey Bay.  Seated at table C4 near server stand (banging, talking behind me the entire time).   Overpriced - $35 fish dish does not come with anything else - fully a-la-carte like a steak house.   Ran out of Branzino fish.  Under staffed - dirty dishes not cleared - no additional bread offered - poor service.  DO NOT GO TO MONTEREY BAY.  Spend half and go to Mallorca.</body>

        <body>We wanted to take our friends who aren&apos;t from Pittsburgh to a place with a good view and so we picked Monterey Bay. Not only did we have a wonderful view of the city, but we also really enjoy our meals! The waitstaff was wonderful and ambiance was perfect for a night out with friends. I would recommend the crab bisque and the Parmesan Halibit to everyone!</body>

        <body>I have lived in Pittsburgh my entire life and I have never been to this restaurant  before. I loved everything about it, From the elevator ride with the AWESOME view to the AWESOME service(our waitress was Debbie). The food in my opinion was just ok, I most certainly expected more. This location is remodeling and will be closed for 2 months during the renovations and I can not wait to go back and try another dish and see the new remodeled restaurant. Awesome place I strongly recommend it to anyone.</body>

        <body>This was my wife and I first visit to your establishment.  Although we found the setting, service, and atmosphere to be great, both of us were quite disappointed with the food.  The portions were good, however we ordered based upon the description on the menu as well as the server&apos;s input.  On each of our dinners, we found that what was described was not what we expected.  Each of us do not mind paying for a premium on fine food, however we both felt as though our dinners were not as satisfying as expected.  I understand that our meal was provided on the last night before remodeling was to begin.  I am not sure if that had anything to do with our experience.  I would like to visit the restaurant again, however am hesitant based upon what we experienced the first time around.  Thank you.  John Posa</body>

        <body>Our family of eight, including three children under 11 (with one very rambunctious 6 year old boy), were treated fantastically: everything from seating arrangements which were exceedingly flexible around our needs to courteous greeting (with stop-backs) by managers. Waiter was superb -- gave deference to kids and served adults with grace and friendliness. A mid morning lunch was just right for a family with kids. This was our family&apos;s Christmas Treat to each other (included out of towners from Brooklyn).  And the best view in Pittsburgh. You could not have treated us more graciously. I was impressed that this top notch Pittsburgh restaurant also had a great menu and drinks for kids. Our family dined on everything from hot dogs (the six year old) to great fish dishes. Thanks to all the staff from first greeting to the valet parkers, who asked, &quot;Did you enjoy your meal?&quot;  -- and, they sounded like they graciously meant it.  Superb. Thanks again.</body>

        <body>Monterey Bay is consistently excellent in all facets one expects of a dining venue. The service was excellent as was our food. It was a special occasion (a birthday celebration). The flowers I ordered were on the table for us and we received a beautiful complimentary dessert.  If I had one word.......exquisite!</body>

        <body>Although the name of the place is a bit of a mouthful, the atmosphere of the entire place was amazing,  the service was more than ample and was often needed when cruising the menu, which by the way had some of the most wonderful and intriguing dishes to try. The price is worth it, this restaurant gives just as much bang for a buck with all of its persona.</body>

        <body>My favorite seafood spot in Pittsburgh.  You could not ask for a more diverse seafood selection.  The view is always amazing as has the service always been.  I would recommend Monterey Bay to anyone visiting Pittsburgh for the 1st time or any local that has never been there.</body>

        <body>Second time I was there. Once in 2004 for a work dinner. This time, my family got dolled-up and took my seafood-loving dad for his birthday recently on a Sunday evening. The view was fantastic, even on an overcast afternoon. Once the sun went down, the city lights were awesome. The menu was daunting at first, but our server was knowledgeable about how each dish was prepared. Our fish was fresh and the sauces divine! We would recommend the crab cakes and the Chilean sea bass done with a Caribbean flair. Also tasted my mother&apos;s catfish, which was quite mild in flavor and flaky to the touch. The dessert was to die for. I had the creme brulee, and my daughter opted for the white chocolate macadamia mousse. Decent wine selection. Service was rather slow, but they were busy that night. Leave the kids at home and save your pennies. Quite pricey. Quite the experience. A must-try, especially on someone else&apos;s dime!</body>

        <body>We recently visited Monterey Bay for an anniversary dinner. We were initially assigned a table in the middle of the restaurant, with an &quot;ok&quot; view.  During the meal, our server Devin, realizing it was our anniversary, moved us to a window seat when it became available.  The food and ambiance was great.  The view from Monterey Bay of downtown Pittsburgh is fantastic.  Devin and the Monterey Bay staff went the extra mile to make out night very special.  Thank you.</body>

        <body>This restaurant is known around the area for its high marks for sushi, but the question I had in my mind; does it live up to the hype? Morimoto, with out a doubt, is a fantastic restaurant that can keep up with a high demand for remarkable service and great food. I found that I not only had some of the best sushi in the area, but It maintained what I considered the tenets of traditional sushi, without all the frills of some of our americanized sushi market that have butchered great raw fish. It was straight up fish, rice and nori for us. The staff may have been the only thing better than the sushi at Morimoto. I can&apos;t wait for a return to this restaurant to try everything we missed.</body>

        <body>If you are a foodie this play is a must visit.  We did a 8 course meal that allowed the chef to pick each course.  It&apos;s the best way to taste something different and try their best.  Our waiter was excellent and new everything about each dish.  But every once and a while (2 courses) they had someone from the wait staff deliver the dish instead if the waiter and they really struggled explaining or didn&apos;t know what we were trying.  No problem, we just waited for our guy to come back and asked him to explain.  This experience was not cheap at all ($120 per person not including drinks) but it was well worth it.  If it wasn&apos;t for the wait staff doing the periodic plate delivery I would of gave this place 5 stars.  Also, we wanted to see chef Morimoto but I don&apos;t think he was there.  I would definitely go back though.  Well done!!!</body>

        <body>Morimoto isn&apos;t one of the newest places in Philly to eat, but the food is absolutely amazing. The ambiance is still super stylish and unlike any other in the area. If you are a sushi lover and up for adventuresome cuisine, it is the perfect spot.</body>

        <body>We decided to book lunch on the Friday before Valentine&apos;s Day. It was a great experience. Service was excellent. Hostess was welcoming and friendly. Waiter was professional and helpful as was the rest of the serving team. I ordered ala carte, my husband ordered the lunch omekase. We ordered sake; which was delicious. I had the toro tartare, waygu dumplings and sushi.  Everything was great. The uni was outstanding; as was the tobiko with quail. We had a side of the wasabi fried rice which was delicious. The omekase was a treat -- the scallop with scallop risotto and a coddled quail egg  and the sashimi salad were amazing. We are looking forward to a return trip!</body>

        <body>Obviously it&apos;s a wonderful restaurant. Check, check, check. But, come on.... Shrimp tempura appetizer for $16? Covered in gooey sauce? Nope. Sushi was great. And pricey. As is everything else on the menu. Lunch shouldn&apos;t be $150 with no drinks.</body>

        <body>Can&apos;t believe it took us a year in Philadelphia to experience Morimoto when we live around the corner ( maybe as the entrance is relatively obscured). Definitely worth seeking it out. We had a great birthday dinner there.  Modern decor and fantastic umskase meal. Go for the supplement and enjoy the wagu beef and lobster. The oyster preparations were notable.  Excellent  Saki choices. Attentive and knowledgeable service.</body>

        <body>The duck duck duck was good. The surf and turf was better. There was a pretty big puddle of oil at the bottom of the fried rice and I just wasn&apos;t a huge fan of duck egg, but the sauce was unique. The 10-hour pork and the whitefish carpaccio were great. The desserts took the cake. Nick got a meringue tart with passion fruit and mango. Fusion at its best. Why didn&apos;t the French event it this way? I ordered the matcha tres leches. Matcha tres leches. Moist, creamy, beautiful green. With red bean paste to give it even more texture. If you like matcha, this is what you dream about. Moral of the story: eat dessert first, then go for the appetizers.</body>

        <body>This is the best food experience I&apos;ve had in Philadelphia. The depth of flavor in the broths and sauces is unparalleled. And the quality of the proteins and recipes are a revelation. This experience is worth every penny and then some. I truly believe a dinner for two of this caliber at around $200 is a value because one cannot get a better meal in Philadelphia.</body>

        <body>I went to Morimoto to celebrate my birthday. I was traveling on business and it just so happens that I was in Philadelphia for my birthday.   I had the most wonderful time. From the moment I walked in the door until the moment I left I felt like I was cared for by people who truly understand the customer experience.  Justin was my waiter and he is a true gem. He knows the menu inside and out and he completely met all of my needs before I even needed them.  Each time a dish would come to my table the server would present it to me and explain what I was about to experience.   The food was brilliant and delicious. I started simple with a California roll, then came the wagyu dumplings. So savory! The main course was duck breast with duck confit fried rice topped with a duck egg. I was also given a bowl of delicious miso soup that someone else had cancelled from their order (see, he met my needs before I even I needed them). Finally, because it was my birthday, my lovely server, Justin, bo</body>

        <body>when i looked at the sushi menu i was disappointed. it seemed they have only simple sushi and i didn&apos;t understand why it&apos;s so expensive. but oh my god... the fresh fish were the stars! we celebrated our birthday and were pampered by the waiter and the service was amazing! we did the 150$ tasting menu which is expensive but worth it! every dish that came out was a celebration for our pallet. a wow experience by all means. the alcohol was right to our taste and our waiter Raymond was professional, courteous, attentive and knew exactly where to steer us with food and drinks. one of my best Philly restaurants experiences!</body>

        <body>My wife and I went here for our anniversary. We had the calamari salad, scallop ceviche, black cod entree, and wasabi fried rice.  Every bit of the meal was stunning. The calamari was light and crispy, the ceviche thin, light and elevating, and the black cod was cooked to perfection.  And the wasabi fried rice was subtle, savory, and went very nicely with the cod. The decor is a bit too over the top/ funky-modern, with strange white light rods in the middle of the tables that get in the way more than they add to the decor. Other than that, morimito is truly a wonderful experience.</body>

        <body>Morimoto met and exceeded all of our expectations. The hostess and waiter were extremely attentive and polite. Our waiter made great recommendations based on what we said our interests were. The food arrived in a timely manner. We had the uni carbonara, which was served with a quail egg and uni on top and so delicious! The pasta was creamy and was of good portion size. We had the baby eel sushi for the first time, which was not our favorite but had the consistency of cold noodles. We had uni sushi, which was of great quality. We also had spicy tuna - oh so good!, soft shell crab sushi roll - omg!, and eel-avocado-a classic! We had an amazing time. The ambiance was perfect for many different types of occassions - business dinners, dinner with a group, or even a romantic meal. Would definitely recommend and will be coming again!</body>

        <body>I had the 8 course omakase and it was wonderful, the sushi and sashimi were beautiful, the wagu beef was heaven on a plate, the toro tartar in dashi was exceptional and the 3 glasses of wine from the list were perfect. The only low point was the sauteed lobster with spices, the spices overwhelmed the lobster. That aside it was a great meal.</body>

We ended up with several appetizers and sushi rolls versus going the entree route which we really enjoyed.  it was our first visit and we wanted to try a lot of different things.  there are also 2 prix fixe tasting menus.</body>

        <body>I had the seasonal selection of King Yellowtail sashimi, a Spicy Tuna Roll, and the Wagyu Beef which was all excellent. My wife had the rock shrimp tempura (which was good) and then the Sea Bass which was absolutely terrible. I tasted it because she actually thought it may be bad or spoiled. I don&apos;t send food back at restaurants so she just ate some of mine which was a much better meal. I have been here a dozen or so times and I am in borderline disbelief that the sea bass left the kitchen</body>

        <body>Comfortable mood lighting makes it an inviting experience. The service was excellent and our plates came out very well timed. There are private dining rooms for parties and groups as well. The open floor makes for a slightly loud and rowdy room at times.</body>

        <body>Very little has changed at Morimoto since it opened ten years ago. It&apos;s still fabulous and amongst the finest Philly restaurants.   Upon seeing the room for the first time, I thought it would get stale quickly but now I actually think the opposite. Maybe they&apos;ll need to switch out the tables someday, but the room itself is so beautiful and original that it&apos;ll always be stunning.   The food has held up just as well. It is always delicious.</body>

        <body>Hands down, this was one of the best meals I&apos;ve ever had in my life. I wish I could eat here every week because I wanted to try absolutely everything on the menu.  First off, the decor is amazing. It&apos;s very modern and reminded me a lot of one of the restaurants that was in the movie &quot;Her.&quot; The service was also fantastic. Our server was so attentive and she was quick to refill glasses, offer suggestions, or just stop by to see how we were doing. Honestly, I&apos;d give this place 5 stars based on service alone.  But, let&apos;s be real, we all care the most about the food and it did not disappoint. We had a group of 6 and we all ordered something different. We got the Morimoto Tempura (the bacon-wrapped mozz was my own personal heaven), Foie Gras (amazing), Pork Kakuni (even more amazing), and the Wagyu Dumplings (maybe the most amazing). Honestly, we would have tried every appetizer if we had the time (and stomach room).   The showstoppers were the entrees though. I got the Uni Carbona, which w</body>

        <body>I received excellent service and really good seafood! I visited on a Valentine&apos;s date, but aside from the scenery, the noise level (as well as inconsistency in dress code) kept my experience from being as romantic as I had hoped.   I will certainly visit again...just with a different expectation.  Awesome service by the way!</body>

        <body>I am glad we visited Morimoto&apos;s. It was worth a stop while in Philadelphia. However, neither the price nor the quality would justify going out of one&apos;s way. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I enjoyed our visit; but, after spending nearly $300, we left feeling a bit unfulfilled. The sushi just wasn&apos;t as good as we had hoped for. Nothing about the sushi wow&apos;ed us. Delicious to be sure, but, not $300 delicious.  That said, the wasabi fried rice and sake were good. The cake was good too.  So, bottomline... decent but overpriced.</body>

        <body>My son was extremely excited about going to Morimoto&apos;s for his birthday and he was not disappointed.  He got the $150 Omakasi and the beverage Omakasi.  The food as usual was excellent.  Our waiter is the best - he is knowledgeable, he takes the time to explain the food, where it originated which makes the experience even better.  The rest of your staff is also amazing.  We went to the lounge before dinner and they really took care of us.  All night different people would come around, clear the table, ask how things were, my son thought it was great that he got new utensils &amp; chop sticks every course.  Your employees are definitely team players, no one was afraid to clear a dirty plate.  Your staff brings service to a whole new level, something you do not get anywhere else.  My son and i have discussed this several time since being there.  My son loves fine dining so we do go out a lot, nothing compares to Morimoto&apos;s, Thank you for making my son&apos;s birthday special.</body>

        <body>I was a bit annoyed when we showed up on time and we still needed to wait 15 minutes for our 6:30 reservation... there were plenty of tables, so I don&apos;t know why we had to wait.  The hostess was completely unapologetic and quite obnoxious.  She should be fired instantly.  Once seated, however, the evening was perfect!  Our server, Aileen, I think. was super attentive and very knowledgeable about everything on the menu!  Delivery of drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts was scheduled with perfect timing.  Each course was skillfully prepared and executed as though Mr. Morimoto was standing behind all the chefs breathing down their necks watching their every move and thought.  All in all, it was a very memorable dining experience that I highly suggest one makes time for when in Philadelphia.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been dining several times at Morimoto for their sushi over the past few years, I&apos;ve tried it twice in the past sixt months. After a desappointing experience, I decided it was time to try it again and the verdict remains the same. The sushi used to be excellent and they are now just above average. Above average is not good enough to justify the price. Might have something  to do with the opening of a Morimoto restaurant in NYC. In any case, I won&apos;t be back.</body>

        <body>We adore Morimoto for the interior design and delicious Japanese cuisine.  If you walk past the front of this restaurant, you will see it&apos;s minimalistic exterior would not give away the secret of what&apos;s inside.  The designer is a well known world-renowned designer, Karim Rashid.  The booth spaces on the main dining floor undulate with colors and wash over the entire space.  This backdrop is a perfect theatrical counterpart to the meal.    Go for soup or appetizers if you don&apos;t want to spring for the full meal - just to see the place!  It is a bit expensive but worth it for the special ambience.</body>

        <body>While I love the food, considering the prices I was a little put off by the service.   We had 2 orders that were incorrect, empty plates that lingered for quite a while, a server that constantly interrupted conversations mid sentence,  And while the table side food preparation was nice, sometimes it felt like the show was about the server entertaining us with endless details rather than just getting our food with polite courteous information.  But the food was great!</body>

        <body>I went to Morimoto&apos;s to celebrate a birthday. The food  was delicious and the service was impeccable. The waitperson gave good recommendations for menu selections.  Our dinner was delayed a bit so we were given a free dessert which tasted better than the one we ordered!   We will be returning soon.</body>

        <body>The atmosphere at Morimoto is vibrant and very modern, with eye-catching cutouts on the wall, and a nice dining room set up that provides diners individual sections without seeming boxy. The food was absolutely delicious (the tuna sashimi was the best bite of fish I&apos;ve ever had), and everything was fresh and well flavored. We went to experience &apos;Iron Chef&apos; level food, and weren&apos;t disappointed. I especially enjoyed that the dishes weren&apos;t overcomplicated, but rather delivered exactly what the menu described. The service was great as well.   The only discount I would have is that we originally walked straight past the restaurant, since it is slightly set back and the name is on a window.</body>

        <body>I opted for the chef&apos;s tasting (omakase) which was 8 courses of various items on the menu, and some not on the menu. I paired it with the sake tasting and had the best meal of my life. The food was amazing, the service was fantastic, and it was overall a great way to enjoy my first night in Philadelphia.  Highly recommend eating there if you get to Philadelphia.</body>

        <body>It was my birthday and I selected the Omakase as a special treat after hearing about and reading about it.  During the tasting, there were no bad courses, only good or great courses.  One of my favorites was a delicious red snapper in a broth that had really wonderful flavors. My favorite course was the wagyu beef course, the beef was grilled to perfection and melted in my mouth.  The only downside of the night was having to wait a really long time (about 10 minutes) before my 7th course was served (sushi course) but our waiter was on top of it, apologizing for the delay and giving us a digestive for the delay.  Overall, it was an excellent meal and restaurant that deserves all of the accolades that it receives for both the meal and great service.</body>

        <body>My family have experienced many enjoyable meals at Morimoto- our meal last night therefore came as a unpleasant and disappointing surprise. Much of the food quality was sub-par and the service was uncharacteristically slow. Each of us ordered the $120 omikase meal - we had done this several times previously and gave rave reviews for the taste and presentation. The server asked about our prior visits and I&apos;m afraid altered the constituents of the omikase to attempt to avoid overlap with our prior meals. Prior to ordering, we asked whether oysters were possibly included in the selections. Our server stated they were not. It came as a huge surprise seeing that the omikase served to the couple across the aisle included oysters as the first course. We paid extra for our oysters, receiving fewer than if they had been equally included. Our first course included a &quot;slow boiled egg&quot; with uni - two of our party found it unacceptable in taste. Our second course was one of their daily specials &quot;M</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been here in previous years, it appears as if there is a decline in both quality and service. I&apos;ll give it another chance but it is still a great place to eat. Just not as great.</body>

        <body>Delicious food. Excellent menu. Attentive wait staff. The ambiance was very calming and unique. It felt like we were under the ocean. The pot du Creme dessert is one of the best desserts I&apos;ve ever had!  We will be going back the next time we&apos;re in Philly.</body>

        <body>sat at sushi bar. Music is way too loud. The waiter was enthusiastic and mentioned many times during the dinner how expensive the Japanese beef course was, and that the restaurant loses money serving it. Despite me trying to tell him I didn&apos;t need all the information he was giving me about the food, he insisted on telling me anyway. I have eaten wagyu beef before, yet he assumed I had no previous experience eating any Japanese food. His telling me that the two tiny pieces of beef , delicious though they were, cost $100 was really annoying. He popped up every few minutes getting pretty annoying -I don&apos;t mind being asked once or twice how my dinner is, but he probably did that more than 10 times. However, the food made the ordeal worth it; it was delicious.</body>

        <body>We came from California early to Philly just so we could have dinner at Morimoto. We were there last Spring and totally loved it, and this time it was just as great as we remembered, and had to share the experience my husband this time around.  The food is so delicious, and the drink menu is fun, creative cocktails that complement the epicurean experience. Loved it!!!</body>

        <body>There was a hair in my entree, which was incredibly disappointing. I expect higher from a restaurant that charges $30+ for entrees. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and were both disappointed with our evening. The waiter did remedy the situation and offer to replace my entree, but the entire mood of the evening was already spoiled.</body>

        <body>We took our daughter for her 16th birthday.  She wanted a unique Japanese food experience and she got it.  We went with the more exotic tasting menu with eight courses.  Most of the courses were outstanding deserving 5 out of 5 stars, if not higher.  From the raw bar to prime wagyu steak, Morimotos exceeded expectations.  The only disappointment and only reason I did not give all 5 out of 5s was dessert. I would have gladly traded the dessert for another main dish and skipped dessert.  Overall, a very worthwhile experience to be enjoyed.</body>

        <body>Knowing that this was Morimoto&apos;s place, I was expecting the ambiance to be incredible.  Although it is stylish, it is basically just a plain rectangle with tables for two on the sides and a bank of double 4 seats in the middle.   The staff however were amazing!  There always seemed to be someone right there when you needed something, but were never interrupting.  That&apos;s a serious talent. The food was, of course, wonderful.  We had scallops for appetizer, my wife had the crispy duck and I tackled roasted bone marrow and a selection of nigiri.  There were many choices in ice creams for desert, but with the weather below 0 Celsius, I was hoping for something warmer.  Lemon raspberry tart and a chocolate sesame cake were just right. Over all,  the staff was fantastic, the food was great, and the evening was wonderful.</body>

        <body>My wife and I loved the set-up of the restaurant and it has a great atmosphere. Overall the service was excellent and our waitress was knowledgeable and outgoing. My wife and I split an appetizer, each had an entrée, and split a desert.  They had a nice variety of different types of mixed drinks and the 2 that we tried were very good. All the food was great but I wasn’t a fan of the portion size and I ended up leaving the restaurant still hungry which is one of my biggest pet peeves. Outside of leaving hungry we had a great experience. If we go there again then I would make sure to add on a soup or another appetizer.</body>

        <body>Again Morimoto did not disappoint.  The food was delicious and my daughter was made to feel &quot;important and special&quot; as it was her 15th birthday without the embarrassing singing at the table.  Best dish?  The tofu at the table by far!</body>

        <body>My wife and I have been to Morimoto several times in the past and thought it was time to bring our 12 &amp; 14-year old sons. I have taught them how to dress, behave, order, eat, and tip in such a restaurant and I expect the staff to treat them like any other customer. The staff at Morimoto was the most professional I have seen at any fine dining restaurant regarding handling  the children. They bent over backwards to get us 4 seats together at the sushi bar. The server asked the children for their order instead of us and checked with them to see how the meals were.  And they were great.  From the toro tartare to the pork belly to the roasted bone marrow to the most exquisite sushi, the meal was extraordinary. We asked about the live Sawagani crabs at the sushi bar and after an explanation, 4 showed up for us to share. The server recommended some Japanese Whiskeys to a dedicated Maker&apos;s Mark drinker. We all left full but still wanting more.   As Morimoto expands his restaurant empire arou</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve eaten at Morimoto&apos;s in the past but never tried the tasting menu.  This trip one of us ordered the Omakase.  At $120 or $150 (depending on the type of ingredients used) it&apos;s not cheap but it certainly was delicious.  It goes without saying that all sushi items were prepared from the freshest fish and other ingredients.  Tuna tartar with caviar topping was by far our favorite appetizer - it came with a soy broth which was rich and unctuous.  For stand alone entrees the black cod miso was perfectly cooked and delicately flavored, while Morimoto&apos;s version of surf and turf - Kobe and Hamachi was unique and spicy.  The knife cuts make the Hamachi stand out and it&apos;s very lightly flavored.  The best item of the meal without argument is the spicy Wasabi Fried rice- which tastes exactly how it&apos;s named.  The only warning is that it&apos;s flavors are strong so if you eat it with fish it drowns out the taste.  Dessert was a yuzu meringue - light, delicately browned on the edges and flavored tar</body>

        <body>As sushi can be it can add up in cost but everything was delicious and well worth it.  I can&apos;t wait to bring my husband here next time I come for a business trip, I know he will enjoy everything on the menu.  The decor was very interesting and calming too after a stressful day in the Convention Center.  Much better than the ambiance in the Chinatown sushi places.  I can&apos;t wait to come back.</body>

King crap appetizer, not cut properly,  this was a mess to eat We had both the steak and crunchy fish entrees- very good  Service was OK, lots of &quot;how was everything&quot; but the waiter did not know the menu well and was just getting it done.

        <body>Went to dinner at Morimoto on a Saturday night and had a wonderful experience. The food, service, and ambience were particularly stellar and the price range was just right for the high quality of food and wine that you receive. I would highly recommend Morimoto for any occasion.</body>

        <body>I took friends out to dinner at a restaurant of their choice.  They picked Morimoto because it is their favorite. I was a bit concerned not being a sushi person.  I was thrilled that  there was still plenty to eat other than sushi and all was fantastic.  Also, great dessert!</body>

        <body>One of the most amazing meals I have ever had.   All staff were very knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu.  Every bite was wonderful and had a mild blossoming of flavor even after the initial intro to the palate.  All food was prepared perfectly.  While we splurged, it would be possible to get some wonderful food here at under $30.00.  I believe all the cuisine is Japanese except for the desserts, but the array of choices is such that I believe someone would enjoy the experience and have a great meal even if they were not fans of traditional Japanese fare.  The restaurant&apos;s ambience is clean and simple.  All in all a great experience.</body>

The server was very knowledgeable about the food and drink menu.  Portions average size for a similar restaurant.  Very nice sauces and dressings, very fresh seafood.  Some unusual types of sushi available.</body>

We had a great time - from the start at the upper lounge and all the way through our meal - everything from the drinks to the food to the service were excellent.  Especially good: Morimoto Martini, Lychee Martini, Chilean Sea Bass, Coconut Sorbet.  I would recommend a night at Morimoto&apos;s to anyone that likes Sushi and Japanese-inspired dishes.</body>

        <body>My wife and I decided to splurge on the more luxurious version of the 2 omakasse options.  We were pleased that we did the tasting menu.  The staff were very attentive and prompt while not being intrusive.  The food was spectacular and delicious.  Ironically, the only two courses in the tasting menu that were less-than creative and interesting were the Sashimi and the Sushi courses.  The sashimi and sushi were quite good, but nothing you couldn&apos;t find at any good neighborhood sushi bar.  The other 6 courses were spectacular, inventive, surprising, and quite delicious.  Love this place!</body>

        <body>I think I am getting to repetitive about this place.  Morimoto is just amazing, food, service, bar etc...  Its much smaller than the NYC location but still has a great menu.  Service was very good and attentive.  Recommend sushi lovers and non sushi lovers alike.  A cant miss spot.</body>

        <body>The customer service was top notch. I was taken care of on every level. When waiting, everyone spoke to us with a smile and it didn&apos;t matter if they were &quot;our&quot; server. If an employee saw we needed something, they hopped to it and didn&apos;t hesitate or go look for Alexander. Not to say Alexander wasn&apos;t on top of it. He was amazing and handled everything we asked in a very timely manner.   The food was pricey which hurt my feelings that I couldn&apos;t leave Alexander a bigger tip. The food itself was very good but it didn&apos;t blow me away. We had the Seafood Teban Yaki (no clue how to spell it) and it was good, but I guess seafood can only get but so good. The &quot;duck duck duck&quot; was perfection. I wish I would have gotten two because picking off of my ladies plate just wasn&apos;t satisfying enough.  The lounge upstairs was extremely comfortable and the service continued up there. We waited for our table and again, smiles every where.  The ambiance was very comfortable and it seemed kind of crowded. The</body>

        <body>There should be other choices for &apos;noise level&apos;.. and &apos;would you recommend to a friend.&apos; First of all would have to say it&apos;s very popular and the food is pretty good.. not &apos;great&apos;.. but much better than most. But on a busy Saturday be prepared to be shouting at your dinner companions for the entire meal. Energetic just does not accurately describe it.. ear-splitting would be more accurate. So any recommendation would have to come with that caveat... if it doesn&apos;t bother you much, you&apos;ll probably enjoy your experience. Otherwise, would suggest try visiting during the week when the crowds might not be as &apos;intense.&apos;</body>

        <body>We ordered the 9 course tasting menu to split between 2 (having still been full from La Toque last night).  Everything was incredible, especially the sashimi.  We weren&apos;t too thrilled with the Surf and Turf entree.  The scallops in it were outstanding, but the steak and the pork belly were rather tough.  Otherwise, incredible.</body>

        <body>My wife and I went to Morimoto&apos;s to celebrate our anniversary. Communication was excellent from the front of the house to the wait staff. The waitress was very knowledgeable. She described, in great detail, every dish we asked about. We couldn&apos;t decide so we had the Morimoto Omakase. It was a multi course meal that featured the essence of Morimoto cuisine. I always thought having such small portions would leave me still hungry but, my wife and I could not finish our last course. But overall excellent meal. We did go on a Friday night and it was a little loud and has to ask the waitress to repeat most of her explanations of each offering. Other then that, I will return to Morimoto&apos;s and recommend it to everyone!</body>

        <body>Food, service and cocktails keep us coming back to Morimoto. We routinely dine outside; however, the time of day and weather forced us inside.  Here is the issue: the music  Do the opposite of Nigel in Spinal Tap and go one lower. I do not need techno music for a rhythmic gymnastic performance either.  The music does not accompany the food or the other elements of the overall ambiance.  Once again, all other elements make this a great experience.</body>

        <body>Our server Cristal made our first experience dining here a blast. She explained each dish with intricate detail and also explained how to go about devouring the delicious looking food placed in front of you. The bone marrow was absolutely astonishing, I for one would never try something like bone marrow because it just sounds nasty. But this place can make even the nastiest sounding food taste delicious, and that was just the appetizer! My S.O and I tried the duck duck goose entre which was also quite good, the kicker was their amazing dessert menu. Try the fiery chocolate tart. You won&apos;t regret it.</body>

        <body>Did the chef&apos;s tasting at $120 per person. Interesting complex food and the dessert totally blew us away with its complex flavors &amp; textures. It was the only dish that was &quot;Iron Chef&quot;-worthy, in my opinion.  Service was only okay, which is disappointing for a place of this price &amp; reputation.   Worth going once, to experience it, but there are better, cheaper options in the Napa Valley.</body>

        <body>As you sit down, you note the place setting design and unusual chopsticks.  No matter what you order, every element is perfect.  We had a new rib dish and it was elevated so much so that we craved the recipe (not that I can easily find Kurobata pork).  One of the best ways to enjoy the place is to order many small plates and taste as much as you can.    We had never ordered sushi - sushi is sushi, right? - but we tried a roll this time and it was sublime. I&apos;m not sure there are any misses possible here.  The house sake is a particularly good complement to the meal.</body>

        <body>I was disappointed with my dining experience last week. Hostesses were not very friendly and were disinterested. They were probably feeding off the distracting noises from the kitchen nearby. We were sat at a corner table with no view. I didn&apos;t mind since we went for the food and conversation. Our server ( she didn&apos;t give us her name ) made it difficult for either. No explanations of the menu or food preparations ( she probably thought we ate there all the time ) were provided, but she did point out what they were out of. She seemed rushed to have our orders , so we probably didn&apos;t order what we really wanted just to get her out of our way so we could converse. I&apos;ve actually been to two other Morimoto&apos;s with the same menu. The food quality is comparable, but the service is lacking here.</body>

        <body>My  birthday dinner was spectacular at Morimoto.  My husband is a meat eater and I love raw fish.  He brought me here wondering if there would be anything on the menu that he would like.  Wow!  Not only did he splurge for the Wagu Beef, but got carried away by some of the sushi offerings as well.  A big step for him.  I adored the Hamachi Sashimi with the Fresno peppers...Yikes!  We both loved the popcorn shrimp as an appetizer (not what you&apos;re thinking...so delicately coated and fried that it was like eating soft pearls of goodness!). Topped it off by some perfectly made cocktails and a surprise dessert.  We were well cared for by Matthew, our server, who couldn&apos;t have been more gracious, informative and efficiently low key.</body>

        <body>My husband and I ate dinner here on jan 1, 2015; it was our third visit. We never tried omakase since we wanted to taste different things and we will get too full with an omakase menu. We had the morimoto sushi first which was very hard to eat. :( it tasted great but the layers and the slippery chopsticks made it difficult for us to get the 5layered fish. It was interesting to dip into 5 sauces but the unagi sauce was the winner for us. Grilled octopus was superb - soft not gaimy. The sea urchin carbonara was good but too rich and creamy for me so i wound up asking for pieces of the black cod from my husband which was sooo good btw. We had the omakase dessert which was a good light coconut dish with poprocks at the bottom! Interesting experience and brought us back to our childhood. :) anyhow, our server was super helpful and even brought us free proseca glasses compliments of our B&amp;B old world inn (thank u!). Overall, food is great and the service is excellent. But I suggest iron che</body>

        <body>The restaurant is well located and with a nice decoration. Service was excellent and the menu has a lot of options from cold appetizers (my favorite) to hot entrees. The general manager (Eduardo) seems to have everything under control here. He talks with customers and sees that everything is up to their expectations. I, definitely, recommend this place.</body>

        <body>I chose the Omakase which allows the chef to showcase his talents.  Each tasting was prepared with skill and imagination. It was a delicious meal!  Even the mango dessert was surprisingly good, because of the fact that I don&apos;t normally eat that particular fruit.  They will keep a record of what you have eaten, so each Omakase that you order in the future will be something new for you to experience.  That is unique!</body>

        <body>My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our 8 year anniversary and from the beginning to the end of our experience was special. From the complimentary champagne and appetizers to the yummy $90 platter of sushi that we ordered. The waiters wet attentive and made our dinner memorable.   The sushi was so fresh and sushi chef Jason did an awesome job!</body>

        <body>My wife loved everything about her birthday dinner here. The shrimp appetizers were excellent as well as the pork chop entree. Sake martini was excellent too! The price of the meal was reasonable due to the exceptionally large portions, leaving very little room for dessert. Overall an excellent dining experience.</body>

        <body>We had the Oh-Toro Nigiri, Saba Nigiri, Smoked Salmon Nigiri (my personal favorite).  All exceptional! Then we tried the Sticky Ribs. It&apos;s beyond me how they can make these ribs so fall off the bone tender with a wonderful crispness.  The Wagyu beef was amazing and being one of those items on the menu that you would want to try at least once in a life time.  Because this was a special day for me and my husband our waiter surprised us with an ice cream desert and candle (cherry ice cream with a small square of chocolate)....just right to finish off a wonderful meal and experience at this great restaurant.</body>

        <body>The Morimoto Omakase is the way to go if you are open to trying different dishes since it&apos;s a 6 course meal which the chef&apos;s chooses along with champagne and dessert!  Everything was excellent; food and service! I will definitely come back now that I&apos;ve tried a wide variety!</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve eaten at Morimoto&apos;s a dozen times. It never ceases to amaze. It can be quite loud, so be prepared. The sushi is always fresh and brilliantly displayed. The wagyu beef is fantastic. The duck confit rice is hidden away on the side dish menu and should NOT be missed. Several times it seems Amir has been our server and he is both gracious and an expert at suggesting new things to try, including wines. I highly recommend all 3 kinds of tuna, live octopus, &amp; amberjack when in season.</body>

        <body>Second time here and it didn&apos;t disappoint! Food was amazing, as always. Great and attentive service. Food was amazing! Let me say it again, food was amazing!  We did the 6-course omakase lunch and it was worth every penny.  Will not hesitate to go back again and again and try the other dishes on the menu. Extensive wine and sake list; they also offer shochu and other cocktails. Overall memorable food experience!</body>

        <body>The place is so cute and fun for cocktails, but DO NOT go there if you want to eat yummy food. Besides the shishito peppers, everything else we ordered was really heavy and a HUGE disappointment. Even the sushi rolls we got were not good. I used to watch food network all the time, and couldn&apos;t wait to try Morimoto restaurant while in Napa, and it was an epic failure. I would never go back, if not for just some shishito peppers and cocktails at the bar.</body>

        <body>Beautiful modern decor. Liked passing the open kitchen into the dining area.  We had the 6 course tasting menu and we were not disappointed.  The food was impeccable, fresh and creative.  Elegant plating, Perfect timing and thoughtful service. Only suggestion is acoustic dampening.</body>

        <body>While this is not a restaurant in which to conduct a quiet conversation, it hits on nearly every other level. The server had the good sense to note that we were waiting a while for our initial order and asked his manager to come over and take care of us and she did a very competent job of doing that. The night before dining here I spoke to a young man who cooked at the Napa Morimoto for three years and he made some strong recommendations. The Morimoto Sashimi is a work of art and quite delicious. With that dish you even get to do some painting of sorts with a variety of sauces. The spicy King crab is also a winner.A great comfort dish was the chicken noodle soup or Ramen.The one dish that I did find out of place was the duck duck goose. In my estimation it was very much a one note dish. Albeit a nice note but still one note. Also enjoyed a spot prawn dish that contained Santa Barbara spot prawns that had just arrived two hours before. All in all an amazing experience.</body>

        <body>It was a pleasure to come to Morimoto Napa for the first time.  Beautiful restaurant.  Excellent food.Looking forward to coming back for the Bahn Mi sandwich and the Noodle bowls.  The waiter however, was an irritant.  An older gentleman who was hard to understand and didn&apos;t speak very loud.  My husband is very hard of hearing with two hearing aids so he heard nothing the whole lunch.   The waiter thought it best to make decisions for me and I found that I didn&apos;t have a choice in a few matters.  I felt handled and I do not like spending money in a fine restaurant that way.  I will be back to sit outside and eat and make sure I don&apos;t have that waiter..</body>

        <body>Four of us sat outside watching night fall and passersby. And ordered heavily. The food was just not that great. The king crab was doused in an overly spicy sauce (though we normally love spicy) that overwhelmed what little flavor the crab had. Shishitos were overdone, the rice on the sushi was not well prepared, it was overall a bit embarrassing, I hate to say.</body>

        <body>Food was awesome like other locations. However, the service was below Average.... very slow :(  Interior design was nicely done but all the hard surfaces make the space very noisy during the peak hours. We loved it but the customers who were on a date had to shout across the tables.... It was awkward for them ;)</body>

        <body>The food was great. Service, ambiance all was good. This definitely is not a quick stop for lunch, but more of a leisurely, don&apos;t have to get back to the office right away.  I definitely will  go back and try again.  It&apos;s pricey so I would save for a special occasion and try an evening meal.</body>

        <body>I came here with my husband on our honeymoon as it was highly recommended by a Friend and we&apos;re so glad we did. we are big sushi fans and we tried fish that we&apos;ve never tried before--their selection is incredible!! The service was phenominal as well. Our server, Christal was honest about the menu and told us exactly what we needed to order. She also brought us a dessert that was not on the menu and OMG it was epicurean heaven!  I can&apos;t wait to come back</body>

        <body>I didn&apos;t check &quot;notable wine list&quot; because Morimoto specializes in upscale sakes. It is an educational experience to read the offerings and luckily the staff can be very helpful with selection and tasting. Food is always wonderful and fresh and I do enjoy going there. The surroundings can be cold and noisy, however,  because of the concrete floors.</body>

        <body>As I was saying above it is pricey, spent 200$ for two people and that was with a couple beers on there and dessert. So you could easily drop that down to low 100&apos;s but we were like Eff it, it&apos;s Mori&quot;effing&quot;moto&apos;s joint. Also saw him come in so that was cool. His risotto was insane, I has surf and turf, very small portions but I&apos;m a big guy so getting 2-3 ounce weygu and 8 smalllll strips of yellowtail sashimi was not exactly filling. Thankfully we ordered a couple maki rolls for appetizer so it was perfect.</body>

        <body>We were absolutely impressed with our sushi chef, I&apos;d like to add that he was only 23 years old but extremely talented. I told him we wanted our servings to be unique and adventurous. He succeeded! Everything was fresh and delicious, we seriously couldn&apos;t stop ourselves from ordering. We were so happy with the overall experience. I love the vibe of this restaurant, very fun. We will definitely visit this place again.</body>

        <body>My husband and I changed our reservations from another location to Morimoto for our last evening in Napa.  What a GREAT move!  While we had to wait until 8:45~ it was worth the wait.  We arrived early in hopes of getting sat ~ but once we got a seat at the bar, we didn&apos;t care.  After a week in Napa~ i.e., a lot of wine, the mixology of the bartenders was a welcome diversion for our palates.  I ordered the White Lily and our server later recommended the French Smash.  Both were WONDERFUL.  When we were sat, we had a &quot;quiet&quot; seat in the back of the restaurant, next to the window and were able to enjoy a romantic dinner ~ even with the next guests sitting only 3 feet away.  We enjoyed a menu overview from our server- who was very educated on all of the items.  As we are true foodies and my husband will eat ANYTHING, we asked for her recommendations and went with that.  We started with the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio~ a MUST.  My husband had every winter sushi special that they had (they were on</body>

        <body>We were very excited to be going a restaurant of our all-time favorite Iron Chef.  The ambiance and crowd were very attractive.  It was a very busy evening so the service wasn&apos;t at par.  The waiter was very busy and didn&apos;t spend much time to give us attention.  All the staffs were running around.  Ingredients were very fresh, but the food seems gimmicky.  The Toro Tartar was excellent by itself without all the fancy sauces (ie sour cream?).  I do want to say that the addition of the rice cracker does add a nice texture and the presentation was very cool.  The same for the Morimoto shashimi.  I wasn&apos;t a big fan of them layering all the different fishes into a single bite nor the sauces in the syringes.    Again, presentation was very cool and made it fun.  The entrees were good but nothing spectacular.  Our favorite dishes were the Kakuni and the  Buri Bop.  They were simple traditional dishes, comforting food, with a modern twist, and made with delicious flavor.</body>

        <body>Morimoto&apos;s is a nice restaurant but I gave it three stars because nothing my husband and I ate was great. Perhaps, bc it&apos;s Morimoto, we were expecting a lot more. However, sushi rolls were very plain, appetizers were bland and even the chicken noodle soup was bland with just two bite size morsels of chicken.  Our server was busy and it was difficult to get everything we needed from him.  Although we ate everything, we left the restaurant both saying &quot;this was just not exciting&quot;. There are SEVERAL better options.</body>

        <body>Omokase is outstanding except for the entree choices of Thai coconut sauced fish or pork chop on top of a bed of kim chee. What?? Both non-japanese choices. I came for a Japanese experience not Thai nor Korean. The pork chop over kim chee was terrible as too strong after delightful, delectable Japanese appetizers.  Both of us couldn&apos;t eat it. Beef carpaccio , sushi, hamachi was excellent quality . Waiter, Amir, was rude and condescending. For him to reply, &quot;I only work , here&quot; is not professional from a higher end restaurant. Other wait staff were excellent and service conscious. Waiter did not even ask if coffee desired or if anything needed, etc. We had to scout out the bus boy for coffee, which he gladly provided.</body>

        <body>This restaurant is fantastic.  It is HUGE! But still quite comfortable.  Very nicely designed.  Love the grape vines on the walls.  I had what was essentially a Japanese Bouillabaisse.  It was exceptional  My husband had a soup to start and an excellent black cod. For dessert he had the Monkey Bread and I had this huge chocolate bomb that I swear was one of the top ten desserts of my life - and I love dessert!  We had a lovely waiter who made great suggestions - particularly when it came time to choose dessert wines - which were spectacular - the Davis Late Harvest Cab Franc being the best -  I have to find and bring home with me.</body>

        <body>When arriving the hostesses seemed preoccupied. We had a reservation at 845 and didn&apos;t get sat till 905. They talked to every other party waiting updating them on their reservation (those who came before and after us). Finally after 905, they called us because our table was ready. The server started off really attentive and friendly. But as the night went on he stopped checking in on us and seemed a bit irritated that we didn&apos;t order dessert. Well we were stuffed from the 4 appetizers, our entrees and the drinks we ordered. He took forever to bring us the check, run our card and bring our check back. He didn&apos;t give us a pen to sign it and had to wait even longer. He never came back so we had to ask one of the other staff for help. Our servers service went from 10-2. He&apos;s lucky the food was good and the rest of the staff stepped up for him.</body>

        <body>The restaurant atmosphere is like a high-end martini bar.  Constant back beat, edgy minimalist decoration, loud.  More like being in a club than a restaurant.  The high point is the freshness of the food and the presentation.  But it&apos;s hit or miss in terms of the food preparation and quality.  All of the food is above average, but it&apos;s just not all exceptional, which it should be at this price point.  Some of the food will surprise you, others are slightly better than high end bar food.  The service is average, and our waitress was not very knowledgeable.  There are a lot of food runners, so the food gets served as it comes out which is a plus, but it doesn&apos;t really make up for the average service and hit or miss food.  This place is extremely expensive.  There are many, many far better restaurants if you are going to pay this kind of money.  The only reason to go to this restaurant is location or to say you went to a celebrity chef&apos;s restaurant.  It&apos;s  far too expensive for what it i</body>

Then the busboy removed plates that should not have been removed...I was NOT finished eating. Staff needs some re-training. Manager came to us and comped our beverages due to too long a wait for waiter.</body>

        <body>Wonderful Omakase menu! The whole table was delighted.  The only disappointment (from me, since I&apos;ve done the experience before) was the conspicuously absent Uni Chawanmushi...   That said, the incredibly creative coconut/mango/foam/poprocks/crazy dessert made up for it. AMAZING.</body>

        <body>Probably one of the best Sushi Bars and or Restaurants I&apos;ve ever dined in. This was my third time there and they are consistently amazing. On this occasion, we decided on the prix fix/tasting  menu. It was art, it was fantastic and i could NEVER do anything like this at home! I&apos;m extremely critical of restaurants as I&apos;ve worked in the business and live in Napa Valley. These guys are a Stone Cold lock!  Only minor issues I have are that the kitchen/ sushi staff is mot engaging and it gets pretty noisy when the restaurant is full.</body>

        <body>If you want to be able to talk to each other ask to be seated on the patio. Otherwise you will have to yell. But very fun place.</body>

        <body>arrived at  7pm was seated immediately. after that all went wrong. the table given to my wife &amp;i   in this very busy restaurant  was very small jammed into a corner wall right next to service station.  my wife was trying to get seated when the glass on the table just fell off and broke. i thought she had bumped the table but this (worst table ive ever sat at) table was rocking back and forth and my silver ware also rolled off as well as my chop sticks 6 times. my wife ordered chicken was happy with it &amp; the ca roll. i  ordered a 64 dollar new york steak and was told that because i wanted it med-well it would take longer. i said ok  asked for some dry sake. the waitress said we have one called #1 so i said ok. it was very good. by this time i had waited 25 minutes for my steak which arrived medium rare in the middle. for me... inedible. i could not believe an expensive place like this not being able to a cook piece of meat in 25 minutes  nor the rude nasty waitress attitude when she ar</body>

        <body>Morimoto was a favorite.  We won&apos;t be back.  While the spicy crab remains a great dish we were underwhelmed by everything else.  Good but not first class.  And our waiter...we&apos;re in wine country, we know what we like, don&apos;t turn your nose up at our choice, a wine on your list.</body>

        <body>Noise level not energetic, just outrageously LOUD. As for the food, you expect a certain level of quality with the Morimoto name. You don&apos;t get it here. The price is much higher than the level of the cooking. Morimoto needs to polish this restaurant.</body>

        <body>This was our first time. The server did a great job of walking us through the menu and giving us suggestions. We had the for tartare and the hamachi tacos to start. Both appetizers were amazing.  For our entree we had the braised black cod and the ishi yaki buri bop. The flavors were terrific in both dishes. The braised black cod was cooked perfectly. The ishi yaki buri bop was fun to watch the server put together and tasted great! We also had to try the sushi. We had a Maki roll, soft shell crab. It was perfect. Of course we saved room for dessert. We tried the s&apos;more and the donuts. The s&apos;more was better than I expected with the smoked chocolate mousse and the donuts were warm and fluffy. This was an overall great experience and would go back again!</body>

        <body>My wife and I have dines all over the world in both resort settings and high-end city restaurants and we have never had a more overall pleasing experience. The sense of arrival was great with staff lined along a wall greeting you, the service level ( James was our waiter) and knowledge of every menu item was impeccable. The cuisine was fresh and flavorful with unique twists being infused from the appetizers to the desserts.  The room was in two sections, both large, high ceilings, and very well decorated and perfectly lit. There is limited outdoor seating but I would consider that for the more casual dining experience as inside is the place to be.  This is a &quot;must dine&quot; experience when visiting Napa. Located downtown on the Napa River with ample parking right across the street from the restaurant. Make reservations for Friday and Saturday nights as they get very busy.</body>

        <body>Love Morimoto! I had only been to the one in HI and had the same expectations of this one. They didn&apos;t disappoint. Everything was delicious from the chicken noodle soup to the sashimi it&apos;s one of my new favorite places.</body>

        <body>I love the young vibe even though it can be too noisy for some (my mother in law), but the service &amp; food will make up for any noise clamor. Best way to initiate into this restaurant is the chefs tasting menu which never fails to please the palate. Good every time must for me is the toro tartar or the tempura prawns. Enjoy!</body>

        <body>I have been to Morimoto twice and both times I was very disappointed. I had the lunch special and the chicken was dry and burned. It was covered in some terrible thick sauce and accompanied by tempura vegetables of celery and jalapenos - yuck. Maybe if other vegetables were included the tempura might have been better. This restaurant is not worth the price. I have had far better sushi in the Bay Area.</body>

        <body>The food was amazing of course! Omakase did not disappoint. The timing of each course was perfect as well. Only down sides were the seating. Two-tops nowadays are just so close to each other that there is no privacy and you&apos;re stuck in the tables conversation that next to you. The service was also lagging quite a bit. Tabke was not fully set (missing chopsticks), server was forgetful about bringing menu, chopsticks. Took sometime to be greeted and order as well (10+ min). The place was not slammed or anything otherwise I wiuld understand being in hospitality myself.</body>

        <body>My father in law is the one who attended this dinner (not I). Yes extremely picky, he&apos;s well traveled, and has eaten at many fine dining establishments. That being said he knows what he likes and will be honest about disliking other things.   He loved Morimoto Napa.   He gave advice: get the wagyu, get at least 4oz, and buy the expensive sake - you won&apos;t regret it. Oh, and bring $600-700 with you. While you can eat cheaper, why would you deprive yourself of some of the best food available? Treat yourself. Its a once or twice in a lifetime experience.   I can&apos;t wait to go!</body>

        <body>Split the Omigase with my wife.  Everything was delicious.  There was plenty for both of us.  The fish was all fresh, well cut and plated with an understanding of how to present each dish.  Pacing was spot on until the last course.  But the restaurant was filled by that time, so allowances can be made.  Each dish came with a good description of what was before us.  Only downside to service (and it is minor) was the filling of water glasses was far to often.  Take a drink of water, have the cup filled, take another drink, cupped filled.  Repeat throughout dinner.  Would highly recommend Morimoto&apos;s Napa.</body>

        <body>AMBIENCE: Guests walk in between the service counter of the kitchen and the wait staff waiting across the hall.  This attempt at something cool was an awkward and misguided first impression as we felt like we were interfering on a busy Saturday night.  The dining room was super loud and you could rub elbows with the people at the next table.  The decor was nice - vineyard branches on the walls - kind of sterile though, and dark.  SERVICE: In a word... deplorable.  Willy Deagle  would cringe at this place.  For starters, the waiter didn&apos;t tell us his name.  He didn&apos;t ask us if we wanted anything to drink or appetizers.  He basically just said, I&apos;m your waiter, what can I get for you?  He asked us if we had any questions about the menu, and when  we looked confused he said he would come back.  So we decided to order just entrees and green tea and get out of there.  The waiter must have realized our bill wouldn&apos;t be $300 or more, so he ignored us the remainder of the night.  My wife orde</body>

        <body>Excellent dinner, with creative seafood (sushi and otherwise), along with creative and delicious desserts.  Highly recommended.  Very noisy but we knew it would be going in and was fine for us.  Some have complained of slow service but our service was great.  Great end to a week of vacation in Napa Valley!</body>

        <body>I had been to Morimoto&apos;s in Waikiki and had a spectacular experience. I took two colleagues to Morimoto&apos;s Napa because one of our party had never had sushi before and we thought we should do it right. Our experience in Napa was fantastic - excellent greeting by the hostess who directed us to the bar (we were early for our reservation); the bartenders took the time to educate us on the drinks though they were clearly busy; we were then escorted to our table and the hostess asked if she could carry our drinks (nice touch!). Our server and his server assistant were great - both gave great advice on what to order. The food was phenomenal!</body>

        <body>We usually go to Morimoto for lunch and it never disappoints. The fish is always fresh and beautifully prepared, whether in soup, salads, sandwiches or sushi rolls. It&apos;s also an easy menu to navigate offering a selection of smaller plates (hot and cold) as well as &quot;lunch sets&quot; that combine several items for a complete meal. My only complaint is with the ramen, it&apos;s not really ramen but more like chicken noodle soup, so I steer clear of it. The miso soup with silken tofu, however, is a definite winner!</body>

        <body>Love! Let me count the ways! We chose Morimotos to celebrate our son&apos;s marriage.  I whispered the occasion to the hostess, she gave us, in our opinion, the best table in the house. They finished the meal with two chocolates with a candle standing to the side.</body>

        <body>We booked on opentable  - we had gone wine tasting and searched for something with seafood and good reviews. We were in Napa on a Monday. Very quiet, slow day. The restaurant was located on a kind of busy street so we parked on the street about a block away. The place was very cool &amp; eclectic. We walked in and was greeted right away by the hostess. We reserved at 2:15pm and they closed at 2:30pm for lunch and reopen at 5pm for dinner. It wasn&apos;t busy at all. We sat in the back. Only a few other tables were occupied. Our server was great. The food was delicious. We were very happy with the food they prepared for our 3 year old since there was no kids menu. Would definitely recommend to friends and family to dine here.</body>

        <body>Sushi is sold by the piece, rather than by the roll. That&apos;s rediculous.  The design of the restaurant is very nice. There seemed to be too many employees.  The drink menu had too many options. The noise level was high.  The music was too loud, a rave/dance constant feel.  The tables seemed narrow and long. I sat across from my wife.  I was closer to the stranger to my left than to my wife sitting across front of me on our anniversary.  The appetizer menu was as abundant as the prices. $39 for an apperiser?  No thank you. Our waiter was annoyed when I didn&apos;t want an appetizer and again when I ordered glasses of the &quot;house white&quot; wine. I ordered the $90 chefs special sushi, which is 20 pieces for my wife and I to share.  The waiter was again annoyed about this.  I suppose he wanted us to order individul meals. He turned to my wife and asked what else she wanted. When she smiled and said nothing, he acted shocked and said &quot;that&apos;s it?&quot; We were there solely for sushi. I understand I was pr</body>

        <body>Tastefully and simply decorated though a bit loud due to the plentiful hard surfaces, Morimoto Napa is an inspiring place to visit.   It brings back memories of my childhood, but at the same time offers all new flavors in finely executed dishes.  Most notable of the dishes we had are the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio,  Braised Octopus, and Braised Black Cod.  All with beautiful presentation and outstanding well balanced flavors.  Portions are adequate and we left completely satisfied, neither wanting more or carrying home a doggy bag.  With the bustle of what seemed to be an endless supply of staff, timing of the food was perfect.  No long wait for the appetizers, and the entrees did not come until we were complete with appetizers (such a miss with many establishments).  Water glasses were never more than half empty and my beer glass was never empty until I found myself finishing the whole Morimoto Black Obi Soba bottle (yes, the whole bottle to myself!).  Wait and bussing staff are friendly, </body>

        <body>My brother, sister in law and I ate there this past Saturday.  Fortunately we had an early reservation because we all had the Omikase (spelling), which is the 8 course tasting menu.  For $120, you get a hot and cold appetizer, sashimi, sushi, a soup course, a seafood and a meat entrée and dessert.  Everything was just delicious.  When you think of 8 courses, you would think it is a lot, but the serving portions were just right.  We were all full at the end, but not stuffed.  I particularly liked the chowder.  it smelled wonderfully and tasted wonderful too.  Our main waiter was fantastic as well as the other servers who brought our food to the table. The kitchen was very accommodating in adjusting some menu items as my sister in law has some food allergies. Definitely coming back.</body>

        <body>Ambiance, and accommodations are nice; exactly what we expected from the Iron Chef.  That&apos;s where it ended.  Service was hurried and mechanical.  Server was efficient, but did not offer any guidance, suggestions or opinions.  Food was underwhelming.  Sashimi was bland despite being served with 5 plastic tubes of seasoned sauces; the server instructed me to use them as an artist uses their palate.  All hype and no substance.  The grilled octopus was much better.  The calamari salad was no better than what you would get at Applebee&apos;s, TGI Friday&apos;s or any other mass consumer chain.  The Sea Urchin pasta featured the pasta and whit sauce, not the sea urchin, which was all but missing.  The &quot;Morimoto  Pork and Applesauce&quot; featured a massive 2 rack chop that was poorly butchered and tough.  The apple/kimchi was a blob of mess next to the pork and tasted like it was poured right out of the jar from the local Asian market.  Two of us enjoyed all this, and a bottle of decent wine for $300.  It</body>

        <body>Beautiful food!  My only negative comment would be the fried food, a bit on the heavy greasy side.  Typically calamari should be light &amp; crisp, not dripping with oil.  But the sashimi is the best we have ever had.</body>

        <body>The restaurant is trendy, so trendy that the whole place is made out of glass and concrete, which only amplifies the very large crowds.  It was deafening and I couldn&apos;t hear my dining companion... at all.  It was impossible to have a conversation.  The food was ok, again very trendy and beautifully presented. My husband had the duck duck goose, which he loved.  We shared the rock shrimp appetizer, which was not as spicy as it sounded like it was going to be (a good thing, IMO).  It was delicious. I ordered the ramen noodles, and that&apos;s ll I got - not a vegetable in the whole giant bowl of soup. I&apos;ve had better Japanese food for a whole lot less money.</body>

        <body>The noise level was downright deafening. Could not hear what servers were saying nor from our friends right across. Ended up with a ringing tone in our heads. Food was excellent. Had the tasting menu with way too much food but totally spoiled by noisy environment. Would&apos;ve given 5 stars if it was quiet.</body>

        <body>We ordered a Whole Fish and when we opened the fish - there was no fish, just skin and a small amount of fish.  The green beans were way over coated and soggy.   Waiter was hard to find.  Servers were great in going over each dish and the other fish dishes we had were great.</body>

        <body>So I bought the living social deal - lunch for 2 fromnliving social $150 for a 6 course meal. Overall the food was pretty good.  Course 1 - Hamachi tartar (left over mashed hamachi and 6 condiments to mix with which include a bean paste?, wasabi, green onion, sour cream, rice balls, and guacamole). -looks fancy but nothing special  Course 2 - beef carpacio -delicious..tender beef, good seasoning, flavoeful  Course 3 - Miso soup w/ manilla clams -Broth was rich and flavorful..a lot better than the typical miso at Japanese restaurants  Course 4 - 4 piece nigiri sushi (hirame, maguro, sake, hamachi) -Not the best but not the worse sushi. Lacking in flavor a bit -- looked &quot;dry&quot; compared to how fresher sushi looks (fat usually glistening)  Mochi palate cleanser - my gf&apos;s was melted and mine was frozen. Minty/herbal flavor...it was interesting  Course 5 - main entree (choice of fish w/ curry sauce or pork chop) -fish had nice texture and curry was nice a light. Dish needed a little more sea</body>

        <body>The restaurant has a nice natural feel inside with wood branches and large windows to see outside. It is best in a day time so you can see out into the valley. The food came out at a good pace to eat and talk. Dining was very nice everything was explained to us as we had the omakase. The food was imaginative, full of fresh flavor much of it fitting for a winter dining experience.</body>

        <body>We went for the first time for my birthday.  We did the Omakase Tasting Menu so that we could get a little bit of everything - it was fantastic!  And our server made a wine suggestion that was right on.  A wonderful way tp celebrate!</body>

        <body>I had high expectations because of the iron chef TV show. Boy I was so wrong. While the services are good, ambiance is comfortable, the food is extremely poorly prepared.  They try to offer fusion Japanese food with creativities and new ideas, but nothing really works. Spicy lobster is so spicy that all you can taste is chilly sauce. Tempura is fried so poorly that you won&apos;t believe it&apos;s from a restaurant at this price level. Chirashi bowl is like grocery store boxed food served in a nice bowl. There are many better options in downtown Napa, don&apos;t waste your money on iron chef hype.</body>

        <body>The food was divine. The service was not. My waiter seemed to think that a single woman for dinner was not worth his time. He was unable to make recommendations from the menu, seemed out out when I asked him what the fish of the day was, was unable to tell me whether the curry was yellow or green or what was the finish or crust was on the halibut, ignored me for the remainder of service and finally handed me the desert menu and walked off. Very disappointed in a restaurant of this caliber.</body>

        <body>Modern-hip setting, concrete flooring and wood all around help amplify an already-loud environment.  Appreciate that tables weren&apos;t packed together (maybe they removed some during a quiet week between xmas/new years or maybe its just good policy?) but I never enjoy being in a dining room where I have to reach across the table and speak loudly just to hear what my companions are saying.  That being said, the food was solid with some unique preparations.  Enjoyed the spare ribs, sushi, surf/turf platter showed they make good beef as well. BYO wine was handled well, and comped even after we were scolded for bringing in a previously-opened bottle that was a leftover from an earlier tasting.  They do have fresh wasabi, but you may have to ask for it.   All-in-all, would return.</body>

        <body>We each had the chef&apos;s omakase menu which included the following -Hamachi signature appetizer with a spatula to enjoy the Hamachi with the different mix-ins and soy sauce -Wagyu beef carpaccio that was the best dish out of the bunch -Clam chowder that was thickened with sushi rice -4 pieces of nigiri (tuna, yellowtail, salmon, and one other) -Miso-soy porkchop with pork belly kimchi OR red snapper with thai curry sauce (the porkchop won this competition) -a dessert parfait with 4 layers - key lime ganache, house-made pop rocks and diced mango, coconut merengue, and mango sorbet  This was excellent, a perfect lunch and beginning to our day in Napa and I will definitely go back here for the omakase menu.</body>

        <body>The waiter ignored us throughout the entire evening, especially as he tried to pick up the diner seated next to us. It took us 15 minutes to get our drink order in, then he still never asked us for appetizer order. We finally got his attention after 35 minutes and placed our  order. The appetizers were very good but are main entre side dishes were cold, like they plated them 15 minutes before placing entre on top. We never did hear the specials of the night, although the diner beside us was told by two different waiters. Other tables around us were also experiencing poor service as we heard everyone complain. No tables ordered dessert because they just wanted to leave as they had already waited entirely too long to be serviced. The final blow was when we had never been offered refills or anything but the diner beside us received a drink on the house. Horrible horrible service!</body>

        <body>My friend and I loved everything about the easter brunch. The mimosas, the desserts, the selection of good food. Especially since my friend had food allergies there was plenty for her to eat!  The ship is a beautiful place and going out on the deck was a great experience.  Whenever you can afford to, this is a great place to eat.</body>

        <body>We dined at the Moshulu for Brunch hoping to be blown away, this was not the case. Although our server Evan was wonderful the food did not match. It was not bad just not over the top. The boat itself is historic but needs some improvement, the carpets are coming undone and wallpaper coming off the walls and a musty smell is present.</body>

        <body>My fiance and I love this restaurant, and we&apos;ve been wanting to try the brunch buffet. It&apos;s generally a pricey restaurant, and brunch was no different ($35/pp) but they had a bottomless mimosa special for $12 that made up for it for us. The food was excellent, our server (Cordell) was excellent, and the drinsk were excellent. We will definitely be back!</body>

        <body>We enjoyed our first dinner at Moshulu! As expected for a 5:45 PM  mid-week reservation, the restaurant was quiet. But by the time we left the tables on the river side of the ship were full and lively. Our entrees were delicious. The prosciutto-wrapped scallops - a special entree that night - were so flavorful. The filet was very good and served on a heaping mound of creamy mashed potatoes. The lobster bisque and crab macaroni and cheese side dish were also very good. The potion wee lathe and we brought some home. The apple pie dessert was a bit disappointing - just a short stack of warm baked apples on a round of pie crust topped with granola. Even though it didn&apos;t quite look like traditional ape pie, it was still very tasty. And let&apos;s not forget the view! Our window overlooked a dock on the river, and we watched several runners out exercising. The river beyond the dock was quiet except for one tug boat that motored by. All in all it was a very enjoyable evening.</body>

        <body>At the Moshulu I had an average dining experience. The Capital Grille in Philadelphia was actually better. There was some kind of wedding party going on upstairs when we were there and the food was a tad bit undercooked so there you have it. Noise and okay food. The ambiance was amazing and the boat and history were really impressive. The food? Not so much. If I had to rate it I would say 6 out of 10. The best part of the evening was the dessert they gave my wife for her birthday. That was better than the food.</body>

        <body>it&apos;s very romantic and a great atmosphere for a quiet dinner. It&apos;s on a ship so it has a lot of special qualities for a special night. I got an Amazon local Groupon deal for $25 to get a  $50 coupon.</body>

        <body>Moshulu is our place to eat for that special occasion. We went on a quiet, cold, early Sunday evening dinner and ended up with having the back room almost to ourselves. Our waitress even surprised us with a special treat for my husband who recently got out of the hospital. This restaurant is one of Philly&apos;s gems, and I recommend it to all my friends. We will be back in the spring to enjoy the deck!</body>

        <body>I called ahead and put in my special request box that I intended to propose to my girlfriend during our visit to Moshulu and the staff was so incredibly receptive! The hosts and our waitress took extraordinary care of us throughout our entire experience. The waitress let us walk around the boat and held our appetizers until we got back to the table. When I finally decided to &quot;Go for it&quot; the waitress was at the ready with the camera even though she was incredibly busy with other tables. Overall, I genuinely appreciated the entire experience and the staff as a whole.</body>

        <body>My wife and I went to Moshulu for our 13th anniversary, and at $200 (after tip), I believe it was the most expensive dinner the two of us had ever eaten.  We got fair value for the price, however.  Our charcuterie plate appetizer was excellent, and we had fun building tiny sandwiches with the various types of meats, cheeses, and vegetables.    My wife&apos;s salmon and my filet mignon were both wonderful, as were our desserts.  Service was fantastic.  Between us, we had 3 drinks (2 &quot;Shipwrecked&quot;s and 1 beer) and as I said, I had the Filet Mignon.  It would be possible to have spent considerably less and still have had a very nice experience at this unique restaurant.</body>

        <body>Perhaps the worst experience at a restaurant I have had. The meal was poorly done, the fish actually made me throw up three times. The decor was also outdated and rather scruffy. The service was fine but ultimately way over-priced for what you get.</body>

        <body>This occasion was my husbands birthday and he&apos;d never been. He loved it ! It was really special and the atmosphere is so very nice. We happened to mention to our waiter is was his birthday while we were toasting and before we left he brought out a special treat with Happy Birthday written on the plate. It was a lovely touch.  The food is excellent, presented well. I think I come for the creme&apos; brulee, which is beyond yummy!  Beautiful setting, delicious food, excellent service !!</body>

        <body>Our evening was filled with great conversation aboard the famous &quot;Tall Ship&quot;. We took two of our dear friends to the Moshulu and had a wonderful  night. The service was professional, the food quite good and the view less impressive. We were facing the parking lot looking through a window that had a significant leak coming from above. Next time I would prefer to sit on the other side.</body>

        <body>I enjoyed celebrating my birthday at Moshulu.  The tall ship is beautiful and makes for an interesting ambiance. The food was very good and the service was attentive. And our drinks were delicious!  I would recommend Moshulu for a romantic dinner or for a special occasion meal.</body>

        <body>We sat by the window and enjoyed the moonlight reflecting on the waterway. The staff were very friendly and attentive, yet they did not hover or take things away too quickly.  The food was brought out in a timely manner, yet not paced so quickly that we couldnt relaxedly enjoy each course.</body>

        <body>This was our second time dining at the Moshulu, as we had a gift voucher. The food was not bad, just not great. The crab cake tasted a bit off. The prices are reasonable, but you do have to pay to park. The service was attentive.</body>

        <body>This is not a cruise ship-or a sightseeing voyage. It&apos;s gourmet dining on an historical relic- a century old  former hard working , 4 masted tall ship.  The food was excellent, the service very good and the atmosphere- priceless.</body>

        <body>I took my wife here for a night out and it was amazing. Great service from our waitress. The food was excellent...my wife had the duck for the first time and I had the swordfish for the first time as well. Both dishes was delicious. Will definitely be back soon and would recommend this restaurant to everybody.</body>

        <body>Had romantic dinner on one of the coldest days in this Philadelphia winter. But the scenic view of the frozen Delaware under the  moon light is actually engaging . I loved the food and service . Also tried a double T wine which was dry but matched our meal perfectly. I recommend table 40 for a secluded dinner for 2 or more.</body>

        <body>Thank you so much for the opportunity to dine with you. Our server was fantastic, kind, and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was presented well, and most notably, looking out onto the water and the Philadelphia lights as we enjoyed a beautiful dinner was a night that won&apos;t be forgotten. Thank you.</body>

        <body>My girlfriend and I went to Moshulu for a Valentine&apos;s dinner on Saturday night. We had a 9pm reservation, arrived about 10 minutes early and were promptly seated. The staff was very pleasant from the get-go. After being seated the waiter assisted us with wine selections which was not long to come out. The food on the menu all sounded remarkable and it was hard to choose what to get. I ordered the rock octopus, lobster bisque, and peking duck. She had the shrimp cocktail, Bibb salad, and filet mignon. The only hiccup of the night was that the second course came out before the first. The staff was very apologetic and seemed genuinely distressed. A higher up came to the table to apologized and asked if we would still like to continue with the first course following the second, we said yes. We were able to laugh it off with our waiter the rest of the night, she was a gem. The food during every course was amazing and came with ample portions.   My only criticisms is that the 1. price was a</body>

        <body>We arrived at the Moshulu a little before six on a January Tuesday night and were a little worried because of the sparse crowd. As it turned out, it was a great opportunity to enjoy a relaxed atmosphere and great food. Besides excellent entrees, we were served the best portion of freshly made humus that we had ever enjoyed anywhere. Great service, too. We assume this place is far busier during the tourist season and in nice weather, so dining here on a quiet winter&apos;s evening was a treat.</body>

The food was great and the staff was VERY professional and gave us a great background story about the ship in which my daughter was asking.   I will be back very soon with just the wife and I as the atmosphere was very nice and intimate.</body>

        <body>We had dinner with a couple friends.  I had the Striped Bass, and it was okay but nothing to write home about.  The fish was fine, but the stuff cooked with it was rather boring.  My Malbec wine with dinner was very good.  And our drinks at the bar before our dinner were very good too.  Hubby and I shared the crème brulee for dessert.  It has bananas in it, which was okay, but we both prefer a plain crème brulee.  Strange that it is also served with a peanut butter cookie, which we told the waiter to hold.  Also, we like our crème brulee served warm, and it was cold.  The pudding part was good, though.  We shared the lobster bisque, which was just okay.  It really could have had more lobster in it.  We&apos;ve definitely had better flavor too; it was a little boring.  Overall, a wonderful place, though,  We will be back again.</body>

        <body>Went for Valentine&apos;s Day dinner.   Fix Price Menu (  Dinner and a bottle of wine for 2 people (over $350)  Atmosphere was very nice. Had a quiet table over looking water.  My wife wanted to order the Filet Mignon for dinner and they would not accommodate her and serve it without the Sautéed Kale with Boursin Cheese.  Ask the waiter if they could serve it without kale and was told no. If you are paying $125/person , they could have easily served it without the Kale. I did have the filet and it was average at best.   Service was average to poor. Waiter had no idea how to service a bottle of wine. When He opened the wine, He immediately poured it and did not allow us to taste it. The wine was going everywhere when he poured it. He also did not tell us about the dancing and dessert bar that they had available on the Deck.  This ship has set sail and is not worth it.</body>

        <body>Amazing food and our waiter was excellent! The food is a bit more on the pricey side though so if you want to eat a lot of good food for cheap, this is def not the place to go. I only came here because I got a good coupon from living social. Otherwise, in would have not been able to afford this dinner. It was delicious, but 40$ for a little piece of salmon..</body>

        <body>I purchased a deal from Living Social for this place and a decided to give it a try. We had GREAT service, and the food was excellent. This place is a little pricey but worth the money.</body>

        <body>My boyfriend had an allergic reaction during desert after asking and being assured there were no nuts or peanuts in the desert. Staff should be more aware of foods that contain nuts even if nuts are not a listed ingredient. Other than that the food was amazing, our server was great and the view was beautiful. We still would recommend this restaurant and return in the future.</body>

        <body>Went to their Sunday brunch this past weekend.  The food was bland and brunch offerings were disappointing.  Red velvet pancakes were hard, like they&apos;ve been sitting out when that item is ordered through the waiter.  We also ordered the eggs benedict and the eggs were extremely runny.  The table across from us sent theirs back because of the egg and the new plate was still runny.  Lobster bisque had no flavor at all.  The shrimp cocktail was good, but you had to peel the shrimp.  So if you don&apos;t mind getting the hands messy, the shrimp cocktail was good.  Service was excellent though.  Our waiter was very responsive and attentive.  We weren&apos;t rushed, through the whole brunch service, so that was good.  Atmosphere was great, however we noticed that there was a leak on one of the windows and we saw that the one table ended up moving because of the leak.</body>

        <body>We dined at the Easter Sunday dinner buffet.  The appetizer, soup, and salad side of the buffet was impressive.  The crab bisque and tuna tartar were excellent, although oddly presented.  The real disappointment was the carved meat area.  We eat about 5 PM, and at one point the were out of all three meats at the carving station.  I waited for about 20 minutes for ham, only be presented with pre-sliced food service ham.   The beef was excellent, but not really worth the wait.  Service was ok.  With a buffet, the best you can expect is to have glasses kept full and have plates cleared quickly.  We didn&apos;t want for drinks, but used plates were left on the table for an extended period of time.  Based on my experience, I probably won&apos;t go back for a holiday.  We might try it for a special occasion, but with all the amazing restaurants in Philadelphia, we won&apos;t be returning any time soon.</body>

        <body>I heard good things about this restaurant so my wife and I dined for our anniversary. It was raining, snowing, and sleeting so the scenic properties were a little daunting but on a Good day eating with a view of the water would be perfect. The service was Great. Our Server Rob was very articulate and knowledgeable and not to mention Polite. He made us feel special on a night that was special for us, how appropriate. The food was Excellent tuna Tartar, Peking duck and crab cakes WoW, they even gave us a treat compliments of the House. I had a beer from a local brewery and the wife had a shipwreck cocktail perfect, I mean perfect recommendation by Rob. What more can I day we enjoyed our selves. The only set back was the parking even though it&apos;s on site it still cost $15.00? Other then that perfect 10.</body>

        <body>Overall this place is a one time thing. I ordered I soecific bourbon on the menu and the server assumed I would not know the difference which I did. Then tells me we are out of said bourbon. For the price of their drinks you expect to taste SOME alcohol. Wine list was very subpar charging $40 for a $6 bottle of wine is highway robbery. Server spoke broken English so it was hard to understand. Apps were ok oysters did not taste right but that&apos;s the nature when ordering that. Lobster bisque and very little lobster mainly all bisque. Main entree was very good , I ordered the swordfish, the horseradish/ asparagus creme very good. But for the price of $300 for everything I feel it is not worth it to ever return. Maybe because it was Valentine&apos;s Day which I understand the limited menu but not the serving sizes and drinks lack of flavor, got the bourbon hound tasted nothing but grapefruit juice.</body>

        <body>I proposed to my [now] wife at the Moshulu. So, for us, this place is close to our hearts. God forbid the night of the proposal something had come wrong, perhaps poor service or less than great food, than perhaps it wouldn&apos;t be so dear. Thank God it was the opposite of that! Our first experience was fantastic! ...So great that we made sure to revisit on our honeymoon, and again, on my wife&apos;s birthday (which was our last and most recent visit). This place is great for special occasions. Not just because of the atmosphere, but because they take care of you. There&apos;s always a complimentary treat at the end of your evening and they provide it to you with care. Speaking of care, the food is amazing because the chef gives a hoot. It really tastes like he cooks from the heart. That might sound strange to some, but once you&apos;ve had food that was joyously made, you&apos;ll know exactly what I am referencing. Also, something very important to my wife and I, service. Great service is a necessity when d</body>

        <body>We had a wonderful time aboard the historic Moshulu. We were there to celebrate our daughters engagement, and we were blown away with kindness and thoughtful hospitality. Our server recognized our celebration, and before we could ask for anything we were brought a complimentary champagne toast. The food was delicious. At the end of our meal they brought out a dessert with &quot;Congratulations&quot; written in chocolate. Well played Moshulu!!! The only negative is there is a fee of $15 to park.</body>

        <body>I was looking for a nice place to take my wife after ice skating at the River Rink. I got exactly what I wanted. Service was great at the bar and during dinner. Food was decent. It was interesting being on a old ship like that. Our table was next to a window so we spent some time looking at the icy river.  Overall it was a really nice night.</body>

        <body>I took my wife here for her birthday... which also happened to be Easter Sunday. They were serving a buffet-style brunch all day, and although I was hesitant about that, DoO Michael convinced me to come on in anyway, when I called to make reservations.  It was a beautiful day and for the most part, the main attraction was the boat and the water. The cocktails were tasty, the wine list fairly solid and the brunch menu a few notches above what you&apos;d normally get at a buffet.  The server was fantastic and even had it noted that I called and was hesitant about the buffet. He made some suggestions to keep us happy. We ordered a nice bottle of Franciacorta from the cellar and it was perfect with our food. I&apos;d say, the carving stations were the best part of the buffet, the filet was superb, and the desserts were a real standout on the menu.  This is probably not an accurate assessment, since we didn&apos;t really get to try the regular menu. But in general, our experience was a cut above with the</body>

        <body>Went to Moshulu with my husband and family-- the atmosphere was certainly very special and nostalgic-- it definitely felt different than most of the trendy restaurants around.  Both the service and food were outstanding!  The swordfish was sublime!  A very memorable occasion indeed!</body>

        <body>The atmosphere was quiet (the pleasant kind not the awkward kind) and romantic. The food was good, I ate every bite. However, I ordered the filet mignon medium rare and got it with absolutely no pink at all. It&apos;s filet mignon, so it was still yummy, but it should not have been served that way, especially when requested much more rare. It wasn&apos;t a big deal, but for $44 I expect to get what I ordered, not be left wondering how it will come out. The service overall was very professional, except that we were not asked once how our meals were (Although to be fair she did ask about the appetizer). Again, we ate every bite so I&apos;m sure she inferred that we enjoyed it but I still appreciate a check in a few bites in, especially with such an otherwise professional  restraurant.  Overall I would maybe go back for a very special occasion but would be more vocal next time if I experienced the same discrepancy between my order and my meal.</body>

        <body>We have dined at Moshulu quite a few times. It is pricey but the food well worth it. On our last visit, Friday, 2/13 it would have been beneficial to be made aware of the fact that it was a prix fix menu only due to the Valentine&apos;s Day weekend. If not while making the res on Open Table then at the time the restaurant called to verify our res. I am not a desert eater and usually only have an appetizer and an entrée. 4 course dinner for $100 per person was a waste and totally over priced.  We will steer clear of the Moshulu for some time until the pain of a total of $ 310.00 (including parking, 1 cocktail, 2 house chardonnays and tip) has eased up!</body>

It was my boyfriend and I&apos;s anniversary, and the waitress made sure to write us a happy anniversary note on the plate with our dessert. I would highly recommend this restaurant!</body>

        <body>The first disappointment was the hefty $15 parking fee. Then we get out of the car into a dark non shoveled or de iced parking lot and had to walk on ice and slush down three steps holding on for dear life. I wanted to turn around and leave but my guest said lets just continue on. The walk way was not salted and very slippery. I was upset and told the hostess as soon as we arrived about the conditions outside and she laughed.  That was not a good start to the evening.   As stated above the view was nice, the atmosphere inside was quiet and comfortable. The food was very good but the service was slow and they forgot our vegetable side which cost us an extra $10. The waitress brought it after I finished my meal. That did not make me happy.  There were about five tables of  two to three patrons and it was an icy/snowy night no excuse for slow/poor service.   Overall I feel our dining experience was pleasant due to the food but I probably would not go back any time soon. There are a lot o</body>

        <body>Last Saturday came to Mushulu with my fience  before he left the country. I brought some flowers, candles and a present to my boyfriend that I gave to the restaurant when we arrive and they organized for me on the table. So, it is a lot that they did this work with a big smile and so fast, also we didnt have to wait more than 5 min for our table. Food was really good, a lot of options for breakfasta and lunch, and the option to pay 12 dollars for unlimited drinks.   I definitely recommend this place, is romantic , excellent custumer service and good food.</body>

        <body>We went for the Sunday Brunch which, in the past, has been outstanding.  Past experience was good atmosphere, super food and lots to choose from.  Our recent visit was very disappointing.  Upon arriving (and having made a reservation) we were told to take a seat and they would be right with us.  We waited almost 15 min before being seated and that was only after we mentioned to the hostess that we were waiting to be seated.  Her response was, I&apos;ll be right with you.  It wasn&apos;t as if it was crowded as there were very few people in the dining area.  We were finally seated.  Our waiter was very friendly and came right over for our drinks.    The buffet was very disappointing.  The main table was half empty.  Very few items to choose from and the omelet station was no longer there.  We were told that if you wanted an omelet, it had to be ordered from the kitchen, which took about 15 min.  I will not be recommending this buffet to anyone in the future.  Sorry, it used to be a &quot;great&quot;  buff</body>

        <body>Wow! We had an unforgettable dinner, celebrating our kids&apos; 14th birthday. Over the years, we have traveled every year and we dine out at a nice restaurant about once a month. The result: We have turned our kids into teen aged foodies! They were thrilled when we surprised them with a family dinner aboard the Moshulu. Our waiter, Vince, was right there with a warm welcome and a birthday card.  He engaged each of our kids, making them feel &quot;grown up&quot; and sophisticated. The food was uniquely prepared and presented, and everything was delicious. We all enjoyed the lobster bisque, and the kids had octopus, tuna sushi rolls, calamari, and shrimp. My wife and I enjoyed the squash soup, swordfish and duck. It ended with deserts and candles, and Happy Birthday! written in chocolate. (Thankfully, they don&apos;t do a tacky birthday song sung by the staff)   We learned all about the ship from Vince and we took a walk on deck and enjoyed the view, even though the weather was misty and rainy.

        <body>Came here back in November to celebrate our anniversary and had a fabulous dinner with superior service. Came back again to meet our daughter in college for a nice dinner. Food was great...once we eventually got it! Our server Lark was inattentive, almost as if avoiding us after it took over 20 minutes to be served our salad course. When I asked her why it took so long to get salads she said she had no idea! When our entrees were eventually served, she never came back to check on us until everything was cleared. Three tables around us who had a different server were in and out before we got our entrees. If nothing else some explanation for the delay would have been appreciated...a had a 2 hour dining experience, and not by choice.</body>

        <body>My husband and I had not been out to dinner without children in quite some time. We decided to try Moshulu. We had an amazing dinner and the ambience and service as impeccable! Emily was our server and would ask to have her again. We will definitely return and try the brunch.</body>

        <body>Expensive prices for decent food-- nothing too innovative or unique. My boyfriend ordered the salmon dish, it was nice but not flavorful. I had a sushi roll which was huge and the Caesar salad, both were good. Ambiance was nice, felt like we were on a cruise ship. However, we were seated on the dock side of the boat so the view was of a parking lot rather than the water.</body>

        <body>My wife and I have gone to Moshulu every year for 4 years to relive our first date and we both said this will be our last trip.  We always loved this restaurant but something has happened and they have changed their menu to a point where we could not even pick an appetizer that we would like.  This was never a problem in the past.    The menu seems to have a new focus and the filet is over priced and had very little flavor.  The onion rings that were served on top of my filet were the best part of my meal.  My wife had salmon and she did not like the taste and it was under cooked.  We decided to order the truffle fries and they never arrived.  So sad.  This was a very disappointing experience.  Take my advice go to the Chart house next door.  There you don&apos;t have to pay $11 to park and add the additional expense of overpriced and under taste food.</body>

        <body>I was drawn to this restaurant because of the views.   Initially the host seated us on the side of the boat facing the parking lot.  I requested to be seated on the other side of the boat facing the waterside and was accomodated without hesitation.  The menu was great and I enjoyed every bit of my meal!</body>

        <body>Although the service was excellent, it is unlikely I will return to this restaurant.  They were out of several items on the menu; therefore, choices were limited.  The $15 parking fee was excessive.</body>

        <body>Good fresh good served graciously. That&apos;s what they do.  Offering a contemporary American menu of casual dishes, crafted to work with the seasons, in a warm and stylish setting. They say our name is an understatement, but it&apos;s still good. The views are great no matter where they sit you and you can be under-the-radar, go-to, neighborhood foodie hangout and enjoy the atmosphere for hours. I will recommend this to many friends.</body>

        <body>The Moshulu is such a romantic place to dine. Once again we enjoyed ourselves. We did have to send a drink back, maybe a new bartender? The service was professional and full of suggestions. There was a smell that did not go away(hard to enjoy our food). We will try again, maybe its just an old ship thing.</body>

        <body>I have been to the Moshulu four times since 2011. The staff is friendly and attentive and the ship is beautiful with a romantic ambiance.  Every dish I&apos;ve ordered has been at minimum delicious, if not mouthwatering. My favorite dish is their scallops - I order it EVERY time - which are soft, flavorful and melt in your mouth. Also noteworthy are their crabcakes.  To make this spot even more attractive, two of the four times I&apos;ve been there I&apos;ve used &quot;online deals&quot; that they offer from various discount websites.  The only reason I gave ambiance 4 stars was because during my most recent visit , we were seated in a corner booth which was dimly lit, making it difficult to read the menu and look at one another.</body>

        <body>I have been there for several Sunday brunches with 7+ guests and all my guests have loved it except the &apos;VOLUME&apos; of the piano. To be honest, if that does not change, I will stop taking guests there.  And one more comment, the shrimp was not pealed the last 4 weekends. They were left with shells. Two of my guests said, &quot;Oh, that is too much trouble for a good restaurant&quot;.  You are wonderful but you have to deal with these two issues.</body>

        <body>Part of the overall dining experience includes the sense of smell. When we first walked into the reception area there was a musty  mildew  smell... It was all over the reception room.  Then as they walked us back to the table all I could smell was fish.  I ordered the filet - which was tasted good.the service was slow and they messed up our bill at the end. What is unique is you dine in a boat setting - visually it was nice.</body>

        <body>I surprised my husband with a reservation to Moshulu for his birthday. The staff was attentive, the food was amazing. We knew it would be a little more expensive than our usual places but the portions were more than enough for the cost. Everything was delicious. The crab Mac and cheese was my favorite and the raspberry peach Cosmo was great too. They gave my husband a complimentary glass of champagne and a small dessert for his birthday. Johnny was our waiter and he was so knowledgeable and pleasant. Absolutely wonderful experience.</body>

        <body>I picked the Moshulu for a quiet little girls night out and I definitely made the right choice! Drinks made by the bartender Josiah were perfect. The food was seriously out of this world and to have such an awesome server like the one we had, Andrew, made the already delicious food taste even better!  It was a memorable girls night thanks to the Moshulu. We&apos;ll definitely be back!</body>

        <body>We had a wonderful meal, with impeccable service. They thought of everything, we received a card for our anniversary, a champagne toast, and a classy dessert plate with &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot; written in chocolate. Only bad thing is you have to pay to park.</body>

        <body>The striped bass comes with a not-so-compatible amalgam of supporting garnishes that tasted like the ingredients were just whatever was on hand. It wasn&apos;t, since the ingredients are listed on the menu. The flavors did not work at all together, at least for my palate, nor that of my date.  The cheesecake for dessert sounded unbelievable on the menu, but was just average upon consumption.  I can&apos;t speak to the quality of any other dish.</body>

        <body>Let me start by saying the meal and experience wasn&apos;t horrible, but it just wasn&apos;t for me.  I thought the outside looked dated and unkept.  When&apos;s we entered the restaurant it had a musty smell and the low ceilings made it feel tight.  The decor was very dark and dated.  I just had an eerie feeling the whole time.  I also felt like the restaurant was on a slant.  We were sat at a booth overlooking the water, but also another couple which was awkward.  Our server was great and the food was very good.  I did think it was a bit overpriced and was a little shocked our bill was almost $300 for 4 people.  It was very quiet throughout the restaurant which I also found unusual.  I don&apos;t see myself going back.</body>

        <body>What else is there to say for its scenic view? The restaurant is a ship! The service was great even though it took a while to get seated because there was no hostess. It is a great restaurant for lunch and dinner! The service was great and the food was spectacular. The sushi can be a little salty, but other than that, it was a great experience.</body>

        <body>How much better can brunch get!? I have always been a fan of The Moshulu and finally experienced the Sunday Brunch and was NOT disappointed! It had just the perfect mix of elegance, class and style with the Jazz Pianist providing excellent dining music. The selection was great. The blueberry mascarpone French Toast was out of this world!  We can&apos;t wait for our Wedding Ceremony on The Moshulu on 5-1-15!!!</body>

        <body>We arrived for reservation at 6:30 to find a very subdued atmosphere, very few diners which we&apos;ve found not a good sign. Music playing was something obsure out of the 40&apos;S?  Had a nice table by the waterside. Were disappointed in limited menu with no specials. We orderd the swordfisn and wedge salad ( which we shared), 1 glass of wine and creme brulee to share and bill was $77.  We don&apos;t mind paying for a great meal, but this was very overpriced for what we had! The swordfish was bland with some sauce, creme brulee was ruined with a layer of bananas on top....tasted like banana pudding for $10! The waiter, Andrew, was very attentive and we give him 5 stars...hopefully he&apos;ll find a better restaurant to work in!</body>

        <body>I took 2 colleagues from other cities for dinner.  Surroundings and food were great.  Service needs some attention.  Request for fresh lime slices went unheeded twice.  We had a nice leisurely dinner, and peaceful surroundings to discuss business.</body>

        <body>We were a party of 4 and had been to the Moshulu on the previous NYE. We had a wonderful experience and decided to repeat our visit. Perhaps last year we were just lucky; dinner went off without a hitch. I am not sure why, but, this year things did not run smoothly at all. After we were seated ( bar wait first of 20 minutes, not unreasonable), we waited 15 minutes before we were approached by anyone. At that time we ordered another beverage, and before the beverage arrived, we ordered dinner. Our appetizer arrived and we still had not received our beverage.  The rest of the evening progressed in the same manner. I would return to Moshulu, but never for a special night . They just did not have their act together!</body>

        <body>My husband and i visited this restaurant on our date night and because we were able to get a groupon. If you&apos;re looking for something different thats by the water and close to attractions in Philly its worth considering. The food was good, but very pricey for portion size and quality. I&apos;ve had food just as good at other restaurants but half the price.   I believe the prices are to match the atmosphere, but honestly the boat needs some work and it looks much better on the outside than inside.   I can see this place being a better overall dining experience during the warm months, where you can really enjoy the outdoors. I would probably consider coming back but not somewhere i&apos;d frequent often   I had the crabcake and he had the steak.</body>

        <body>Went for the Sunday brunch buffet with 5 friends. Food was very good, but was served lukewarm and was a tad over priced. The staff was excellent and the live piano playing makes for a very pleasant atmosphere.  Best bet in the city, but if you&apos;re not already in the city, there&apos;s many country clubs which offer a comparable selection for $30 less a person.   Over all for the price of what you pay, you better enjoy the views and the history of the ship. If not, you will may leave feeling disappointed.</body>

        <body>Love this place.  Great for friends to chill with a nice meal and great view.  Good is good. Menu needs updating. No Moscoto.  Potion control sized. Hummus and crab cake delicious.  I have been here 3 times it has never been crowded when I came.  Try to go during the week or Saturday afternoon.</body>

        <body>My first immediate turn off was paying $15.00 for parking in their lot to eat dinner.  I am not use to an establishment charging me to eat at their restaurant.  I said I will never eat here again before I even entered the restaurant.  The food was so good I might reconsider but it will be awhile  The food was outstanding!  However it took a very long time to get a drink from the bar.  We were there at 5:30 relatively empty but the bar staff was really, really slow; unless it was our waiter not picking up the drinks when they  were ready.  He was always thanking us for our patience.  We were not rushed so it would be a good place for a leisurely dinner</body>

        <body>After spending all day in the city we decided to have diner at the Moshulu.....and so glad we did!!! The gentlemen at the bar started us off on such a happy note that we almost stayed at the bar for dinner. The food did not disappoint nor did the service. Our server Lark was outstanding, one of the best servers I have ever had. Kudos to the Management!!!!</body>

        <body>I was expecting the food to better tasting and the portion a larger for the price.  The salmon I ordered was sort of mushy and a bit salty on the outside.  The portions were also small for the price.  However, the dessert was out of this world, unfortunately, also not enough, too small.   The coffe was fresh and very good.  We wanted to sit by a window but instead were seated in a room that was a bit dark with not much of a view.  When I made the reservations I was not asked if I wanted a table with a view so I was disappointed when we were told there was nothing available by the river side.  I want to mention, however, that the service was excellent.</body>

        <body>Dining aboard a ship gives a special flavor to the evening. Quite good food but the chef does try too hard to be distinctive. Simplicity is often best with fine ingredients. Portions a bit excessive. But overall, a fine birthday dinner for my wife.</body>

        <body>Great food. We started with the calamari &amp; artichoke hearts and then had the chicken breast &amp; scallops as our main dishes. Any of those dishes would bring us back. Service was good. They were out of literally several different wines so the options were few. My complaint is the parking. $15 is too much if I&apos;m paying for dinner at your establishment also. I would easily pay $5 or even $10, but $15 is ridiculous. Don&apos;t go here if you&apos;re going for a view, but if you want good  food this chef won&apos;t disappoint.</body>

        <body>I havent been to Moshulu in 30 years and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food, service and atmosphere!  My dining companions had never been there and as college students were completely enchanted by the fact of dining on a boat!  We were permitted to go up top after eating and had a blast pretending to be on the Titanic with Kate and Leo!  Highly recommend!</body>

        <body>Great food but as I said, the Valentine&apos;s fixed menu and more importantly the prices were astronomical. 2 people with that menu and 2 alcoholic drinks came to almost $400 after tax/tip.  I expected to pay more considering the day but this was ridiculous. Ashame we didn&apos;t know ahead of time, we would have never went there.  There were a LOT of open tables, now I know why.  Always check their website or caLl first to check if they are doing a price gouge night for a holiday.  No clue what market the owner thinks he&apos;s in.  This isn&apos;t New York.</body>

        <body>We really had a wonderful time dining aboard the historic Moshulu. Andrew was our server, he was very knowledgeable with the history and the food. He offered to take us on a tour as well. Someone should grant Andrew a raise!</body>

        <body>We arrived around 6:40 and were seated within  5 minutes.  It was pretty empty at that time but it filled up very quickly.  I ordered a Victory Dirtwolf and my girl ordered a Lemonade with Jameson (St. James Lemonade, I think) Both drinks were delicious.  The server brought us a small complementary hummus and crackers which was pretty good, then he brought us bread and butter which the butter was excellent (honey and sea salt butter).  I ordered the Lobster Bisque and Surf and Turf and she ordered crab mac and cheese and the crab cakes.  The lobster bisque was creamy and delicious with just the right amount of lobster and her crab mac and cheese was very good.  The Ribeye was the best I have ever had. I highly recommend it.  Her crab cakes were decent but nowhere near as good as my steak. Overall, I give 4 stars only because of the price.  We had a coupon from living social ($25 off)  and our bill was still close to $165.  I realize it would be about $50 less if we didn&apos;t drink but oh</body>

        <body>The setting is fantastic. Mosulu creates a dining experience rivaled by few. Go at sunset or later to maximize the fat astir views from your table. The food sadly is often over seasoned and poorly balanced. While the lobster bisque tasted strongly of lobster, it tasted too strongly of lobster.  The swordfish dish was so strongly seasoned with bacon and bleu cheese that I really couldn&apos;t taste the fish, which should have been the star of the dish. Great place for any occasion where you need the setting to shine but for a hardcore foodie I&apos;d skip it.</body>

        <body>Wonderful experience second time at this restaurant.  Didn&apos;t realize the day before Valentine&apos;s was a &quot;holiday&quot; so my coupon from Living Social was not accepted, but the food experience well outweighed a savings of a few dollars.</body>

        <body>I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary and the staff were very accommodating. I requested to be seated with an ocean view and they fulfilled that request. My boyfriend had the prosciutto wrapped sea scallops which was a little bit salty for both of our taste but other than that he enjoyed his dish. I had the crispy skin atlantic salmon which tasted amazing. The atmosphere is very romantic and after our dinner we were able to go upstairs on the deck. The view is amazing, you can see the bridge and they decorated the sails with lights. I would highly recommend Moshulu for any romantic/special occasion.</body>

        <body>I had an amazing experience. The menu was reasonably priced, especially for the quality of the food offered. The steaks were from Nature Source, which means they care about the minute details and characteristics of how to make a delicious steak. Along with these strong, natural ingredients, the style of the dishes were very aesthetically pleasing, while at the same time perfect combinations of various flavors, all that complimented one another.  The customer service was not of this planet. We were treated as if the waiter was our friend, and he even took the liberty  to educate us on the history of specific dishes, details on how wine is made, and a ton of friendly stories that enhanced my dining experience. If anyone from management is reading  this, William (my waiter) needs a promotion!</body>

        <body>My family and I enjoyed a very nice dinner for our daughter&apos;s 18th birthday.  The atmosphere was warm, cozy, and friendly.  The waiters were very polite and energetic.  A few of our family members would like to make this their wedding venue.  It is a very nice restaurant for a family event or for a quaint romantic evening.</body>

        <body>I have driven by Moshulu many times, but Saturday was my first time dining there. I&apos;d like to start by saying the cuisine was fantastic, and the wait staff was very attentive. It was more expensive than I thought it was going to be, however the food is worth the price. That being said, the interior needs a bit of updating. When you first walk into the establishment it&apos;s quite dark. I&apos;ve heard of mood lighting, but this is a little much. The decor is almost random, and very 80&apos;s-90&apos;s. I would recommend this restaurant to a friend, but strictly for the cuisine, not the ambiance.</body>

        <body>I had personally been to OYA restaurant once, a few years ago for my birthday. My mom&apos;s birthday was coming up and I had been wanting to take her to OYA restaurant ever since my first experience at OYA and this was the perfect opportunity. I made my reservation online and made sure to mention in the notes that the reason for the visit would be due to the fact that it was my mom&apos;s birthday on that date. I called a few hours before my reservation to confirm and I was told my reservation was confirmed, I put in one extra request via phone and asked if we could please be seated by the fireplace. Although the person on the phone told me they didn&apos;t guarantee tables, they would input the note in my reservation. Once we got into the restaurant we were seated at our table and it turns out that not only was this table by the fireplace which I had asked for..it was also the same table I got for my birthday the first time at OYA! The atmosphere was perfect, the server (I forgot his name, but a M</body>

        <body>This is my second time visiting Oya and while I enjoyed it more my first visit I still had a nice dinner.  There were a lot of parties and events going on...a sweet 16, another person celebrating a birthday, I noticed a bachelorette dinner celebration etc...this is a great spot for large group celebrations.  I enjoyed my Sea bass, however the Mac &amp; Cheese wasn&apos;t what I was expecting...not my favorite side dish.  The service here is always great!</body>

        <body>Great experience! Our waiter Daniel was considerate, attentive, and overall awesome. We were provided extra shots/champagne throughout the meal. I had my 24th Birthday dinner here with my friends. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking to take a bigger party out. Food was also delicious, would recommend the sushi in general.</body>

My guest and I are mostly vegetarian and the menu met our needs perfectly...lots of offerings with variation in style and taste.   Will definitely return.  Some reviews said that it was too loud...that was not our experience.   Lively yes, overbearing, absolutely not.</body>

        <body>It was too loud.  The server (who had an English accent) was very welcoming.  I wish I remember their names. The food was good.  It&apos;s just hard to enjoy with so much noise. The only way I would return to this restaurant is for the great service I received with that server or for the great service I normally get at the bar.</body>

        <body>My friend and I went here for restaurant week and could not have had a better experience.  The food was unbelievable from start to finish, the drinks were strong and delicious, and the service was the best in town.  Anything we wanted or needed was anticipated by the staff like ninjas.  The food came out with perfect timing and everything was made to perfection.  It&apos;s not often that I dine out without a single constructive criticism but I can honestly say that I could not have asked for anything better than this experience.  Daniel (?) our server was kind, helpful, and attentive.  I ordered the tuna tartar, skirt steak, bread pudding, naked moonshine, and the apple pie shine.  My friend ordered the tomato soup, skirt steak, chocolate cake, and the same cocktails.  Everything got a 10 across the board.  Only note of mention is that the naked moonshine will be too strong tasting for the occasional drinker so proceed with caution... of course we loved it though.  Thanks for an amazing ex</body>

        <body>Went for a special occasion with husband after having already been to OYA twice before. Male waiter took our drink order and it never came. Female waiter took drink order and it arrived. Female waiter took appetizer order and when make waiter came to take entree order we explained what we had already ordered for apps. He said this was no problem. 25 minutes later our entrees arrived. We never got our apps. Female waiter never apologized and make waiter never even offered to take anything off the meal or comp. we then waited ten minutes in the cold for our valet car. Good is great. Service needs serious adjustment.</body>

        <body>Hip, trendy Asian restaurant located a block from Verizon Center. Variety of settings include a large nook in front, long hightop ledge along the bar perimeter, large cozy seating area next to the bar, seating at the bar, and of course an ample dining area. House music but not intrusive. Great service, excellent food, reasonable prices for this quality, especially in downtown DC.</body>

        <body>My friend and I were treated extremely well.  Drinks are fun and creative. Our sushi was amazing: Rainbow roll and Spicy Scallop roll.  Entrees were cooked well and presentation was lovely, however we&apos;re blown away with the salmon or asparagus ravioli dishes.  Dessert was adorable-- had two mini birthday cakes.  We loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well!</body>

        <body>We were greeted warmly as returning customers and seated right in front of the fireplace on a frigid night (yay!) by Chris, whom I believe is the manager.  Then our waiter, Daniel, shared his knowledge and recommendations and we had terrific cocktails (customized to our liking), sushi and entrees (mussels, salmon and ribeye--all fabulous!).  We finished off with one of the best cups of brewed coffee and their delectable carrot cake and a sorbet trio.  The attention to service was exceptional--the entire staff was stealthy in their movements and never missed a beat or interrupted our dinner conversation; the overall experience was so incredible that I will continue to introduce my friends and work colleagues to Oya in 2015.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT---and right near Gallery Place metro stop for convenience.</body>

The seven-pepper tuna roll was equally good.  The lunch special for $25 is a steal for this quality.  Service is impeccable.</body>

        <body>I mean it.  If you haven&apos;t eaten here, do so.  We had apps, sushi and an entree and everything was simply wonderful.  The server, Angelina, was really great and the manager, Hakim, came over to chat.  The hostess was equally nice.  Many restaurants have great food but have staff that are distant or non-interactive.  Great food and a staff who made the evening all the more enjoyable.</body>

        <body>Oya&apos;s food was up to par considering the range of trendy restaurants in the area competing for the same clientele. Service felt rushed from the moment we sat and throughout each course, granted I understand it is restaurant week and having worked in the industry a while back, I understand you want to move two tops very quickly - however don&apos;t be so &quot;obvious&quot;. I believe at the end of the night I had lost my voice just trying to have a normal conversation. Decor is spot on from the entrance to the fireplace backdrop behind the bar as it welcomes you into their lounge area. However, the dining room is extremely loud. You cannot hold a regular conversation with the person across from you unless you shout.</body>

        <body>I&apos;m glad I stumbled upon this establishment on opentable.  Like many reviews have stated, the decor is outstanding and the fire place really adds a romantic touch.  Our server, Alexis was very friendly and highly recommended the Chilean Sea Bass and the NY Strip.  In the end, we were given a small velvet cake in honor of our special occasion.  I will definitely return!</body>

        <body>My wife located this restaurant with her keen online search &amp; noticed the genuinely positive reviews. We attended with some friends to celebrate my birthday. None of us had been to Oya prior to this weekend, but we all said we will definitely be returning! The ambiance is outstanding and the food was incredible. The service went above and beyond our expectations. Many times attending dining in the District we have noticed the service to have a prideful undertone with a snobby appeal. Not at Oya! The hostess was very humble as well as the server and management. These guys know how to make you feel special and this makes the food &amp; ambiance seem just that much better. If you want to enjoy great food while being treated as fine as the dining please make this your destination and you won&apos;t be disappointed!!</body>

        <body>What a pleasant surprise. I chose this place because it was close to my hotel. Excellent, attentive service, outstandingly high quality and creative food, meh sake choices, but great desserts. The menu was so great, it was truly hard to choose. It&apos;s great for sushi lovers and non-Japanese food eaters.  I stuck with sushi and was not disappointed. Very high quality fish and bold favors. I have to call out the service as outstanding again; it was that timely, personable, attentive and accurate.</body>

        <body>Charlie was our waiter &amp; everything was impeccable!  It just so happened to be restaurant week so the meal was incredibly well-priced and delicious.  I had a group of 7 of us for my birthday dinner and we were seated at a round table (I had originally wanted one of their booths, but the round table ended up being way better).  It was beautiful, service was exquisitely coordinated, and we were constantly being attended to and checked on.  I had the Risotto, which was heaven.  Everything else was delicious and my guests had an amazing time as well.  At the end, they brought in complementary mini red velvet cakes and plates decorated with &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; for me and the other birthday girl.  Charlie helped us light the mini cupcake sparklers I brought with me (for added flare) and even helped us take group photos at the end of the dinner.  All in all, an amazing, gorgeous, classy place for any date or upscale celebration.  I will definitely be finding an excuse to go again.</body>

        <body>Ever heard you get what you pay for?  Well, it&apos;s true at this spot.  You pay a pretty penny for great service and it is great service you receive at Oya.  I took my husband for our anniversary and if the ambience doesn&apos;t win you over (white leather, fireplace, waterfall), then the food and drinks will.   He is still raving over the sushi and I couldn&apos;t be happier with the service we received.   From the host, to the server, to the busboys, everyone was absolutely delightful.    Worth every penny (dollar).</body>

        <body>This was my second visit here and I doubt I&apos;ll be back.  Food was fine but overpriced. I love a nice meal out but there&apos;s much better food and service all over DC, and within blocks of this place.  Though the ambience is lovely the place was packed, to the point where my chair was kicked about every 5 minutes despite sitting as close to my table as possible.  Service was inconsistent.  Our waiter was smug and repeatedly interrupted our conversation. However, the servers and the gentlemen who refilled our water and cleared out table were efficient.  The highlight of the meal was my entree, the chef&apos;s selection sashimi.  Wine was good too, with a thorough selection.  But this place is far from special and I can&apos;t think of a reason as to why I&apos;d be back.</body>

        <body>If you are looking for a Hot spot to take a date out in DC, without reservation, Oya would be the first place I would recommend.  I have a very high standard when it comes to dining experiences and Oya was the first place in a long time to meet those expectations.  Once I entered in the door I was greeted by a professional staff which also offered to take my date and myself coats. Once seated, the evening became very romantic the open candles on each table, dim lighting to set the mood, also sitting by the rose wall with waterfall. My date was very impressed. Then, once the food came out I had died and went to heaven. I WILL STRONGLY recommended Oya. It will be on my top favorite list of restaurants that i have been to around the world.</body>

        <body>We went to Oya specifically to try the sushi and drink some wine.  We were not disappointed on either count.  The nigiri sushi/sashimi choices are much more limited than you would find at a traditional Japanese sushi restaurant.  This made sense because this place is much more modern , and offers a number of other appetizers and main courses along with specialty cocktails.  The sushi/sashimi that was offered, however, was very good.  The cuts of maguro, sake, hamachi and unagi were of good size and quality, and as nigiri, well proportioned to the rice.  We tried four rolls besides and every one was very tasty, with wonderful ingredient combinations.  We couldn&apos;t resist and also tried an octopus appetizer.  As good as that was, we enjoyed the maki sushi more.  The wine list was very approachable, with a number of delicious wines at reasonable price points.  We enjoyed Virginia viognier and Willamette Valley pinot noir.  Both excellent.   We will be going back to Oya.</body>

        <body>I attended during restaurant week and thought that menu was unnecessarily altered from the regular menu (e.g. you could get the burger, but it came with different toppings and no bacon). The appetizers we ordered were the tuna tartar and shrimp, which were both excellent. The entrees - skirt steak and salmon - were good, but nothing special.  The wait staff was very attentive, friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The cocktails were excellent.  Altogether, I had heard quite a bit about Oya and was looking forward to the meal; however, though the ambiance met our expectations (very good), I found the meal uninspired.</body>

        <body>I visit Oya every time I come to DC and generally love it.  However, this time the food was not up to the high standards I have come to expect from this restaurant.  The sushi I ordered was just so-so, actually pretty bland with little taste.  The squash soup, was so thick and floury it was almost a paste. No hint of spice or squash.  Every place can have an off night, so I will give them another try.</body>

        <body>Oya is a foodie destination.  Spectacular food and a stellar South Beach design vibe.  You&apos;re missing out if you don&apos;t have a meal here soon.  Service is just ok (wrong pronunciation of wine, offering recommendations when you first sit, a little too pushy), but that shouldn&apos;t keep you from going here for an awesome meal.</body>

        <body>I had been to OYA only once before and chose to go this second time for a small birthday dinner. And just like the previous visit I was not disappointed. I LOVE the ambiance and the all white decor of OYA. So modern, chic, just plain beautiful. The service was great. They were very accomodating when I had to add two guests last minute. Our waitress seemed to be very knowledgable of the ins and outs of the menu and was able to answer all of our questions. My friends and I all agreed that the food and cocktails were AWESOME. And because it was my birthday, they sent out a complimentary dessert which just happened to be my FAVORITE... red velvet cake! OYA just might be one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in DC!</body>

        <body>I highly recommend Oya! From the moment we stepped in to the moment we left, service was nothing less than fantastic. Chris Wilson the Manager was wonderful in assisting my group for a birthday dinner. Our waiter was very attentive to everyone and knowledgeable of the menu. I greatly appreciated how he paid close attention to the birthday girls food allergy. Every was great! I look forward to dining with Oya again!</body>

        <body>OYA is a great place to meet with friends during lunch and take advantage of the gorgeous views. Everyone is always professional and courteous. I have been eating executive lunch at Oya every few months since 2008. The food is delicious and fresh as well as varied. Keep up the good work.</body>

My only complaint is that the server did not seem too knowledgable about the menu.

        <body>My friends and I came to Oya for dinner late on a Friday night. The service was exceptional from the moment we walked in. Chris, the manager, remembered all three of our names and continued to check on us throughout the evening to ensure we were having a great experience. The food was great and the drinks were even better. We enjoyed the extended restaurant week menu, and absolutely loved it! I would definitely come to Oya again. I came with girlfriends, but would be a super romantic date spot.</body>

        <body>From the food to the service to the atmosphere, Oya is outstanding. There is so much care and attention to detail that goes into the cooking and preparation of the food. I have yet to try something I don&apos;t absolutely love. The atmosphere is fantastic whether you are having a romantic dinner for two or spending time with friends in the lounge. The drinks are unique and always delicious, and the service is unparalleled.</body>

        <body>My wife and I went here for the first time before a show. What a great find! Food was amazing, service was on point (big shout out to Alexis from FSU) and the atmosphere was great. very cool and we plan on going back ASAP.</body>

        <body>Sushi that goes  beyond a California roll or cream cheese  is hard to find but Oya goes way beyond. The rolls were absolutely amazing!! Red snapper &amp; hamachi rolls were to die for. Possibly the best we&apos;ve had in the country. We topped the rolls with the Bronzino and it was a perfect meal. Service was impeccable. Absolutely a perfect dining experience in a beautiful setting. In a city full of great restaurants this is a &quot;can&apos;t miss&quot;.</body>

        <body>I had proposed to me fiancee earlier in the day and this is where we enjoyed a very memorable celebratory dinner.  We had traveled into town from Boston so I asked a friend from the D.C. area for suggestions of a romantic restaurant, Oya was at the top of a short list.  I did some research and felt Oya would be perfect.  I was in no way disappointed and I believe my fiancee was blown away.   We were seated directly in front of what must be a 12 feet long fireplace.  Very romantic.  Another nice touch is the cascading waterfall that separates the kitchen from the restaurant. The food was excellent and the service was great.  There may be plenty of places to go for fine dining but for a special occasion Oya really delivers.</body>

        <body>Coming with fair expectations having read a few reviews I admit I am quite disappointed. The host appeared sure of herself and was in no way interested in accommodating a table request even though rain that day kept the restaurant not fully occupied. Sadly though the food was quite disappointing.i ordered the Branzini looking for a delicate fish. and it was, a whole fish well prepared and tasty. But not only were the vegetables too salty, now there was so much bacon that it completely overpowered the fish. What a disappointment. Finally, 14$ for a 0.1 l glass of wine?  It certainly didn&apos;t make me stay fo dessert or a drink as originally planned</body>

        <body>Our server Briana was outstanding.  We asked her about popular dishes and her favorites.  It helped us select what we wanted to order.  Everything was outstanding.  Plus, we asked for blue cheese olives with our drink and she delivered them on the side as we asked (many fail to do that and put it into our martini).  Plus we asked for onions on our Kale salad, the salad was terrific and the onions were there (often overlooked by other restaurant servers)  The branzini fish was perfect, veggies excellent too.  The Tyhpoon sushi was fresh and delicious also.  Thanks!</body>

        <body>This was by far the BEST BIRTHDAY Celebration with the best drinks, food, and service that I have experienced in many years! BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO! The night was Stunning. What a beautiful, ethereal, gorgeous place! Thank you to our great server Joseph and everyone on staff. Astoundingly good food, the infused cocktails were amazing. Just an astoundingly, beautifully run restaurant. OYA takes service to a high art. And to beat the band, my family in Wisconsin picked up the check. AMAZING restaurant. We cannot wait to come back and have recommended OYA to all our friends and colleagues.</body>

        <body>Our group included repeat diners and a few who were visiting Oya for the first time. Everyone enjoyed the meal - even if it was a little hard to hear each other given the energetic noise level. The sushi rolls are creative and tasty. Others enjoyed the restaurant week menu; the burger and fries received rave reviews from multiple diners. If you arrive during happy hour, drinks may be cheaper in the bar than at the table.</body>

        <body>Lunch was a treat beyond expectation.  We asked about the soup and the waiter, without being asked, brought us a sample.  The power Lunch delivered a punch.  Generous, finely cooked entrees were accompanied by crispy salads and a perfect size dessert.  We were a group if 6 and there wasn&apos;t one criticism or complaint.  We will go back soon!  The Palm lived up to its reputation.</body>

        <body>A classic restaurant.  Was in the city for a trade show and as it turned out the Palm was right down the street from where we were staying.  It was well worth the walk.   A great menu, excellent service, good food from appetizer to desert.  No wonder why it has been in the city for forever.</body>

        <body>Service was very good.  Food HORRIBLE!  I ordered the filet medallion lunch special.  The steak was grey &amp; disgusting, it looked boiled.  When i figured it wasn&apos;t boiled i realized it was microwaved.  It was grey, soft and DISGUSTING.  I will never go back.  DO NOT GO.</body>

        <body>Friendly greeting. Fantastic, delicious appetizers. Couldn&apos;t have been more pleased until our &quot;3 pound lobsters&quot; arrived. They weren&apos;t whole lobsters, they were pieced together lobsters. Huge claws with minuscule bodies. Their lobster description would&apos;ve been dead-on accurate if it said &quot;total weight 3 pound lobsters.&quot; When they arrived I complained to the manager who said that was the way they served their lobsters. Which I knew was false as I have had their lobsters at their other NYC locations before. When all was said and done bill for two was $320. When I called the next day I was told manager would call me back. After five days it was clear he wasn&apos;t calling so I called corporate headquarters and left vm. No return call. I called again and three days later received call from restaurant manager who after two minutes put me on hold and after waiting 25 minutes for him to return I hung up. Called corporate and completed survey card - nothing!!  But they have the nerve to continue </body>

        <body>Came to celebrate daughters 21st BD before a 7pm performance at a theater literally around the corner.  (The Book of Mormon).Perfect spot, great ambience, wonderful service &amp; delicious steaks! Passed the daughter test who had accused us of making reservations at &quot; an old persons restaurant&quot; but ended up saying it was a perfect NY experience!</body>

        <body>Consistently delicious steaks, salads and side dishes. Very attentive, warm service in a pleasant atmosphere, and a great pre-theatre destination.  It&apos;s  typically pricey, but  the cost is commensurate with other NYC steakhouses and you don&apos;t  have to tolerate a gruff and  cranky waitstaff.</body>

        <body>Went to NYC to see the Phantom for a one-night adventure from NC...  The Palm was excellent, from the hostess to waiter, had a pleasant personality, and the environment with hand-painted portraits of the &quot;stars&quot; that had been there... The food, was out-right delicious... definitely a Top 5 !</body>

        <body>It has become a fun trip to NYC for us from NJ. A show, most recently Wickef, Mama Mia and The Last Ship. We usually do an 11:45  lunch at the Palms West Side.  The waiters are all very careful and friendly. There is a great wine list. I have had the chicken parmegian twice now and it is thin and tender and delicious. Very nice place.</body>

        <body>If you want a really good steak in heart of Time Square for a reasonable price this is place. A little noisy , ambience is ok but steak and service was terrific.</body>

        <body>I expected to get a great steak which I did but the real surprise was the Sea Bass my wife ordered. I have never seen such a large portion served at any restaurant.  So I figured it won&apos;t be any good.  Man, was I wrong.  It was about as good as we have ever had. (My wife always orders Sea Bass-Mini Expert).   The Palm West in Manhattan is a Great place for pre-dinner show.  They are within a few minutes walk of close to 20 theaters. Overall Great Experience.</body>

        <body>While the food was ok, I expected a lot more due to the Palms reputation.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  Nothing was bad, just not great.  I&apos;d rather go to Ruth&apos;s Chris any day, especially when the bill for the Palm was $300 for two and I can go to Ruths Chris for $200-$250, order a similar dinner and get better food!</body>

        <body>Food was great. Service was fantastic. We had a Rib eye bone in which was cooked to perfection and two Gigi salads that was delicious.  We also had the carrot cake for two which should read for four. It was tasty and colossal in size. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends, family and anyone who wants a great meal.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to many Palm restaurants throughout the US.  I left this Palm feeling that there were two different meals served to customers -- one to &quot;regulars&quot; and one to tourists.   The restaurant clearly thought I was in the latter category because my wife and I ate early to catch a Broadway show.  I could have purchased the steak I was served at Gristede&apos;s.  No more Palms for me. There are too many good steak places around so be treated with contempt.</body>

        <body>Our server removed my starter place while  my guest was still eating his. A no no. The Meat (mignon) was well textured, low on flavour and over salted. The three cheese potatoes were a gooey, runny mess. For the quality, everything was overpriced. The wall murals conveys a sensation of being trapped in a large comic book. My seat faced a bad likeness of Natasha Richardson  with what read like someone else&apos;s name written alongside it.</body>

        <body>My wife and I are Palm loyalists.  We became 837 members almost 20 years, we&apos;ve had everything on most of the menus and there&apos;s never a misstep.  Until last week.  The appetizer that each of us ordered was unacceptable and my wife&apos;s steak was way overcooked.  We didn&apos;t complaint.  At first, we just smiled and said we were done, so please take the (barely eaten) appetizers back.  The waiter and maitre d&apos; could have been more apologetic and kind.  We didn&apos;t ask for anything else, but they comped a subsitute (caprese salad - cannot be better).  My wife&apos;s steak came.  All she did was cut it open and we could tell it was overcooked.  She was going to eat it anyway (you don&apos;t forego steak at the Palm) when our waiter mysteriously apparated, looked at the steak and just took it from her, promising the right substitute in minutes.  Again, the maitre d&apos; was elegant and apologetic.  Basically, while the kitchen clearly had an off night, the front of house made sure that we didn&apos;t.  Palm loyalis</body>

        <body>Exactly what you would expect. Keep it simple and you will love the food. Service was good. Only negative was the intense noise level. We had a round table of five and you could not hear across the table. Alas, that is the trend these days.</body>

        <body>Although service was very good on a Sunday around 5:30 the food missed our expectations. We have dined in many steak places including other Palms. The bill for two was nearly $300! Not heavy  drinkers</body>

        <body>Palm Restaurant never fails to deliver - steak is always cooked to perfection, love the retro iceberg lettuce, veggies (especially asparagus and spinach) are always good. Leave room for the donuts!</body>

        <body>The side dishes were a disappointment.  Although described as enough for a table of four, there was probably enough for two to share.  Steaks were not prepared correctly.  While I asked for my steak to be done medium, it came out closer to medium well.  My wife asked for hers to be medium well and there was still red meat, not pink, visible. Service was attentive.  Would recommend the bag of donuts desert.</body>

        <body>Split review: my wife thoroughly enjoyed the experience. She really liked the Sea Bass. Based on her experience, I could easily see visiting again. I saw things differently. With creamed spinach costing north of $7 as a side dish and about double for a shareable portion, I don&apos;t see how an establishment like this automatically assumes you want the large size unless you ask for that. It&apos;s worse when the patron points this out and there is no response from the waiter.  But that&apos;s nothing compared with realizing the filet at Texas Roadhouse tastes better than what I got here. On exiting, the manager asked how I liked things. I said the assistant waiter was wonderful and my wife&apos;s Sea Bass was great. Without me saying anything else, he said he hoped my experience would be better on a second visit. That sensitivity is enough for me to want to visit again on our next trip.</body>

        <body>Had dinner at the west-side Palm before theatre last night.  Service was excellent and the food was deliciously perfect.  We had the bone in rib-eye....it was done to perfection.  Appetizers and sides were all excellent!  Tracy our server was FABULOUS  and very mindful of our show time.  Haven&apos;t been to The Palm in a few years and now we can&apos;t wait to go back !  Eat there, you will be happy you did :)</body>

        <body>This was our second meal there. On both occasions the food was top-notch and the service very good. Cocktails were outstanding. The server did try to push a slightly higher item on the menu, which seemed out of character for this establishment, but otherwise, the service was solid, efficient and highly attentive. The food was as good as I&apos;ve had anywhere, which was true of our first visit there as well.  We will definitely be back.</body>

        <body>Went to The Palm Westside the other night for the first time in a long time. Clams were just ok, but I have to tell you, the strip steak for two, done Pittsburgh style was out of this world good! Great hash browns and sautéed spinach, plus EXCELLENT service, made this a great night. Will be back here soon!</body>

        <body>Having visited the Palm many times over the years, my family and I were particularly disappointed with our recent dinner. Portions are smaller, though still tasty. Overall not the dining experience we have enjoyed in the past. Additionally, the rest rooms were filthy. Despite commenting to the management, they were still dirty when we left. We won&apos;t be back.</body>

        <body>Valentines day, Romantic dinner and show planned. Service and dinner were great. Great bottle of wine. Dessert comes, my wife excuses herself to use the restroom. I am sitting waiting for her return and the leg of the table collapses and everything on the table is on the floor. Dessert and wine. They came fixed the table and cleaned up the mess. They brought us another dessert and a glass of cheap wine. When the bill came they charged us for the second dessert then only took $20.00 off the bill. I am sorry I don&apos;t usually look for something for nothing but this is poor customer relations. They sit us at a broken table (filling restaurant to capacity for a holiday) then charging for a second dessert when we didn&apos;t get a chance to finish the first  one. replacing a glass of a $110. bottle of wine with a glass of their cheapest wine and taking off $20 off a $300.00 bill and the manager telling us there is nothing else he can do. I hope they read this and learn that making the customer ha</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been to the Palm before and once again were not disappointed.  The service could not have  been better from the hostess to the wait staff, just everyone was as nice as could be.  We were seated immediately even though we were 20 min. late for our reservation. The food was superb as always from the appetizers to the entrée and desert.  Thank you &quot;palm&quot; for making our Valentine&apos;s Night very special.</body>

        <body>We were seated and someone brought over bread and menus.  20 minutes later no one came back over for a drink order or food order.  We were essentially forgotten at our table.  One of the waiters even went to a larger table and bypassed our table when we were trying to make contact to get someone over.  We got up and left afterward and notified the front desk.  Not a good sign for a Palm Restaurant.</body>

        <body>This was my second time eating at The Palm.....this time we had dinner at The Palm West.  From the moment we walked in the door to the time we left we felt and were treated as well as the celebrity that was sitting across from us.  Our server and bar staff were very friendly and let me just say, the dinner was spectacular.  I am from the mid-west and travel to NYC every Christmas Season and I will definitely make a point of dining at The Palm West  again.  Thank you for adding to my holiday pleasure of being in the city for Christmas.</body>

        <body>Very nice restaurant.  The food is very good, although a bit on the high priced side. To me the star of the show is the excellent service which is incredibly efficient but very low key and friendly as well.</body>

        <body>There were 10 of us and No one eight for less the $100.00.  Couple of items not cooked to what was ordered.  Not a lot of drinks - so the value provided for the price would be the reason for &quot;good&quot; but that&apos;s not what will get me to go back.  The cost for what we got in terms of an experience ...not a fair trade.</body>

        <body>but the sauce for the seared tuna - not as I remember it and not as good. Favorite - half and half onions and chips, Didn&apos;t have steak this time - next time key lime pie disappointing  next time creme bruelle or donuts</body>

        <body>My husband and I celebrated our birthdays here.  (Both in same month!).  They were more than accommodating when my husband asked if he could have his calamari sautéed instead of breaded and fried.  The wait staff is excellent.  The food was very good.  The only complaint I had was my salad....mixed greens w pomegranate was a bit bitter.  The dressing needed something. But everything else was superb.</body>

        <body>We chose Panzano&apos;s because it was in the hotel where we were staying. And what a delight to find that it not only has a creative and  menu, but the service is impeccable. The staff and management pay attention to the finest details, and clearly their focus is on helping its customers have a wonderful experience.   Next time I&apos;ll choose Panzano - not because it&apos;s convenient, but because it is one of downtown Denver&apos;s best.</body>

        <body>I took my girlfriend to Panzano for Valentine&apos;s Day. It was a great choice. We were greeted with drinks and light appetizers while we waited for our table and were welcomed by friendly staff. Our waiter was excellent and went above and beyond to accommodate gluten-free needs. The food was served surprisingly fast, and I tasted some of the best eggplant Parmesan i have ever put in my mouth. Overall, exceptional experience, and highly recommended.</body>

My new favorite restaurant, great for a couples get-away weekend staying at the hotel attached, and eating every meal at Panzano.</body>

        <body>We went for happy hour and were not let down in the least.  We got to experience several different dishes at an unbelievably reasonable price.  And we left stuffed!  This is definitely the way to go with a group, if you don&apos;t mind sitting in the bar and going a bit earlier to eat.  And every dish we had was superb.  I&apos;ve been for lunch before as well and wasn&apos;t disappointed.  A great restaurant in Denver that can easily be overlooked now with so many restaurants on the Denver scene.  Don&apos;t forget about Panzano&apos;s - it is delicious!</body>

        <body>Visited Panzano for Easter brunch - a delicious antipasti spread, plus entrée and dessert.  The service was a little spotty - unlike a normal meal at Panzano.  Will return for a business lunch or special occasion.</body>

        <body>We came for our anniversary, and everything about Panzanos made the night special and romantic.   We got there early and got drinks from the bar, then sat.  All of our food was delicious and beautiful.  The service was incredible and everyone was incredibly thoughtful and friendly.   Our night was wonderful and we will definitely be returning.</body>

        <body>We went to Panzanos on opening night of Denver Restaurant Week. The food on the set menu was good value for the price. The calamari and  brussels sprouts appetizers were really good. The main dishes were tasty, the desserts were ok, nothing spectacular. My only complaint is that it all felt rushed. I know it&apos;s Restaurant Week and there are a lot of reservations and people to get through, but there were no breaks in between courses. It just felt like they wanted to get us out as quickly as possible, rather then being able to enjoy a good meal, which detracted from the overall experience.</body>

        <body>We were celebrating both my husband&apos;s retirement and his birthday.  The staff at Panzanos made it a very special celebration.  We were treated to a glass a champagne when we arrived and they gave my husband a certificate for a free dessert at our next visit.  We sat at the Chef&apos;s table and were very entertained by the chefs keeping up with all the orders coming their way!  The food was delicious and our waiter, Jose, was very attentive.  It was one of the best dining experiences we have had.  Thanks to all!</body>

        <body>Our second visit was during Denver Restaurant week. The only reservation available was for 4:00 pm, a little on the early side. Our waiter was prompt, efficient, personable &amp; knowledgeable. The early time frame turned out to be perfect for appetizers and drinks and we were not rushed by the staff at all. The food, just as in our first visit, was exceptional. From their various house baked breads with tapenade, through the salad or soup course to entrees and desert.  The evening was delightful and we will definitely return.</body>

        <body>We chose to dine at Panzano because it was associated with the Hotel Monaco when we stayed for one night in Denver. We would be arriving late, tired and hungry. And it was great to not have to go very far to get an outstanding meal.  I would not hesitate to go back even if we were staying someplace else.  Menu items hinted at traditional but with original twists. And because it was so late, we didn&apos;t want to eat a huge heavy meal. Our server, Jose, was very helpful in offering and describing a variety of options and choices so that we could get exactly what we needed.</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been to Panzano&apos;s before and always look forward to the evening/brunch there.  On this occasion, we were seeing theater at the Buell Theater after dinner at Panzano&apos;s.  Everything we ordered was excellent, lovely presentations and yummy!  Our wait staff could not possibly be topped anywhere, informed with great suggestions, timely for course changes and happy to be there!  Made the evening even more enjoyable.  Yes, we&apos;ll be back many times!</body>

It was our first time at Panzano and we were amazed by our whole experience, the staff was GREAT, the food was AMAZING, and they took the extra time to make us feel special. We will definitely be back, best experience we have had and this is now one of our favorite restaurants.</body>

        <body>We brought a group of six in for a birthday and everything was fabulous, from the food to the service. There were two gluten-free folks in the group who were excited to choose from their own &quot;safe&quot; menu, and even got to have their own bread while waiting for dinner. Our table was in an awkward, busy corridor, but that was my only complaint.</body>

        <body>Went with a party of 4 for brunch on a Sunday at 10:00am.  They have a good deal on bottomless mimosas or bellinis and a huge menu compared to other places nearby serving brunch.   The only downside was that they were out of the strata (my first choice), and out of the polenta cake normally used for the Benedict (2nd choice).  Either way, I went with the inlet special of the day and it was delicious.  The server forgot to ring in our order but was honest and apologetic, which I respect.   I will return.</body>

        <body>The staff was incredibly helpful, respectful and understanding. We had our 6 month old with us and I was nervous about bringing him to a nice restaurant but everyone we encountered was very accommodating. From stowing our stroller to providing warm water for the baby food and even rinsing off a toy he had dropped on the floor. All without complaint. Excellent service!</body>

        <body>I had to wait over 10 minutes for my 12:30 pm reservation.  My party of 3 was then seated at a table for 10!  Not conducive for a private business conversation.  I will go back though, as this is the first time I have ever been disappointed @ Panzano. As usual, the food was great.</body>

        <body>We were on vacation for a long weekend and loved the food so much we came twice.  Had the brussel sprouts, flatbreads, veal, arancini, soup, polenta and it was all delicious!  Two standouts were the mushroom risotto and the toffee pudding.  Good service and fairly quiet.  Music needs a lot of work, but we found that to be the case it most of the places we went.  BAD MUSIC!!  Otherwise, a perfect evening twice!</body>

        <body>Eaten at Panzano&apos;s on many special occasions and for business lunches during the past 15 years.  Service and food are consistently excellent and never disappoint.  Will continue to frequent this restaurant despite other similar high quality Italian restaurants in the area.</body>

        <body>We visited Panzano because the chef was from our small home town. We let her know ahead of time we were coming. My 19 yr old was excited to meet her but Chef Elise Wiggins was too busy in her &quot;office&quot; to come out. The food was ok but it did not make a big enough impression for me to go out of my way again. The scallops were undercooked.  The servers were very nice.</body>

        <body>Our experience at Panzano was completely perfect.  First off, they let me make an Open Table reservation for TWENTY without calling.  I love that.  The host was gracious when we checked in a bit early, and directed us to the bar for drinks while the staff finished setting up our table.  Bloody mary&apos;s were amazing.  From there, our server Chris took amazing care of our large party, keeping us on track without being intrusive or impatient.  Bottomless drinks kept coming, food was delicious, everyone was lovely, and EVERYONE in our party commented on it.  We&apos;ll all be back soon!</body>

        <body>We are from out of town and came to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary at Panzano&apos;s on the recommendation of our local friends.  The service by Ron was outstanding,. He was attentive, patient and very knowledgeable about the many wonderful and delicious food and wine choices. The food courses were served at a very comfortable pace. The support staff kept the table neat and the water glasses full. The greet  staff was very warm and welcoming. They accommodated our daughter&apos;s long distance request surprise us by covering out bill by phone and credit card. We recommend this restaurant highly.</body>

        <body>Usually go here for happy hour which I love as it features appetizers which are smaller versions of the entrees.  Delicious food with a good menu selection.  Unique items on the menu.  Happy hour give one the opportunity to try items before ordering for a meal.</body>

        <body>Panzano was even better than we anticipated.  Beautiful place with delicious food and wine list.  It was restaurant week, and the 4 course selections were amazing! We will definitely go there again when we are in Denver.</body>

        <body>We visited Denver over teh weekend and loved our meal at  Panzano. The three of us sampled  their soup of the day (Brussell Sprout and Apple - excellent), Insalata Mista (excellent), and their Ceasar (excellent). For entrees we tried their Pastiche (rich but very good),  Tortellini con Zucca di Giala (excellent) and Melanzane Fritte (excellent). For dessert we shared Budino Di Caramello (excellent) and  the Cioccolato Creme Brulee (very good). Our server was informative and helpful but a wee bit on teh slow side. This was our best meal in Denver and we would love to visit again someday.</body>

        <body>Everything was outstanding.  Our server was professional, friendly, and right on point with all of his recommendations.  They offer most of the pasta dishes in 1/2 portions and my two cents would be take advantage of that and try as many of their dishes as you can!  The almond &amp; marscapone tortelloni with sage brown butter was one of the best things I have EVER eaten.  They had a wonderful management presence also.  Dan came to the table to introduce himself and check in on our meal.  The night could not have been better.</body>

        <body>Date night was a fabulous evening at Panzano&apos;s. Service was unbelievably respectful and accommodating for a quiet, romantic, evening. My boyfriend loved everything about it! From the fried Brussels Sprouts to the scallops with cauliflower puree and I loved my steak cooked perfectly as expected. A couple of glasses of Italian Prosecco and we topped off an amazing evening.</body>

        <body>Dined there during Denver Restaurant Week, we were an hour late due to bad weather and lack of cabs, but the restaurant was super great about it, amazing service throughout, the food was great, but it was the dessert that really sticks out in my mind, I had the Olive Oil cake with goat cheese mousse, outstanding! The portions for the meal seemed small, but we were all totally stuffed by the end! I will definitely be going back, two thumbs up, or really, eight thumbs up from everyone at our table, well done!</body>

        <body>This was our first visit to Panzano and we were very impressed. The dining room is comfortable and we were seated quickly. Our waiter was prompt and very knowledgeable about the food and beverages and when we were chatting before ordering, he gave us plenty of time. His recommendations were great- the grilled Caesar salad was fantastic- and the other items we ordered were outstanding. I loved the almond tortellini and my husband raved about the carbonara dish. The Caramel Budino with sour whipped cream was out of this world! We ate here midweek and the dining room was hopping!</body>

        <body>We ate at Panzano&apos;s on New Years eve with our two teenage children.   Server was friendly, prompt, and knowledgable.   Among us, had the mushroom crepes, prosciutto flatbread,  lasagna, t-bone steak, lamb ragu, and carbonara Panzano…not a miss among them.   Accompanied the food with a bottle of Masi Amarone…they have a great selection of amarone&apos;s, one of my favorite Italian Wines.  Consistently great food and service…will be back!</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been here twice for restaurant week in the past few years and it has always been my favorite every year. The food is amazing, and the portions are more than substantial. Everyone in our group could not finish and had to take some home. The service is remarkable and very fast. Even though the place is always full when I&apos;ve gone, it never gives you the sense of being overly packed, and it isn&apos;t too noisy for conversation at the table.</body>

        <body>How often does a restaurant pass hors d&apos;oeuvres and prosecco while you wait for your table to be cleared?  Definitely set the tone for a fabulous meal!  The sea scallops were cooked to perfection and the butterscotch pudding for dessert is not to be missed.  Our waiter, Jose, was professional, friendly, knowledgable and attentive.  Can&apos;t wait to go back!</body>

        <body>I book Panzano every year for Denver Restaurant Week.  This is an opportunity for me to enjoy restaurants that I normally cannot afford.   Although the portions have been decreasing over the years, this year took the cake.  Two scallops as an entree?  Two scallops surrounded by bland fingerling potatoes= bland.    Seared scallops are a delightful sweet, yet flavorful combination.  Pairing the two (not very generous) scallops with potatoes was a total dud.    If Panzano insists on only 2 scallops, pair them with something that doesn&apos;t dull the taste.  Maybe asparagus, broccoli or something else.    Don&apos;t try to look at the bottom line so much and quit the potatoes.  Very disappointing and I think I&apos;m crossing Panzano off my list of favorites.  Just my thoughts.</body>

        <body>This time, and we&apos;ve been to Panzano&apos;s quite a few times over the years...we sat at the Chef&apos;s Counter.  Great experience.  We wanted one of everything!</body>

        <body>This an an excellent choice for those that are gluten free.   The food is very good (we have been 4 times brunch and dinner).   Highly recommend the house aged drinks, scallops, short rib special, mushroom pizza, Brussels sprouts, asparagus and egg special.</body>

        <body>Our waiter was very kind and helpful. The menu can be intimidating for none foodies. The pasta and bread were hand made and you could really tell the difference. The iPad drink menu was a nice touch. They had a lot of Italian wine which is to be expected being an Italian restaurant but they should carry a bit more Californian wine as well.</body>

        <body>Everything was amazing! It was my boyfriends birthday and they gave us a free champagne cheers. It was a little bit later than I wanted (supposed to be served with dessert) but they made up for the mistake by taking 2 glasses of wine off of our bill! Awesome!!</body>

        <body>Our experience at Panzano was great, start to finish.  Our waitress was welcoming and helpful.  We can be a bit difficult as my husband has both gluten and dairy allergies but she was able to provide many choices for him.  The brussel sprouts appetizer is the best I&apos;ve ever had.  The lasgna and salmon specials were both a bit unique, well prepared, and very tasty.  I really appreciated getting suggestions for wine to pair with dinner and several nonalcoholic choices for my husband.  We were able to relax and enjoy a delicious meal!</body>

        <body>Brunch this time.  The eggs benedict are stunning; the omelet is an omelet.  Get the specialty dishes.  There&apos;s a reason they are touted as specialties of the house.  Oh, and the calamari and brussel  sprout appetizers are to die for!  Food is great for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Just don&apos;t order boring if you&apos;re looking for  something that&apos;s not!</body>

        <body>Once again, Panzano&apos;s exceeds expectations--wonderful, barrel-aged new drinks in bar (Negroni with barrel aged rum, New Fashion) with those fabulous brussel sprouts and other tasty Italian appetizers!  The dinners were outstanding for all four of us--from scallops, to steak, to lamb ragu pasta, to duck!   The service was excellent.  The bread a treasure in itself.  This restaurant is the very best in Denver!</body>

        <body>We really enjoyed the ambience and atmosphere of the bar and restaurant. We thought the happy hour and appetizers were superb. We lucked out because it was restaurant week so we had a beautiful 4 course dinner.</body>

        <body>I loved Panzano! We came here for brunch this past weekend and gobbled up every morsel of food. And $9 bottomless bellinis?! Yes, please!   Everything on the menu looked so good - it was so hard to decide what we wanted to order! We finally settled on the mushroom omelette, cinnamon french toast, burger, and an omelette special, but will definitely have to come back to try some more of the menu...or everything else. I&apos;m not even a big mushroom fan, but ordered the mushroom omelette and loved it! Egg whites, goat cheese, basil pesto and mushrooms = bomb.   We shared bites and it was just one of those times when everyone loves everyone else&apos;s food. We even sprung for dessert - tiramisu and butterscotch pudding - and savagely tried to block each other&apos;s spoons.   We&apos;re already planning to come back for dinner during restaurant week!</body>

        <body>We enjoyed a birthday celebration for a friend at Panzano’s.  The food choices were delightful as was the wait staff.  The portions were large so we had enough leftovers for one of us, me, to use for another meal.  In addition, my food allergy to melons was accommodated to use berries instead which I appreciated a lot.  Everyone left happy and sated.</body>

        <body>If you have allergies, this is the place to go.  Our waiter went out of his way to accommodate our family allergies and even brought something special to the table for our daughter.  Their gluten free bread is delicious and so are the selections of other allergy friendly foods.</body>

        <body>We had a belated Christmas dinner get together and it was a great choice.  The service was outstanding and the food wonderful.  I&apos;m celiac so it was very nice to have a restaurant that can accommodate the situation.  The server was also very knowledgeable in regards to a person with celiac and guided me away from a potential cross contamination possibility.</body>

        <body>My husband and I LOVE Panzano.  We enjoy this restaurant twice a year or so.  This year we went for my birthday.  We were treated very well, and our server, Brian, gave us the best service ever.  He was funny, engaged and timed our meal progression perfectly.  Our food was delish!  The mussels were the best I&apos;ve had.  We will be back.</body>

        <body>Panzano&apos;s was a gem of a find.  We took some clients there based on other reviews.  Although the menu is a bit limited, what they did offer was excellent.  Everyone raved about their meals.  The best part of the evening was the service.  Jose is an outstanding waiter. He explained the menu thoroughly and asked about food allergies (and made sure to accommodate them).  He is very friendly and knowledge.  Great experience - ask for Jose!!!</body>

        <body>This is the second year in a row that we have dined at Panzano during Restaurant Week with our son and daughter-in-law.  As always the gluten-free and vegetarian options were delicious and interesting, and the conversation in our comfortable booth scintillating.  Our server was knowledgeable and the food served perfectly.  Since it was Restaurant Week, and there were diners awaiting our table, the removal of plates and glasses happened a little more often and more quickly than would usually be the case, but we understand that.  All in all a wonderful evening!  We will be back!!</body>

        <body>Are experience was not great but not horrible. Our server was descent in the beginning but mostly full of nonsense which was uncalled for. The appetizers are pretty good. As for our main course to much going on! &quot;Chef needs to keep it simple&quot;. The creme brulee dessert was very good, we were impressed with that. Did not like the seating we were put next to the window as it was very cold. Had to wear my coat while dinning. Not to comfortable! Was unaware that there&apos;s free parking,no where on website nor hosstess never mentioned it. &quot;$10.00 later&quot; Will not be going back due to our server making a obnoxious and uncalled for comment towards my husband. Inappropriate and very unprofessional on his part because of that we will definitely not be returning...</body>

        <body>Panzano was AWESOME. Not only was there tasty classic italian dishes but also new and innovative plates. And definitely consider sitting at the chef&apos;s counter... We were celebrating a belated birthday and the experience at the counter was PERFECT... a tad more privacy, exceptional service from the wait staff as well as fun interactions with the chef team!</body>

        <body>I had been wanting to revisit Panzano for some time having had wonderful Panzano experiences before and this evening did not disappoint.  For me, the highlight was the Capesante - scallops on a cauliflower puree (I could eat the puree as a soup!)  Being so close to the Performing Arts complex, Panzano is perfect for a theater evening whether the meal is after a matinee or before an evening show.</body>

        <body>We were initially delighted to be seated in a booth towards the back of the upper level beyond the kitchen until a large noisy party was seated at the long center table that was actually quite close to us. Those chairs were so close that I had to squeeze between my booth and 2 of the chairs in order to get out of the booth. We always enjoy a good meal at Panzanos, but we couldn&apos;t hear each other across the table once the large group sat down. Fortunately, we were almost through our main course, but the noise level got so bad we did not want to linger and have another glass of wine. Too bad, because there are other booths (particularly next to the window) where we have been seated several times, and this doesn&apos;t happen because the nearest table is far enough away. We would have stayed around longer if the noise hadn&apos;t been so unpleasant. We&apos;re very glad that Panzano is now such a favorite place, and the place was full when we left, so it was a busy Sunday night! Glad we came a little e</body>

        <body>We took some friends to dinner for their first Panzano dining experience.  They said they really enjoyed the food and drinks.  This was a repeat visit for us.  We had the pasta with goat cheese, cranberries, pine nuts &amp; lemon which was so flavorful yet light and &apos;refreshing&apos;.  The other dish we shared was the grouper on pumpkin gnocchi.  The fish was cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside , tender and moist on the inside.  The gnocchi was very flavorful and tender.  The butterscotch pudding was superb.  Service was great - as always.</body>

        <body>The food, as always was unique, delicious and plentiful. The Pastiche, especially, was amazing - spicy meatballs layered with cheese tortellini and cinnamon custard. The fried Brussels sprouts appetizer was incredibly tasty and plenty for four people. Great selection of wines and draft beers. I&apos;ve been eating at Panzano for many years, and they have never lost a step - they are still fresh and unique every time. Also, my wife is gluten-free, and they were very accommodating to her needs.</body>

        <body>We have been to Panzano&apos;s before and it is a good choice for a special occasion.  Not the run-of-the-mill menu and they provide a creative selection.  But this all comes with a price, so we don&apos;t frequent them as often as we wish.</body>

        <body>I have been to Panzano&apos;s several times for dinner, and this time we went for Brunch.  My eggs were just too dry (omellette).  I was disappointed in what I ordered but everything else was good and we had a very nice time.  I will still be going there for lunch and dinner, and might even try Brunch again, but will try a different Menu Item.</body>

        <body>Had a wonderful dinner with friends.  Service was excellent ~ best I have had in a long time.  We spent 3 hours having a leisurely dinner and did not feel rushed once which is very unusual.   Food was very good.  I saw another review about the wine list and I would agree ~ need some more reasonably priced wines.  You can always find a reasonable house wine in Italy so would expect the same thing at a good Italian restaurant. But overall, highly recommend.</body>

        <body>Stayed at a different hotel, but noticed this place while walking.  Clean, interesting vibe amd looked inviting.  Read some reviews about the chef and decided to give it a try.  Staff from front end to the back were terrific and the two kitchens. One for baking and one traditional, are neat, open and very quiet.  The Executive Chef was cooking and pleasant to talk with.  Even sharing recipes.  If back in Denver, will definitly visit again.</body>

        <body>Panzano is a wonderful restaurant with incredible food, drinks, and service. I would highly reccomended it and will be going back myself to try out their regular fare. The only issue I had was the waitstaff was a little *too* attentive. It felt like someone was constantly coming up to the table to ask how we were or take something away or add new silverware.  The progression of the meal was incredible! There was just enough time between courses where you could appreciate the food you had just eaten before being given another plate.  My recommendation is to have the mushroom crepe if it is on the menu, it is amazing!!</body>

        <body>...but I have to say I was disappointed. The minuscule servings were not very good. Noise level impossible -- not a place to go to relax.  Seemed like we had 3 or 4 different servers.  Perhaps my experience was due to Restaurant Week. I hope to go back for a real meal to see what Panzano is really about.</body>

        <body>We went to the restaurant on a Saturday night and ended up with more people coming at the last minute so they were very accommodating to our larger number. Overall, we thought the food was good, some really liked their food and some were more restrained, so the sentiment was mixed.  My hubby and I had the meatballs and we felt there was something lacking.  My girlfriend raved about the   scallops, and the appetisers we had were all good as we had calamari and the special was a pork prosciutto dish.  Very tasty.  The service was impeccable and the wait staff was super nice, so we would go again, but maybe try something different.</body>

        <body>Can&apos;t say enough about the consistency of everything at Panzano.  Food, service, and ambiance.  We ate early on New Year&apos;s Eve, and had the choice of a FULL menu, not a New Year&apos;s Eve &quot;only a couple of choices&quot; menu.  What can we say about the food but WOW!  Our server Michael was attentive and knowledgeable and very pleasant to talk to.  (He told us that they expected to serve 400 meals that night.....again, off a full menu!)  We love Panzano and recommend it highly!</body>

        <body>My wife and I recently celebrated our Anniversary here. We arrived a little early and decided to try the much talked about cocktails at the bar. A little bit on the pricey side but when we received them they were amazing inspired works of mixology. We had the Italian Blood and Sand which is now my favorite Cocktail in Denver. We were meet by and seated by or server who made us feel welcome and that we were his only concern for the evening even though the dining room was near capacity. The noise level was quite low for the number of people and even the staff in the open Kitchen looked relaxed and choreographed. The menu is small which is a good ting it points you too what they do well. We both decided what we wanted, that is until our server described the nights specials, which immediately changed our minds. The food was worth the wait, the seafood in the stew were cooked perfectly, the Shrimp and Calamari could have easily gone from perfect to overdone and chewy but somehow came out p</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been here a few times before and wanted to bring my friend for her birthday dinner. It was lovely from start to finish! Dimitri was very attentive-even giving us a free salmon cake bite in an aioli sauce, free dessert for the birthday girl, and a hand-written note on the back of a card with a free dessert offer!   We had wine by the glass. The selection is very good. Then we had the Brussels sprouts appetizer- one Panzano is known for and for good reason!  The breads with the dipping sauce/tapenade was wonderful!  Then came the main course. I went off-menus for the chicken Alfredo, and my friend had the diver scallops. Both were very good. I was disappointed in the fettuccine noodles, though. They were thick like a homemade spaghetti, not thin like the fettuccine/angel hair I asked for. An al dente thick spaghetti noodle is quite chewy!  And the chicken was brined too long and was extremely salty.  And I love salt! The lady in the booth behind us complained about her meal being t</body>

        <body>I come here often and it never disappoints!  The food is always of high quality and cooked well.  We will absolutely be back and would recommend this restaurant to others!  Don&apos;t be fooled by the fact that it&apos;s connected to a hotel.... the food is amazing!</body>

        <body>We went here during Restaurant Week and it was very good value during that time. We had been wanting to try Panzano for quite a while but have always thought it was a bit pricey. So, Restaurant Week was our opportunity. It was very busy even at the early hour we had to have dinner. Despite that, the service was attentive &amp; excellent.  The food was good but not sure it was up to their regular prices. The fried brussel sprouts were excellent as was the mushroom crepe. The tomato/mozzarella soup was good although not the best I have had. The grilled Caesar salad was just OK as were the main courses: Pasta with lamb ragu and veal with mashed potatoes.  Dessert was, once again, good but not outstanding. The goat cheese mousse cake was just too much goat cheese (not a mild one, either) and too little cake. The  chocolate/lavender creme brulee was very nice.  Glad we went but don&apos;t think we would go back unless we had another opportunity like Restaurant Week.</body>

        <body>If you call Panzano&apos;s a week or so in advance, they will make your favorite dish.  Ours is their short ribs. Any way they want to prepare them is a winner. A new dessert was a big hit. It&apos;s the chocolate creme brûlée with a hint of lavender. I could go back just for that. Their chicken liver mousse was a creamy delight.</body>

        <body>I chose Panzano for my birthday dinner with friends and as usual, it did not disappoint.  This was the first time for some of our party and they also loved it.  Everything was great - service and food.  I had the carbonara and it was fantastic.  Two individuals had the lamb ragu and cleaned their plates!  The calamari was also cooked perfectly.  Drinks were spot on.  A fantastic dining experience which is why I will keep returning.</body>

        <body>Panzano&apos;s is elegant but not over the top.  The restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly.  One of the best meals my husband and I had in quiet sometime.  I had the chicken has gnocchi and my husband the eggs Benedict both dishes had a modern twist and were delicious.  I  highly recommend Panzano.</body>

        <body>We went there for Denver Restaurant week and it was excellent-- we will go back. In a vibrant setting of downtown Denver. A little oasis of unexpected elegance. Classy atmosphere, wonderful service, delicious food. Only concern were the seemingly small portions. Yet we were all surprisingly satisfied by the end of the meal. Excellent place to take visitors if you want to impress them!</body>

        <body>Went to Panzano before the theater.  What a treat!  The decoration is art deco, charming but not over-the-top.  The food, from the first course to the last, was outstanding.  We did not taste a single dish that was not wonderful.  The service was very helpful, attentive and not suffocating.  All in all, a marvelous spot for a fine dinner.  We&apos;ll be back!</body>

        <body>My friend treated me to brunch at Panzano&apos;s for my birthday.  We love going to Panzano because I eat gluten free the majority of the time, and my friend has Celiac disease, and they have a great GF menu, and GF focaccia bread  However this time, it didn&apos;t go very well.  Our server seemed very rushed and short with us, and really didn&apos;t take the time to listen or get the clarification she needed to ensure our meals were gluten free.  As a result, my friend had to send her meal back since it had been in the fryer. Our server needs more training on what Celiac&apos;s is, and how to slow down and listen, and how to share less of her personal opinions regarding what people order (GF focaccia bread with jelly) unless she is asked.  Normally we have very good experiences at Panzano, and normally the servers are very personable, as well as aware of the preparation and precautions to take with gluten free meals, and diners who have Celiac disease.  At least the food was good.</body>

        <body>My boyfriend and I couldn&apos;t stop raving about the food! We ordered off the Denver Restaurant Week menu and the portions were great and we really felt like we got a wonderful taste of what Panzano&apos;s chefs are capable of. The lavendar chocolate creme brulee...OMG! To die for. So was the lamb ragu. The food also came out quickly and our waiter was very attentive.</body>

        <body>My daughter (22) and I were in from out of town and had no reservations but wanted a special father daughter dinner.  We didn&apos;t want any chain restaurants so we searched for something unique.  My daughter was in the mood for duck and I always like anything Italian so this was a perfect match.  While the menu is not your southern italian it was a nice blend of northern italian with some specialty dishes that had more of a French influence.  You won&apos;t find Lasagna or Spaghetti here for sure.  Everything was fantastic.  The server was excellent.  Very comfortable, not overly attentive and not hard to find.  Very knowledgeable as well and gave some great suggestions.  The calamari was excellent wit a spicy twist in the breading.  My Daughter loved here roast duck.  I had the lamb dish that was very tasty.</body>

        <body>Panzano wasn&apos;t where we originally intended to celebrate our 20th Anniversary, but that&apos;s how it worked out, and it worked out extremely well. The service was attentive, friendly, helpful, but the food was spectacular. We split a couple of course, but went for our own entrees and salads. Everything was excellent, with the lamb ragu pasta a particular hit.  We&apos;ll be back again.</body>

        <body>My wife and I loved the food too many choices made it hard to decide. The waiter we had was great, he was right there when we needed something or a recommendation but was not at all overbearing . We did not feel rushed indeed we felt very comfortable and relaxed. Many places we have been want to just move you thru and get another group at the table. We did not feel like just a number on the list. We will return and we will recommend you to others!</body>

        <body>My partner is in the food business and is very particular .. We&apos;ll both felt that this restaurant is excellent.. Our server was outstanding !  The grilled Caesar was delicious , as was the calamari and scallops.  We had breakfast this morning and the frittata and baked goods were the best we&apos;ve ever had.  We can&apos;t wait to go back!</body>

        <body>We had been dining at PANZANO the first few years they  were open. Then some years later we would go here and there. We recently rekindled our love for PANZANO. It has never disappointed us in any way. The food is more than delicious. When making a choice, from a simple not cluttered menu,  the description is mouth watering. Then you take your first bite everything  you thought it might be, it IS! It continues to delight your tastebuds with every bite. The mussels were prepared to just the right tenderness. Soak the crostini in the broth, wow. Homemade pasta, of course. Tagliatelle di Rosmarino has a fresh lemon taste. Simple ingredients used at their best. That is what you will find with all of the dishes on the menu. Breakfast, oh yes! Chicken Gnocchi Hash is not a mushy combination of leftovers. Pulled chicken combined with onions, peppers and herbs. If that wasn&apos;t enough add in the gnocchi topped with prosecco hollandaise sauce! Oh and eggs on top. Walnut bread toast. Thank you! W</body>

        <body>Pazano is a &quot;go to&quot; restaurant for us whenever we are in Denver, and have been going there for 10 years.  The food is outstanding, and we always have the grilled Caesar salad, and the eggplant either as an appetizer, or entree.  The mussels were also outstanding this time, and all the entrees were done perfectly.  The entree selection is always good, and you want to order it all! The wine this time was a 2010 Marchesi de Frescabldi Nipannzano Chianti, and excellent, though some what overpriced. (should be $45-50 instead of $60)  The wine list is ok, but not what I&apos;d call outstanding.  Doesn&apos;t compare to an outstanding wine list like Reef in Houston, TX.  But that small negative doesn&apos;t and should not keep anyone from eating there, as it is one of the best restauants in the US.  And the service was and always is impeccable.</body>

        <body>Stayed at the Hotel Monaco so thought we would try Panzano.  Heard great things and they were all true.  Just make sure you have a reservation or you are probably not getting a seat.  Even on wednesday or thursday night.  Apparently the word is out.  Everything we ordered was just outstanding, great service.   Couldn&apos;t be more pleased.</body>

        <body>We dined at Panzano prior to attending the theater. Our waiter was so helpful making sure we kept to our schedule. The food was superb. We  started with calamari, and had Caesar salads. My husband had the lamb argue and I had the carbonara. Both dishes were absolutely wonderful. We shared a bottle of Italian Sauvignon Blanc which was also very tasty.</body>

        <body>The food is always good at Panzano. I&apos;m not sure why, but my waiter was flustered a bit when I asked him about the soup of the day and he described it as a cream of acorn squash. I wasn&apos;t looking for a cream based soup, so I didn&apos;t order it. I later her him describe it to the table next to us as a roasted acorn squash soup with no cream. That was a little bothersome. I would have liked to try that soup.  The service was very attentive, but almost overly so. I am very pregnant and eat slowly due to lack of space. When my husband would finish his course, the waiter would immediately clear his plate and utensils and then hover over me while I ate mine. More than once I had to ask him not to take my plate as I was clearly still working on finishing the food on it. I even had my fork and knife in hand, bite midway to my mouth. The one time I finished first, during the entree course, my empty plate sat and sat, because my husband hadn&apos;t finished. It seemed weird that they were so focused on</body>

        <body>we came with another couple and had a great time.  The steaks and seafood were fantastic (I had the salmon and could not decide which was better - the salmon, the sauce on top or the sauce on the side).  The waitress was above and beyond friendly (Meghan) even though we were there for almost 3 hours.</body>

        <body>For the prices paid the food should be served hot, not luke warm.  Next time I want a really good Ribeye, I&apos;ll make it myself on my Weber grill.  The great service provided by Tom almost made up for the mediocre food but, not enough to make me return.</body>

        <body>The service from Jason was excellent.  Would ask for his table if that were possible.  The serving portions were human scale and not the &quot;glutoness&quot; portions we have seen at other high end restaurants.  A must have on the sides are the loaded mashed potatoes and the mushroom spinach gratin.  The steak and the prime rib were done exactly as ordered.</body>

        <body>This was our second trip to PB and it was as great as the first! I love a great steak and good sides and PB has them. I would say that between my 2 trips, I have had the 2 best steaks I have ever had. The bacon wrapped fillet and the Cowboy are the 2 I have tried and I love the PB hashbrowns with Tabasco, bacon and blue cheese. Amazing!!</body>

        <body>Disappointed with visit.  Even though we had reservations indicating we were celebrating a birthday, we were offered a table in a poor location.  We were given a better table upon request, but shouldn&apos;t have to ask.  Give those to walk-ins.  Waiter was excellent.  Good knowledge of menu and suggestions.  Attentive without being a bother.  I had prime rib.  Asked for it RARE. Their menu states &quot;cold red center&quot;. I arrived cold, but light pink.  MEDIUM at best.  Our waiter agreed it was overdone and got me a different cut within 5 minutes.  It was MEDIUM RARE. Dark pink and warm all the way through. Waiter agreed it wasn&apos;t RARE either. Didn&apos;t want to wait again.  If there is a next time,  I will try the steak.  My wife&apos;s steak was done correctly.</body>

        <body>We were in town for business and a friend suggested Pittsburg Blue was a must. Boy was he right, the food was outstanding both Steaks and seafood, and the service was friendly and over the top helpful.</body>

        <body>Pittsburgh Blue is one of the best high-end restaurants in the Twin Cities.  Located at the end of the trendy Arbor Lakes Shoppes, the food is exceptional, the service is outstanding and the ambiance oozes trendy and energetic.  The price tag is not low, but there is a great variety of items, from exceptional seafood to mouth-watering steaks.  Their sides are also top-of-the-line, with rich sauces and seasoned to perfection.  Great for any special occasion.  So although it is a little more spendy than the other upscale restaurants in the immediate vicinity, you will not be disappointed.  The experience is well worth the price!</body>

        <body>It was our 50th wedding anniversary and was very disappointed.  Had the $60 lobster tail and it was very tough.  I mentioned it to the manager, because the waitress never came and asked how our meal was,  All he said was I am sorry.  We have other good restaurants in the city, where they treat the guests better.</body>

        <body>For the most part, I don&apos;t like most chicken cooked in fast food restaurants. Why? Because it is either too salty or very dry.   The chicken/pork club sandwich was perfect in balanced flavors and seasoning.  Thank you for the wonderful experience and waitress that we had during our meal.  We will return for a meal.

        <body>Went here for a early V-day dinner, both ordered Filet, both came out lukewarm at best. Mine was overdone, server took it back, next one came out under which at that point I just ate. Wife&apos;s mushroom sauce was congealing and cold and tasted just terrible. Neither steak had any seasoning at all. Contacted management after the fact to explain our situation so their food would improve since the restaurant is near us, didn&apos;t hear anything back. I guess our dinner experience doesn&apos;t matter to them, not planning on going back. If you are going to spend $40 on a steak go to a proper steakhouse.</body>

        <body>Really, the only &quot;beef&quot; I have with this place is the noise level, and that is bearable. We were able to hold a conversation with the four of us, not sure how things would be at a larger table.  Yes, it is a bit pricey, but the portions are so large that we bring home half to eat the following day. Servers are knowledgeable and efficient. I absolutely recommend Pittsburgh Blue!</body>

        <body>I commend the waiter for sharing that the sides are large enough to share.  It would have been disappointing to have ordered more and thrown it away.  They should really be congratulated for their honestly although it cost them revenue.  I would go back for any special occasion!  It was very good.</body>

        <body>I came to Pittsburgh Blue with a coworker and we were meeting with another person. The person didn&apos;t show up for a while and the staff allowed us to wait up front and held our table for us. They treated us like valued patrons and I really appreciated their professionalism and their courtesy. Would definitely go back.</body>

        <body>Food was awesome as always.  Service was good, my only complaint is why, if you have a 5:45pm reservation for 2, does it take until 6:30 pm to be seated.  If I wanted a 6:30 reservation I would have made one.  Poor time management on their part for estimating reservations.  Quit overbooking your location and shoving people 3 deep up to the bar</body>

        <body>Reservations required or a long wait.  Noisy and crowded with people standing around waiting for tables. Food is well prepared and mostly delicious but the portion size is small for the high price especially the steaks. All food is ala carte.  For the 3 of us- with a couple of drinks (no wine), steak, seafood came too $300 with tip. Service was very good and there was no rush to eat and leave but this restaurant is not our first choice for a pleasant dining experience.</body>

My wife had the Surf and Turf and just loved the Lobster and remarked that the drawn butter was the best she&apos;d had. She regretted going medium well on the fillet, but it was good.  I had the Cowboy Rib eye and it was perfect! The beef was well aged and had a very good flavor. The chef hit medium well right on target and the steak was everything I could ask for. All in all, a great experience.</body>

        <body>The food was phenomenal, I was not thrilled about waiting 45 minutes past my reservation time of 6:15, a reservation I had made over 9 days prior to my visit.  And then we were seated at a table big enough for 1 in a corner and there was two of us, had to lift my drinks up every time a plate was brought to us so we could make a little room. These are all first world problem&apos;s but the bill was over 150 dollars so I&apos;d expect more of an experience.  The food again was great and cooked to perfection but service and overall experience was sub par.</body>

        <body>I had the privilege of hosting eight for Easter Sunday brunch at Pittsburgh Blue in Maple Grove.  The bartender on duty, Brendon, made a great round of cocktails for us as we waited for our table,  and we were seated right on time.  The buffet was great, especially the shrimp cocktail and prime rib though I would expect nothing less from PB.  The highlight was the eggs Benedict on homemade English muffins...they stole the show!   The main buffet could have used a little more attention to refills, and the dessert bar had only two choices, but other than that we were well pleased.  Our server was engaging and anticipated our needs before we ever thought to ask for anything.    We will be back for regular Sunday brunch now that we have experienced Pittsburgh Blue on a Sunday morning.</body>

        <body>The food was awesome. The hashbrowns with blue cheese were a favorite of the group. The steaks and crab were full of flavor. The french fries with their special sauce were a great appetizer. We cannot say enough about this restaurant. To top it off the service was impeccable. The service was knowledgeable of the menu and provided great recommendations.</body>

        <body>My girlfriend and I went to Pittsburgh Blue Wednesday night for dinner after we both got off work and I knew it was an upscale restaurant so I made a reservation for 7p.m. We should up about 10 minutes prior and the place was packed! They said it would take a few minutes for a table to clear which was understandable our reservation was at 7 and we were early so they gave us a buzzer.  About 20 minutes went buy and it was now 7:10 or so and we still weren&apos;t called up so I was a little curious. I&apos;m a pretty patient guy so I waited and just thought they were busy. Then I started noticing people that came in after us get seated before us so I decided to say something. The hostess felt horrible she actually tried buzzing us a few times but our buzzer was not working. I was okay with it because I am somewhat technological and understand technology fails.  However, Nick, who was the manager that evening came over right away and apologized for the inconvenience offered us a free appetizer. He</body>

        <body>AT the outset, the ambiance was enjoyable. The service was attentive and helpfully informative. The menu is impressive. The wedge salad was very good; large enough for two to share, but not that unusual. The main course arrived only warm, the steak overdone to my liking. They quickly exchanged it for an excellent piece of meat, perfectly done and hot! By then, my partner was nearly through his meal. I suggested to the manager, who was quite solicitous, that they use covers for their plates. One of the biggest disappointments was the crab cake! It was likely the worst I&apos;ve ever had or made myself!!  The best part of the meal was the unexpectedly delightful Shiraz I ordered, only because of the odd name! By then I had already sampled 2 others which were disappointing. in spite of the rave reviews of our waiter! I wondered if some of the effort of the wait staff was to encourage patrons to purchase the more expensive varietals, which this was not.  If the food had arrived as I had antici</body>

        <body>The food and the service at the table was excellent - no issues or complaints.  The problems were prior to being seated.  We had reservations for 6:45 but were not seated until nearly 7:30.  There is not much of a waiting area for a restauant that should know it will have patrons waiting - just room to stand in the door area.  No service while waiting unless you go to the bar yourself.  No updates from the host stand unless we asked.  We did receive apologies and complimentary appetizer once seated, as well as an apology from the manager, which is a nice effort.  Overall,  a good experience, but the restauant needs to find a way to welcome the patrons from the moment they walk in the door.</body>

        <body>This was our first time dining at Pittsburgh Blue. Unfortunately, both my order and my husband&apos;s order came out wrong. We didn&apos;t realize his order was wrong until my order came back for the second time, which meant that his food got cold while waiting for my order to get fixed and then my food got cold while waiting for his order to get fixed. Additionally, my husband&apos;s drink sat empty on several occasions. We weren&apos;t offered any compensation for the order mix-ups. For the price, the food and service were sub par. I don&apos;t think we will return.</body>

        <body>The Easter Brunch was $29.95 per person and the price did not include any beverage options such as coffee, tea or orange juice only water.  The food selections  were not that many and the buffet tables  were crammed in a very small space making it difficult to where some of the food options were located.  Do not plan on returning.</body>

        <body>Pistachio crusted walleye...even the phrase sounds delicious, and it was! Service was superb. The glasses were never empty and the server gave us info on dishes we saw zooming by. Defintely worth a repeat visit.</body>

        <body>We had a $100 gift card, which was very nice. Normally we couldn&apos;t afford to go to a place like this without it. It is expensive, but as long as you know that going in- you will not be disappointed. My wife and I agreed it was the best meal we&apos;ve ever had at a restaurant. The steak was unbelievable., and the wine was great too. I&apos;d definitely recommend you go, if you have the money or for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>The food is over priced. I had a fillet minion. It was average and over priced. Nothing comes with the steak. I have gotten a better steak at Texas road house for less than half the price. The service was great. Wish I could remember our server&apos;s name. The booth was nice because we sat next to each other instead of across from each other. It was loud in the restaurant. We were near the kitchen so all the food was being rolled by us. I do not think I will go back there.</body>

        <body>We were seated in an overflow (party) room.  It felt more like an Outback Steakhouse or Timberlodge.  It took a while once we were seated for our server to come to our table.  She did apologize.  The food was good but the service and atmosphere were disappointing.  There are so many options in the area, we probably won&apos;t be back.</body>

        <body>I made a reservation for my boyfriend&apos;s birthday a month prior. Apparently reservations don&apos;t mean much here as there was still a 15-20 minute wait.   Once seated, underneath our table was really dirty. Something was stuck under the table and fell into my lap. Plus there were croutons or something that kept crunching under my feet all throughout the meal. It was kind of gross.  The steaks were phenomenal and cooked to perfection. Just a heads up that if you do not like spicy food, steer clear of the onion rings and the grown-up mac and cheese. Another tip is that even though it is your birthday you still have to pay for that dessert with the pretty sparkler. No freebies here!  The wait staff was friendly and really nice, but for as much money as you pay to eat here I would’ve expected better.</body>

        <body>The staff was great, and the service was impressive, but the brunch included only a meager selection of items, heavy on the breakfast side.  We always go out for holiday brunches, and this was the least impressive and not worth the cost.</body>

        <body>We were seated at a middle table of a long booth seat on one side with chairs on the other.  As shortly after sitting the woman to the right of my wife began to talk to her male partner across from her with the most distinct loud annoying voice. She did not cease for almost an hour until she left. The person to my wife&apos;s left although well meaning was listening to our conversation and interjecting her recommendations to us. The restraunt is set up with booths on perimeter of the room and tables in the center which is probably typical to cram the most people in. The steak was delicious, staff friendly but seating was more like a cheap buffet than a high priced steak house.  Their motto is &quot;Good steak isn&apos;t cheap&quot; but their seating is.  We will not be back. It&apos;s also nice if you they actually give you all the food they offer to box up for you to take home.</body>

        <body>The walleye sandwich was not good. Almost no flavor in the fillet. The bun was cold and a little soggy. The walleye filet also was not crisp at all. With the bun being a little soggy, the filet just mashed itself apart.  I had to pick most of it up off my plate after it fell off the bun.  The tortilla soup I had with lunch was very good.</body>

        <body>Our evening started out great with a perfect Booth over looking the dining room. I ordered in flowers that were placed at the table before we arrived. Clancy (our waiter) was about as perfect a waiter you could ask for and the food was spectacular. Thanks for a very memorable Valentines dinner!! See you all soon :)</body>

        <body>The restaurant has great food, great service, but alittle noisy, the tables are really close together so you don&apos;t get the quiet dining experience or romantic atmosphere for the money you pay for the food.</body>

        <body>Last 2 times we have been there we have had to return a food item ot 2 for being under or over cooked.  I realize it happens from time to time.  Last time the manager was rude about it.  For the price paid would expect better.</body>

        <body>My husband &amp; I do not get out very often because of having small kids, but when we do get a date nite we ALWAYS pick this restaurant!  Its so romantic and the food is beyond excellent!! We always say we will try somewhere new - but just cannot because this place is just great &amp; cannot be beat!  We have never once been disappointed.  The scallops appetizer is to die for.  I would love to shake the hand of the person who thought that up :)  Its the best tasting thing I&apos;ve ever eaten.  My husband got the cowboy ribeye (best steak u could ever eat) and I had the horseradish crusted salmon. Both were EXCELLENT.  They also serve the most wonderful strawberry cheesecake!  The servers are always wonderful!  You will not be disappointed here.  Great job Pittsburgh blue!! We will be back soon :)</body>

        <body>The service was amazing. Our server was very knowledgable and always checked in on us. The food was outstanding. One of the best steaks I have ever had. My wife is pregnant and we had to get hers well done. It was just as flavorful and tender as my steak. This was our first time there and planning on returning.</body>

        <body>From the moment we arrived everything was perfect. The service was five star from our waiter. We were never rushed or hurried in any way.(remember this was Valentines Day) The manager even stopped to chat a bit. The food was excellent and prepared perfectly. Honestly I cannot say enough good things about this evening at Pittsburg Blue.</body>

        <body>Made a reservation and made it there with 10 min to spare, didn&apos;t get seated until 15 mins after our reservation time, what&apos;s the point of making them if people that walk in get seated before us! Get seated nobody came by for about 15 mins to take drink order, then took about another 15 to 20 min to get our food ordered. She never came back to check on us but was checking on all of her other tables, which pissed me off. Food was awesome but service sucked !</body>

        <body>First I would like to say that I have dined here several times.  I will say that bad business decisions have made this a very average experience.  I will sum this up in a very short way.  I come to Pittsburgh Blue knowing full well my wallet will be emptied and this is a choice anyone makes when they dine at a fine restaurant.  I am upset because the size of the steaks has dwindled to the point that I feel I am eating a breakfast steak.  Now I understand that the price of meat has soared, but I would much rather a restaurant of this caliber increase the price rather then keep their price point and cut the proportions.  I have always enjoyed telling friends what a wonderful meal you can get at Pittsburgh Blue, but expect to pay a good price.  Now I can tell my friends that is is not only expensive, but the meal is half of what it use to be.  PLEASE Pittsburgh Blue,  bring back your larger meals and raise the price!  I am willing to pay for quality!</body>

        <body>I took my friend to Pittsburgh Blue for a special birthday dinner. Food was excellent, service was very good but the dining room was quite noisy. I&apos;d recommend this place to others for special occasions only because it is somewhat pricey $120 for 2 (food only) and everything is ala Carte. Nice little complimentary red forest cake for dessert.</body>

        <body>Pittsburg Blue is what you expect from a top notch steak house.  Casual fun atmosphere and a very nice steak prepared exactly the way you want it.  The Rib Eye was fabulous, along with the Blue hash browns and a very good wine list.  We had excellent service, our dinner arrived promptly and everything was as it should be. My wife and I had a truly enjoyable evening and we will be looking forward to coming back again.</body>

        <body>I was wary going in reading the reviews about Pittsburgh Blue.  However, the service was good tonight.  We were directed to the favourites and were helped with the wine menu after some lengthy deliberations.   The food was disappointing though.  We started with the maple glazed bacon (which to be fair was really good, but was fattier than it should have been).  The Mac n cheese &amp; broccoli was amateur at best.  The broccoli looks like it was picked up from the grocery store and steamed, there was huge stalks!  The mac was bland!  The steak was not good.  There was no seat to it, an abundance of fat (not marbling, but hunks of fat!), and was underdone.  I really wanted to like this place &amp; ignore other negative reviews but now I understand. I hope this helps others</body>

        <body>I took my boyfriend there (first time for him) for his Birthday.  I made reservations and mentioned it was for his birthday.  Throughout the night, from the moment we walked in, to leaving... they made us feel welcomed and recognized his birthday.   He loves steak and his favorite restaurant has always been Mannys for the steak.  I&apos;m a big fan of fish. We asked for recommendations and our server was super knowledgable.  We were not disappointed. He loved his steak.. said it is BETTER than Mannys.  I ordered the SeaBass. OMG -the best ever.  We had side hashbrowns &amp; asparagus.. both yummy!   And cheesecake for dessert!  The food is awesome. The service is the best!  Our server&apos;s name was Jennifer D.  She was super cool!  Prior to this, I have been there in the past for happy hour (drinks and apps on the patio).  Great patio.</body>

        <body>We ordered cowbye ribeye, mashed potatoes and squash.  one steak was rare, the other medium rare, although we both ordered medium.  We were in a hurry so just ate a little bit and took the rest home.  Both my husband and i got ill after lunch.  We figured it was just due to raw steak.  Since we paid $150 for the meal, we still heated it all for dinner, cooking the steak to medium, and still got sick afterwards.  Needless to say we will not be recommending or returning after getting food poisoning.</body>

        <body>The food was great as always. Service was good. The bill can get very pricey in a hurry. Not some where we go often but great for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>Went on Christmas Eve as a special occasion.  It was very busy (as expected) but also very loud and a number of screaming kids for the first 30-40 minutes, which was a surprise.  We were seated promptly per our reservation and the service was very good.    The bread was hot and very good!  While everyone should understand that this is an expensive venue, we did not find the quality of the steaks to be up to our expectation.  The steaks were prepared as requested (as medium and medium well) and but both were quite dry and not as tender as hoped for.  The prime rib was ordered as end cut but was served very pink, which is great if you were looking for medium-rare.  The sautéed mushrooms were ordered as a family serving and were the highlight of the meal.  Very tasty and cooked to perfection!  The baked potatoes were overcooked to the point that the inner potato had turned dark brown about 1/8th to 1/4 inch beyond the skin and was not edible (if you like the skins).  We ate the insides a</body>

        <body>We have enjoyed the bar many times so for a birthday dinner we chose to make a reservation for a full dinner ,3 weeks in advance.  Unfortunately , on a very cold MN evening and a very small foyer, even with a reservation we were forced to wait 30 minutes standing in the doorway for our reservation.  Additionally we were surrounded by others that were waiting for &gt;1.5 hours.  Dampens the festive mood right from the start.  Fortunately out waiter, Peter was delightful and the meal exquisite.</body>

        <body>Great experience.  Knowledge of waiter 5 stars... we met friends there. A bit pricy for their family of four.food great.  The temp in the dining area was very drafty... we were at table 43. The most annoying issue...was the constant asking if our plates etc.  One after another...wanting to know if we wanted stuff boxed or if we were done etc....it got old after the third time when we were still waiting for coffee and ice cream.  Unger the table turning...but it felt very rushing....and knowing we stayed in the servers section. We left over a 25% top two tickets for table 43.</body>

        <body>The meal was amazing and the waiter was great at recommending what to order and how - such as &apos;this steak is amazing but it is 22 oz so if you get it you could have it split&apos;.  He held a discussion about the ala&apos;carte options for potatoes and vegetables and he was spot on.   the two of us had a cowboy steak split, one order of hash browns, one order of asparagus and hollendaise sauce. We drank water only and had no dessert and the bill with 20% tip was $100.00.    This is not a place to go on the cheap and I don&apos;t think many could frequent the restaurant but for special occasions it is perfect.  We went because a client gifted us with a $100.00 gift card.  It will take another gift card to justify the expense but we totally look forward to that next opportunity.</body>

        <body>Our meal was very nice. The food is always good here. We had the fish specials, the halibut and the char. Both were tasty and well-prepared, as was the Caesar salad with soft boiled egg. The only thing about the restaurant that continues to bother me is the obnoxious noise level. Even sitting right next to each other it&apos;s difficult to have a conversation. I know that&apos;s a trend, but when you are spending that kind of money for a meal, it would be nice to be able to chat. What&apos;s strange is that the bar is always quieter.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been here 4 times prior to this visit and the food was always outstanding and worth every penny. Today three of us were celebrating V-Day and had the worst food ever. The steak while tender was good but nothing special but the lobster was not egible in anyway. The King Crab was okay but again nothing special and watering which was odd.  The aspargus was tough and the sauce was cold and thick as if it was sitting for hours.  The best part about dinner was the bread. Oh and the red velvet cupcake was disgusting, over baked and there is no excuse for that really? Without the strawberry sauce it was hardly worth eating. For $300 dollars I expect EXCEPTIONAL food and that didn&apos;t even come close to happening this time!  The three of us all went out again with a fourth person on Sunday to Red Lobster in Bloomington and had the most amazing food for $150.00... I won&apos;t be back to Pittsburg Blue for a very long time.</body>

        <body>nice for special occasion, but too much for my budget.   Service was excellent/outstanding.   Ambiance was a view of the kitchen. With many other open booths and ones marked with reserved signs questioned why my family was seated front row to the kitchen.</body>

        <body>The only positive was we were seated early. While we were waiting to be seated, my husband left to use the restroom and, of course, the buzzer went off. I was seated and the hostess said she would watch for my husband to direct him to the table. It never happened! my husband looked all over  and finally found me after circling for awhile. We were seated and told they were bringing bread. About 10 minutes passed and I finally asked for some. My spinach goat cheese salad would have been good except for over doused dressing. My husband ordered a wedge salad, which you have to cut up, the plate was so small and the salad kept coming off the plate. As we waited for our entrée, our server brought a cart right in front  of our table and proceeded to cut up the salads of the people sitting behind us. That was probably the rudist thing I&apos;ve ever seen at a restaurant. Stand at your customers table and cut THEIR salad. Then, the steaks were mediocre. Servers need better training. We will not ret</body>

        <body>Whenever we want a great steak we go to Pittsburgh Blue.  It is a bit pricey but the quality and portion size of the steak is great and you can split it along with all the sides.  The scallop appitizer is worth the trip in itself.  The service is excellent and the wait staff know their stuff.</body>

        <body>A very relaxing and delicious way to celebrate a birthday. Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable. When our ribeye steaks arrived, and that was quicker than expected, they were done exactly as each of us had ordered. My baked potato was enough for at least two people and the large side dish was more than enough for the three of us. We finished our meal with cheesecake which was more than we could finish. Though we tried.</body>

        <body>My husband and I found this place a few years ago and are so happy we did. We are huge seafood and steak fans and this place has perfected both! What makes this restaurant stand out is the amazing service. The waiters are very knowledgeable and know exactly how to treat their customers. From celebrating a special occasion to just wanting to enjoy a good quality meal this is the place for you!</body>

        <body>My wife&apos;s fillet mignon and mine were both ordered med rear, when they came they were charred  to the point of being crusted and dry. They killed this prime cut twice. When we told the waitress she told us you have to request how they are cooked.    I ordered these the same way I always do when I go there and they have never charred them like this. You just don&apos;t destroy a fillet like this. I am so fricken disappointed I will never return. I&apos;m paying over $150 for a meal they destroyed the whole meal by chafing the meat. I can&apos;t explain how bad these were. Everything else was fantastic but after this experience I am done. I will never return. So long amigos.</body>

        <body>This was our first time to this restaurant and we expected the food quality to be much better than it was because of the price. He ordered his steak medium and I ordered mine medium well but mine was just as pink inside as his was. The taste was okay but we were expecting delicious which it was not. We ordered the chocolate mousse cake for dessert and it did not impress us either. It was kind of dry. We expected it to be moist and delicious and it was not. We didn&apos;t like the huge side dishes which were too much to eat alone so had to be shared so we had to pick something we would both eat. However, to be fair, we can&apos;t really give an accurate review having been there only once because they could have been having an off day. We didn&apos;t have time to vocalize our views at the time. We do not plan to return though because we expected a delightful treat and were disappointed.</body>

        <body>Unfortunately, the food is way over priced for the quality... I made the terrible mistake of ordering lobster - I should&apos;ve known better - don&apos;t order seafood at a steak house because my lobster was so tough I had to cut it with the steak knife!!  Yikes!  It&apos;s was uneatable.   I was very disappointed... Plus, I had a very upset stomach after eating there ... If you know what I mean... So sad for a $200 dinner.  Definitely not going back !</body>

        <body>Great waiter, but the food was very lacking. Dry, hard chicken. Very loud. Not romantic, or quiet, or dark, or personable at all. Next table to us was RIGHT THERE !! Too pricey for what we got. The chicken wasn&apos;t enough to feed my tiny dog. Waiter did try to recover the night for us by taking the chicken off our bill and giving a bday treat. Very cold as door draft swept right into the back room behind the bar. Need a small wall or something by front door to block the draft. There won&apos;t be a next time for us.</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve eatten at Pittsburgh Blue for special occasions over the last few years, and normally have items off their steak menu. This time, we decided to try their sandwiches just to experience more of the menu.  I had the hamburger and added bacon and cheddar cheese, and i choose fries and a side salad to complete the meal. The salad wedge was huge and wonderful. The burger was flavorful and the side toppings were impressive. The tomatoe slices for the hamburger and salad were at least 1/2&quot; thick and 2.5-3&quot; diameter. My hubby had their tenderloin steak sandwich, which looked wonderful and he stated it tasted even better than it looked. It was my birthday dinner, and I had informed them when I made my reservation. We had our special dessert, which continues to be one of my favorite desserts. Absolutely fabulous! Staff and service were great, even on a busy night. We&apos;ll be back again!  Can&apos;t wait to see what we try next on the menu!</body>

        <body>We were in town for a long weekend trip to Charleston, for the first time. Poogan&apos;s Porch was recommended to us so I made a reservation for Saturday night. This restaurant is so charming, pretty and cozy. Our server, Jack, was phenomenal. The atmosphere and our table were perfect. The drinks and food were excellent. My husband and I both loved our meals and will definitely go back next time we&apos;re in Charleston. The entire experience was perfect for us!</body>

        <body>With their winter 2015 rollback price menu, the food at Poogan&apos;s Porch is the best value in all of Charleston.    Food is equal in quality to some of the best Charleston restaurants, but at nearly half the price.   Everything we ordered was excellent, and service was flawless.  Great menu choices, we would have gone for dinner there again and tried other entrees if we were staying another night in town...</body>

        <body>This restaurant had the best Mac n&apos; cheese I&apos;ve ever had. It&apos;s a grownup version made with Gouda and small bits of bacon and ham. It&apos;s &quot;to die for.&quot; This is a big tourist spot, so it&apos;s busy and noisy, but totally worth it.  Lots of celebrity photos appear on the walls.  When we were there, we had just missed Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively, who were going to be married in Charleston. If I ever visit Charleston again, I will definitely re-visit Poogan&apos;s Porch.  (Named for the owner&apos;s deceased dog who loved to sit on the porch.)</body>

        <body>First time at Poogans and it won&apos;t be the last.  Started out with Pimento Fritters with Green tomato jam, which were very good.  We had a large party, but some of the entrees were Cornmeal Fried Catfish, Ribs and Smoked Gouda mac n cheese, Fried Chicken and the Signature dish which was presented at the James Beard House in 2014, the Shellfish and Grits.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu as well as the wine list.</body>

        <body>We had been once before for lunch and that experience was average.  Recently, we went at night and were disappointed in our dining experience.  The shrimp and scallops were very bland.  It had a very small amount of sauce which rendered the dish very dry.  It would have been much improved if they had put much more sauce.  Will not be returning.  The service was good and the staff is very pleasant.</body>

        <body>I have food allergies and love and know fine food. This was a wonderful meal shared with family. The staff was knowledgable and went out of their way to accommodate me. Other restaurants make me eat salad while everyone else eats well. Not PP I had potatoes with asparagus and salmon. Cooked to perfect and presented beautifully. Great wine list!</body>

        <body>After spending considerable time choosing restaurants for our weekend in Charleston, we decided to try Poogan&apos;s Porch based on their menu and wine list. Although the food and drink were commendable, the experience was disappointing. This was the first time in many years of fine dining that we were not seated at our reserved time. Instead we were told that the &quot;table was not ready&quot; and sent to the bar area to wait. After seeing other patrons shunted into the bar as well and paying a $20 bar tab, we were finally escorted to our table. The room we were in had over a dozen tables, 5 of which were empty, and several of which stayed empty the entire time we were there. As only one party walked by us to leave during our time at the bar, I can only assume the trip through the bar is the house policy to increase liqour sales.  More disappointing was the wait staff. After finishing our first course, our server said she would bring fresh silverware and then realized she had not brought the custo</body>

        <body>I travel to Charleston several times a year for work. On this trip, I decided to try out Poogan&apos;s Porch with a work colleague. She ordered the vegetarian option and specified little/no oil. However, when her dish came out, it was drenched in olive oil. When she said something to the waiter, he began arguing with her that the included the least amount of oil possible. She tried to remove as much of the oil as she could, but still could not eat the dish. She requested more vegetables, and the waiter brought some asparagus. However, he did not offer to fix the original dish. She left with little food eaten and I was very disappointed with what is usually the city with the best service in the nation. I wll not be going back to the restaurant with so many great ones in the area.</body>

        <body>This charming restaurant was just across the street from our hotel, so it was especially convenient on a chilly night.  We enjoyed a beautiful evening of fine food and conversation at Poogan&apos;s Porch.  Our table was in a quiet,out of the way spot as I requested.  I sincerely appreciate this effort on the part of the management to honor this request.  Our server, Rosa, went out of her way to be unobtrusive yet at the same time extremely helpful.  I wish we lived near Charleston so that we could enjoy this lovely spot again and again.</body>

        <body>I choose Poogan&apos;s Porch for a dinner meeting with the bosses. Not only were the food and drinks excellent but the service could not have been better!!! They were friendly and extremely helpful with answering questions regarding their menu. I have Celiac Disease so it can be very difficult for me to eat out. They made it simple and I had the best salmon and risotto in my life!</body>

        <body>What a great restaurant on Queen St.  We passed this little  gem several times in the past and decided to try it.  Our table was ready right on time.  The server was knowledge and offered some recommendations based on my unique food sensitivities. I ordered the classic fried chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Wow!  This was some of the best fried chicken and gravy.  The biscuits were also melt in your mouth delicious.   My sister enjoyed her pork chop but the highlight of her meal was the mac and cheese.  The portions are huge.  We also ordered a salad plus fried green tomatoes as starters so neither of us could find room for dessert.</body>

        <body>The food and service at Poogan&apos;s was very very good.  The fried chicken and pork chop entrees were really excellent.  Our server Sebastian knew the preparation and ingredients in every entrée and was so descriptive he should be on Food Network. I highly recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>Restaurant is very nice, good atmosphere and décor, but this night service was slow and food was only par. I had fried chicken and whipped potatoes with green beans. Chicken was average, potatoes were stiff with no taste. My mom had ribs and mac and she enjoyed her meal. Were seated at 7:45pm ordered before 8pm did not get food till 8:30pm. I have dined at Poogan&apos;s before and always enjoyed it. I was disappointed, considering that the restaurant was not packed, the seemed to be no excuse for the food or the wait. Probably will not try again for awhile.</body>

        <body>Server was good about replacing my app with a cup of soup after I mentioned the bread in the previous app was so tough,I literally couldn&apos;t bite through it. She crab soup was delicious. Had flank steak which was cooked a little too much, but overall tasted good and the sauces they make with it are fabulous. Side was a cauliflower in another delicious sauce. Dessert was an excellent pecan pie.  Wife&apos;s experience was similar, but with Ribs.  Overall, solid downtown option.</body>

        <body>Poogan&apos;s is a favorite of mine in a city where it is hard to find bad food. The menu isn&apos;t huge but everything on it is prepared quite well. My personal favorite is the calabash style seafood platter. Peanut butter pie for dessert! The wine list has something for anyone as well with decent prices. The service is always top notch and friendly. Definitely would recommend checking out Poogan&apos;s but make sure to have reservations as they fill up quickly most nights of the week.</body>

        <body>Give this place a miss. Disappointing overall. The food was overly complicated and tasted reheated. Vital ingredients like sauces were missing from the menu and were an unwelcome surprise at the table. The restaurant was filled with large, loud groups. Upstairs was warm and stuffy.</body>

        <body>Poogan&apos;s Porch came highly recommend to my wife and I; now we know why. All facets of this restaurant evoke the feeling of dining in an ornately and tastefully (pun intended) decorated southern home.  The inside of the establishment is like taking a trip back into a different time with crackling fires in mantel wrapped fireplaces, classic southern styled interior, inviting home-like charm, tall ceilings, beautiful trim molding and painted plaster walls.   The food is remarkable in its simplicity. I ordered [and promptly finished] the braised beef short ribs with horseradish cauliflower mash and grilled carrots. The meat was so tender and moist that it felt like butter and tasted like heaven. The carrots added a satisfying crunch factor to compliment the soft beef and the cauliflower bound the plate together harmoniously with a subtle undertone of spice.   My wife ordered the salmon to similar fanfare and we both shared the last bites of her fish accordingly with smiles on our faces. I</body>

        <body>The catfish had little flavor, the flank steak was tough and the shrimp toast appetizer was difficult to eat as the bread was extremely tough.  We expected toast points instead of french bread.   The coffee was very good.</body>

        <body>We were lucky to experience five restaurants well in Charleston, booking for an advance. Poogan&apos;s was a last-minute add-on because we arrived a day early. We were tired and it was late but we were so hungry and heard great things about this restaurant! Unfortunately I have to say it was definitely our least favorite out of all the restaurants we ate at. My husband had the shrimp and grits and I had the braised short ribs. We shared that she crab soup just to taste it and our appetizers for the fried green tomatoes and the pimento fritters. We also had a few cocktails. The food was pretty good, but my brace short ribs portion was so small compared to the next night when my husband ordered it at another restaurant and it was about five times larger. The service was okay but we could tell that he was tired by the end of the night and not very helpful in ordering. The fried green tomatoes were just okay compared to the other places we tried them, same for the shrimp and grits. Glad we cam</body>

        <body>Delicious, well presented dishes. Almost to much to finish. Poogan&apos;s had his favorite wine and she liked her cocktail. Crab appetizer was good. He loved his mustard ribs. She loved her salmon with risotto.  The peanut butter pie was light and delicious. Our server was very skilled in attending to our needs.</body>

        <body>Sadly,  we will not be returning.  We have always enjoyed Roll-back menu and This year we brought our elderly parents.  We were seated in a cold draft. Our server forgot us. The food wasn&apos;t good, surprisingly. The portions were insulting lyrics tiny.  I was served 3 Bills Bay oysters on my entreě and they were the size of a nickel. I was very embarrassed in front of my parents. We cannot, in good faith, return to Poogan&apos;s Porch.</body>

        <body>My wife and I had an early dinner reservation at  5:30, and when arrived at 5:20 they sat us almost immediately.  The hostess was friendly, polite and pleasant, and the waiter was well informed, personable, and always near by when needed.  The drinks and food were served promptly and exactly as ordered.  The food from the salads, to the entrees, to the dessert was incredibly good.  It was a great meal at a reasonable price.  Definately a place to revisit and one to recommend.</body>

        <body>I needed a vegetarian option, which mentions they can prepare upon asking. I wanted an actual vegetable plate with a selection of individually prepared vegetables on one plate. I felt after considerable review options with the waiter this is what I would receive. After a long wait, at least 30-40 minutes, out came the entrees. I received what looked and tasted to me like stir fry. It was edible, but honestly just not that good. When the waiter came to collect our plates mine had half if not more  remaining. Not one question was asked. My other friends had sweet tea salmon and fried chicken. They both said their food was very good. So, if you need a vegetarian option be extremely specific as to what you want. I would even choose each specific vegetable and describe how you want it plated.</body>

        <body>Our experience was Very Good in that we both loved our meal and it capped off our first day into town with a comfort food experience that we needed after our late night Christmas meal with family the day before.  I had the fried chicken breast that practically melted in your mouth - it was so juicy and tender.  The portions were more than enough; however, I ate every bite...it was that tasty.  Our wait staff was constantly attentive.  We couldn&apos;t have asked for a better experience.</body>

        <body>This was our first time at Poogan &apos;s Porch.  It has gotten good reviews so we thought we would try it for Christmas.  When we arrived it was crowded...we had reservations but we were early so we would have to wait. We were able to get a cocktail in the bar while we waited.   We were seated only 5 minutes past our reservation time which was great.  We got a great table, plenty of room for 2 which we liked...sometimes restaurants put couples at these tiny tables lined up in a row.  The wait staff attended to us immediately for drink orders.  There was no rush and we were able to enjoy  a drink while looking at the menu.  The meal was fixed price that evening with traditional Christmas fare and their most requested meals ...$52 per person which included appetizers, entrée and desert.  We felt the price was very fair for the meal received.  The food was excellent and we were allowed to enjoy without feeling rushed.  All the employees were wonderful! I have to complement the restaurant for</body>

        <body>Visiting for business.   This was an excellent choice for dinner.  The food was good southern home cooking loaded with flavor but plated in a way thay rivals many fine dinning places i have been in the past.   The service was friendly without being intrusive.  The atmosphere was homey and elegant at the same time.  I even loved the choice in music.</body>

        <body>We had a lovely New Year&apos;s eve dinner at Poogan&apos;s Porch. It was my first visit in Charleston and coming from Finland, living in Denmark, I was looking forward to a special Southern experience. Me and my boyfriend certainly got it. Our evening was especially made perfect by our waiter, Jamie, I think, with a beard. I got an impression, that he was a local and with that gorgeous Southern accent he patiently explained all about the food. He was the best! I think we were the last ones at the restaurant but he wasn&apos;t hurrying us at all.  We had crab soup and mac n&apos; cheese for the starters, which were amazing, especially my mac n&apos; cheese, best one I&apos;ve ever had. For the min course we had duck and pork, both were tender and just perfect. Thank you for a lovely experience and a special thanks for Jamie for nailing it.</body>

        <body>This was my third time at Poogan&apos;s Porch and every time I think it cannot be better, it surpasses my expectations.  The biscuits (in lieu of a bread basket) are to die for - you will dream about them months later.  They will spoil you for all other biscuits.  She crab soup was spectacular, as were the pimento cheese fritters.  The fried chicken has earned its reputation as being among the best in the city.  A shrimp and linguine dish was also out of this world.  Try the Ice Pick cocktail (sweet tea vodka and lemonade) - one of the best I&apos;ve ever had.  Everything about Poogan&apos;s Porch is delightful.  It is my go-to place in Charleston, always.</body>

        <body>This was a fantastic meal for us after a day of touring downtown Charleston!  We had made reservations ahead of time using Open Table with ease and were seated right on time.  Our server, Aaron, was very knowledgeable about both the menu as well as the drinks.  It was great to try knew things.   I had the Ribs and Mac.  I swear it was the best mac and cheese I&apos;ve ever had, and I am an avid mac and cheese consumer.  My sister had the Shrimp and Grits, also amazing.  My mom had the Sweet Tea Glazed Salmon, also excellent.  We all had cornbread with honey butter to share.  We left pleasantly filled and with hopes of returning one day.</body>

        <body>Our party of six had a magnificent evening of food and ambiance at Poogans.  We ordered everything from the shrimp and grits to the duck and there was praise all around the table.  What a charming room we had.  The fireplace, wall coverings and old south charm added warmth to the chilly winter evening.  The attentive, but not hovering wait staff were courteous and helpful with suggestions.  Thank you, Stan from Franklin, TN</body>

        <body>We are locals and decided to try Poogans Porch for the first time! To say it was excellent would be an understatement. Everything from the atmosphere to the server was incredible!   Some of the group doesn&apos;t like to open up their range of palettes and be too adventurous, Poogans Porch provided a great array of food options and gave a small twist to the classic Recipes!   One me never of our group had to step out and take a phone call. At that exact moment, our food came. The server put his food back under the heat lamp until our friend came back. An exceptional offer which was greatly appreciated!   I will not only recommend this place time and time again, but I will be back for all dinner times!</body>

        <body>The best thing about Poogan&apos;s Porch was the cocktail list, which was fresh and imaginative. However, to get us into the bar, the staff pretended our table wasn&apos;t ready, yet when we were seated there were six empty tables that had been set. The food didn&apos;t stand up to the cocktails; all 4 dishes were just okay.  Poogan&apos;s Porch fell far short of other restaurants we tried in Charleston.</body>

        <body>The food, service and ambiance at PP were all excellent.  Duck with dumplings was wonderful as was an arugula salad and desserts of pecan pie and bread pudding.  Only complaint was food temperature despite a request that it be served extra-hot.  Oddly, when the food was returned to the kitchen and then a new plate brought to us, the dish was still only lukewarm.  The staff was very accommodating and we would still come back for the restaurant&apos;s many inviting qualities but it&apos;s a shame that the chef&apos;s fine cooking can&apos;t truly be appreciated when the food arrives tepid.</body>

        <body>We had a party of 9 and we were handle very well.  Food was good but for the $$$ could have been a bit more impressive menu.  It was very traditional.  Not at all handicap accessible, but we were seated on the 1st floor so only had to worry about the steps into the restaurant.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  We would return, if only to try the regular menu which looks fantastic!</body>

        <body>I enjoy bringing visitors to Poogan&apos;s because of the combination of Southern inspired dishes and charm of the old house in which the restaurant is in.  Although there is a parking garage on Queen street and an expensive private lot, I recommend parking in the public garage on Cumberland St.  Then you will have a beautiful walk along church street to queen st.  Also you will be in a good spot for exploring this historic area by foot.   Back to the food.  The biscuits are the best I have ever had.  Don&apos;t worry about the carbs for a sec. and have a bite as it will be worth it.   I make pimento cheese myself, but pimento cheese fritters are a unique item to try.  Shrimp and grits is a Charleston classic dish and is not anything like boiled shrimp tossed in grits.</body>

        <body>Because of the quality of both the food and the service, we thought Poogan&apos;s Porch was a much better experience and value than the other restaurants nearby.   The atmosphere was quiet and lent itself to quiet conversation.  We will definitely be back.</body>

        <body>The service was very good.  We had the nicest team serve us. We liked the fried green tomatoes ok, nothing to write home about.  The fish my husband ordered was so over cooked you could hardly cut it.  I had the scallop and shrimp with pimento grit cakes.  My scallops were great but my shrimp were over done.  Sub par food but fun staff so not a horrible night.</body>

        <body>My husband and I have always liked this restaurant so wanted to visit it again on this trip to Charleston - and it did not disappoint.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  I had a delicious modern twist on shrimp and grits called shellfish and grits.  It was shrimp and scallops with grit cakes and a light shellfish broth - yummy.  Unfortunately, we still haven&apos;t seen the ghost who resides here.  Maybe next time.</body>

        <body>Management was accommodating to our request for accessible seating. The wine and beer lists were large with a delightful variety from which to choose. The beet salad and she crab soup were superb. The shrimp and grits entree was tasty and generous with large shrimp.  The BBQ entree was well spiced with meat that fell off the bones. The sweet tea glaZed salmon was grilled to a tender and moist perfection with an astonishing piquant risotto.  The only disappointment was the lack of attention to requests for more hot water for tea. Not sure why the requests were ignored. Eventually, we had to leave for a concert, so an additional request was moot.</body>

        <body>We were visiting the historic downtown area and this was an excellent dinner. Our server Nick from Cleveland Ohio was perfect for helping sort the varied menu. Wine by the glass and good beer selections. Mac and Cheese and Duck were my choices and both were very tasty. My wife Debbie talked about this place for two days after we left the area. A must visit location in the downtown area.</body>

        <body>I would have given this restaurant a higher score, except that we were taken by surprise by a pre fixe menu on Christmas Day (I don&apos;t like surprises like these). I looked on the website and didn&apos;t see any mention of it. Maybe I should have called. Whatever. I was surprised. The food was yummy. Had the fried chicken breast. Excellent. Besides the wait for our table, it didn&apos;t feel like a holiday production line and we picked this restaurant because it was open in Christmas. Side note: many Charleston restaurants are open on Christmas Day.</body>

        <body>We were tourists in town on Christmas and this was one of the few recommended places open on the holiday. We made our reservation far in advance (many weeks) in order to have a place for dinner on Christmas. When we arrived, the place was full and we had to wait for about 20-30 minutes to be seated; there was no room at the bar or in the waiting area. We waited outside in the cold, on the porch.   We expected a prix fixe menu with limited choices, but were pleasantly surprised to find a wide range of choices (three &quot;typical&quot; holiday entrees and about 5 others). The food was decent to good. The service was efficient and correct.   The building is a historic place that is quite worn and needs to be cleaned up. The wall by our table was, frankly, filthy.   The upstairs dining area was pleasant with a fire in the fireplace and the clientele was in a positive holiday spirit. We appreciated having a place to go that day and having people willing to work on our behalf.</body>

        <body>4 of us went to Poogans this past week (on a Tuesday). We were seated quickly and well taken care of. The alligator and the oysters were delicious! My salmon was a little over glazed, but cooked well. The others loved the fried chicken and my husband thought his ribs were just ok (but loved his she-crab soup). Great food for the price!  My only complaint is that we were seated near the window on a cold night and, despite the fireplace in the room, we were all pretty chilly. I know it&apos;s a old home, but we were a little uncomfortable.  We will be back!</body>

        <body>We enjoyed a NYE dinner at Poogan&apos;s Porch and couldn&apos;t have been more pleased.  There was a nice bar area for waiting for your table.  Then we were escorted upstairs right on time to our table for 4 right next to a nice wood burning fire.   The lighting was perfect.  Low, warm, cozy and romantic if that was your wish.  They had a full menu plus specials for NYE and we all chose a variety.  No one in  our party was disappointed.  The food was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The service was excellent to go along with the food.  They had a reasonable wine list with some excellent choices to pair with the food.  Overall excellent experience.</body>

        <body>First, the superlatives- our waiter, Jimmy R. was excellent, as were the biscuits. The Bibb wedge salad, she crab soup,  oysters queen, fried oysters and mashed potatoes were quite good. Two of us were disappointed that the fried chicken cutlets were overcooked and dry, with way too much, thick breading. Four of us found the collard greens to be very salty. Given Charleston restaurant prices, those on the Poogan&apos;s Porch rollback to the 1978 menu are reasonable. However, on a percentage basis, in recent years many prices have been substantially increased.  For example, the she crab soup has increased from $2.99 in 2013 to $3.99, oysters queen from $3.95 in 2010 to $5.50, fried chicken from $7.75 in 2013 to $10.50, shrimp and sausage from $3.25 in 2010 to $5.25, fried oysters from $8.50 in 2013 to $9.50.  (Over time,  a number of items have, understandably, been dropped from this menu due to cost pressures.)  One can argue that what difference does a few dollars make here and there, but</body>

        <body>We got last minute reservations and we&apos;re thrilled with coming back 30 years later to the same charming,  quaint spot!  Food was delicious, server was outstanding  and ambiance was warm and inviting.  There was a bit of draft from a chilly night.  Everything was wonderful‼️</body>

        <body>Best meal and Restaurant in Charleston! If you don&apos;t stop here, your trip to Charleston was not complete or half as good as it could&apos;ve been if you had stopped to eat here! The pimento cheese fritters are to DIE for! A Southerners dream! The Bibb lettuce salad was so fresh and tasty and the cast iron pork chop....no words...it was fabulous!</body>

        <body>Friends recommended Poogan&apos;s and thank goodness they did. Ice Pick cocktails were perfect after hours of walking Charleston.... I had the duck and my Husband had the fried chicken.  Both were outstanding - we will definitely be back!</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve lived here for 30 years, but avoided Poogan&apos;s because I assumed it was &quot;tourist food.&quot; Small portions, reheated, etc. Quite the opposite. The food quality was excellent. &quot;Mom &amp; Pop&quot; size portions. The pre-meal bread offering was a basket of fresh made warm and flaky biscuits. The table had a fish, a steak, and a pork chop. The beef was a bit under cooked for our taste. The fish and pork were perfectly prepared. All three entrees were nicely plated. The pre-meal bread offering was a basket of fresh made warm and flaky biscuits. Service was first class yet friendly. Made us feel &quot;at home.&quot; You will be proud to take family and friends to Poogan&apos;s. A bit pricy, but the experience was worth every penny.</body>

        <body>We had an excellent time for dinner at Poogan&apos;s Porch.  The waiter was attentive and helpful, wine list extensive but not overly pricey, and the food was great!  I&apos;m a vegetarian and the waiter said the chef was very accommodating.  My veggie pasta was very good and my husband really liked the short ribs.  What made the visit very special though was our seating on the upstairs deck overlooking Queen Street below.  Absolutely perfect!</body>

        <body>On a ladies&apos; getaway, we had dinner here.  The biscuits were as delicious as everyone said they were - and then some!  Our server was very good, pleasant and knowledgeable.  However, the food - although good - did not compare to  some of the other restaurants we ate at in Charleston.  Probably a better spot for lunch.</body>

        <body>We ate at Poogan&apos;s Porch on our honeymoon, enjoying delicious scallops and being treated to great service.  Likewise, our 25th anniversary meal was special .  My fried gneen tomatoes and grouper were perfect, and my husband loved the tender ribs with gouda macaroni and cheese.  Attentive server, warm ambiance, and tasty cuisine!</body>

        <body>We made reservations on the suggestion of our tour guide. During restaurant week they have a set menu of three courses with multiple choices. I sampled the roasted winter veg. Salad and my wife had the roast beets. The fried chicken was awesome and the ribs were smoky and tender. My Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese was great.  Would go,again in a heartbeat. Server was fast, friendly and knew her menu.</body>

        <body>When planning our trip to Charleston, my husband and I read the reviews for Poogan&apos;s Poorch and decided to make a reservation.  Glad we did!  The food was delicious and the portions were a good size.  We had great service from start to finish and really enjoyed the atmosphere of the old house turned restaurant.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend!</body>

        <body>Started with pimiento cheese fritters--so so good; it&apos;s served with a green tomato jam so the contrast of sweet and salty is awesome! I had shellfish &amp; grits entree which was amazing. Husband had pork chops which he said were good too. Great food! Good service. Definitely go.</body>

        <body>We enjoyed our meal and would probably come back. The food was good, but I guess we expected a little more. It was fresh and well prepared. I would describe it as elevated comfort food. The highlight for me was the appetizer of fried pimento cheese, but how can you go wrong with fried cheese. The service was great and I loved the atmosphere and the building.  Was a pleasant eating experience.</body>

        <body>We once again visited for the delicious seafood - scallops with pimento cheese ravioli and sweet tea glazed salmon.  We also enjoyed the delicious biscuits - flaky and hot from the oven.  The staff were friendly and very attentive.</body>

        <body>This restaurant is located in downtown Charleston and is one of the places that is highly recommended visiting.  Although the location and the restaurant are quaint, the food is just average.  So if you are looking for great food and you are a foodie, this is not the place for you.  It is a least a one time stop, but not a place you would return to over and over again.</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been coming to Poogan&apos;s porch for 8 years now on a recommendation from a hotel front desk clerk. We used to just come when we visited Charleston, but now that we&apos;ve moved here we not only come all the time but recommend it to our friends/family/visitors as well. We come with our child, but he is very well behaved. I cringe when others bring not so well behaved kids. The kids menu isn&apos;t very large which is fine by us, as our child eats off the adult menu/shares our plates. The ambiance is fabulous, the staff is wonderful and the food is always impeccably made and consistently awesome!</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been to Poogan&apos;s before and last time was a bit more enjoyable than this time.  Food was great but portions seemed to shrink.  Also, the air temperature was much colder than it should have been.  That was distracting throughout dinner.  Too bad, love this place otherwise!</body>

        <body>We were seated upstairs, the room is way too bright. The décor isn&apos;t great. The stacked chairs in the hallway gives the feel you&apos;re dining in the attic. Also walking up to the restaurant a ladder was in the front window gave the appearance it was under renovations. It&apos;s all in the details. Service very good- food average.</body>

        <body>Poogan&apos;s is my favorite place to eat downtown.  The fried chicken and mac and cheese are delicious!!  They also have amazing butter!!!  You definitely have to eat here!   If you can&apos;t make dinner, hit up poogan&apos;s for brunch.  They have excellent french toast and chicken and waffles.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve eaten at Poogans Porch probably 50 times in the past 3 years that I&apos;ve lived in Charleston. Yes, that is a lot of times.. but if you&apos;ve ever eaten at Poogans Porch than you would want to eat there as much as possible too! (Especially since I&apos;ve been walking distance the entire time!)  I&apos;ve been to Sunday brunch, had cocktails on the patio, met up with groups of friends for dinner, had &quot;Roll Back week&quot; with multiple different friend groups, grabbed dinner quickly at the community table, and the night my fiance asked me to marry him we had reservations at Poogans.. Which we were greeted with complimentary champagne and a toast!   From the quality of the food to the service of the waiters and waitresses Poogans Porch will always be my all time Charleston favorite. I love the vibe of the restaurant with local art from Lullie Wallace and Blakley Made to being able to accommodate big groups of parties, and even have fire places on during the winter. Poogans is simply stunning.  It&apos;s ex</body>

        <body>We had visitors from off who had asked for typical southern food. Poogan&apos;s Porch fits that bill perfectly. Service as always was all one could expect and our visitors were pleased with the choice. One of our guests is vegetarian and his needs were filled quite nicely. Our other guest wanted to try alligator and it was a big hit. Poogan&apos;s (the dog) story is a nice touch.</body>

        <body>We were visiting Charleston for the weekend, and decided to try Poogan&apos;s Porch because it was close to our hotel and has a long history in Charleston. Our food was excellent, especially the alligator salad and fried oysters. My mother was a little surprised that the restaurant didn&apos;t have white table clothes, which didn&apos;t bother me much, but would probably help to make the atmosphere a bit more formal for dinner. Our service was good since our waitress gave us some good recommendations from the menu, was very pleasant, and even brought us an extra scoop of ice cream with our dessert. However, she initially messed up my mother&apos;s dinner order and we had to wait while the dish was prepared, and then when the check came she overcharged my card, though thankfully the correct balance showed up on my credit card bill. I understand it happens, but it would have made the night a bit nicer without the hiccups. Still, I would definitely return and recommend Poogan&apos;s Porch to others.</body>

        <body>the mac n cheese was awful. Looked like easy mac with some bacon thrown on top.  It appeared to be something wrong with the heating because the bar area was extremely cold. Everything else I had during our visit was wonderful.  I highly recommend putting the flank steak on the menu!</body>

        <body>The restaurant was really nice in a quaint little building in the Historic section of Charleston. We sat indoors at a table for 2 in front of a fireplace. You could also eat outside in close proximity to Poogan, if you choose. Ask any waiter about Poogan. The young male waiter was laid back, friendly, and knowledgeable, making good suggestions on food and drink choices. We had dishes of fried catfish, which was nicely cooked and plentiful, with black eyed peas and collard greens, The other dish was broiled scallops, muscles, and hush puppies, over salad greens and tomatoes. Dessert was pecan pie with vanilla ice cream. Excellent! Everything was authentic southern cooking. Considering the quantity and quality of the food, the prices are more than reasonable. Poogan&apos;s Porch is definitely worth a visit when in Charleston, SC.</body>

        <body>Good service good cocktails - pork chop excellent but shrimp &amp; grits oddly sweet - sent it back - bit of a &quot;hit or miss&quot; situation with the menu.</body>

        <body>Welcoming fire on a cold night, candlelight.....celebrating 45 years with my husband. Add buttermilk fried chicken, collard greens cooked perfectly, couldn&apos;t be much better. But that Mac &amp; Cheese, a rich, creamy, cheesy dish of perfection. Love the little bites of country ham tucked in. My granddaughter asked if we could get the recipe. Thanks Poogans, as a local, I am happy to tell anyone that asks where to dine in Charleston - Poogan&apos;s Porch!</body>

        <body>We had an early dinner at Poogan&apos;s during Restaurant Week.  Overall, it was an  excellent experience.  We were early and had a drink at the uncrowded bar.  We were seated and the menu was explained to us by an engaging and attentive server who provided some history about the lovely historic home the restaurant occupies, including the ghost of Zoe who haunts the place.  Our appetizer was shrimp on toast; the shrimp were tasty but the bread was exceptional.  Our entrees arrived - catfish and scallops.  The seafood really shone - perfectly cooked scallops and the best fried fish either of us had ever tasted - crispy exterior with an incredibly-light interior.  Dessert was bourbon pecan pie which was OK.  The wines we tasted were nothing to write home about but the service and the main courses really were exemplary.  We did not have a Zoe sighting but perhaps next time we are in town . . . after all, we WILL be back.</body>

        <body>I just wished when they confirmed my reservation they would have told me they were doing a different menu for Xmas day. Was very pleasant atmosphere, very nice servers (other than tattoos showing) &amp; food was good. Decor was beautiful, seating was comfortable and presentation was appropriate. Historic pictures lining the halls was a nice to review while waiting for our reserved seating.</body>

        <body>Haven&apos;t been for dinner in a long time and glad we did.  The two key ingredients (food and service) were excellent.  A noisy party nearby hurt the experience but there are lots of people who aren&apos;t considerate of others. We will be back sooner than we have been.</body>

        <body>I have been coming here for almost 30 years. I don&apos;t get to go very often but when I am in Charleston I always make it a priority to eat here. This was a place that my mother loved - and rightfully so! They have some of the best she-crab soup around! This time I had the pan fried pork chop with country gravy &amp; their smoked gouda mac n&apos; cheese. The pork chop had wonderful flavor but could have been cooked a little less time. The mac n&apos; cheese was incredible!!! As far as the kids menu goes you cannot beat their chicken fingers - from a kid&apos;s and adult&apos;s perspective. They are some of the most tender and flavorful chicken fingers I have ever had!</body>

        <body>Overall: ehhhhhh. There were good and bad things here, but the overall experience was underwhelming; a let down. Best part of the night, BY FAR, was our server, JACK. Jack knocked it out of the park! Best server I&apos;ve had in years, actually. He was super friendly and very quick and attentive. He was also very knowledgeable of the menu, Charleston history, other local hot spots, favorite hang-outs, etc.   The outside seating is pretty cool and homey - definitely seemed like a great place to eat. Unfortunately, a little too chilly on this particular night. The inside, more specifically the bar area, had an odd smell and reminded me of yer great aunt Lucy&apos;s house (not a good thing). The inside/decor was exactly like you would except - an old southern home that is a restaurant.  The bar, was BAD!  The bar service was awful. I wish I could separate this from the overall restaurant review, since we had a drink while waiting for our reservation, but oh well. Beer selection was well below aver</body>

        <body>Got a coveted reservation for Poogan&apos;s rollback menu, when they offer their most beloved dishes at prices from 1978. Literally. And the quality and quantity don&apos;t suffer - neither did the service. Shrimp and grits were perfect as always, and my daughter gobbled up her tender ribs and mac. What a nice thing Poogan&apos;s does for a ten days to offer this, when they are so popular they really don&apos;t have to.</body>

        <body>My husband and I chose to go to Poogans Porch for my birthday dinner. We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation time and were seated quickly. We were given a cozy table right in front of the fire place, which was perfect for the occasion. Our waiter was friendly and funny, and even gave me a dessert as a birthday gift. All in all I was very happy with our dinner, and will definitely be going back soon!</body>

So many amazing things to choose. We sat in the bar for a relaxing drink before dinner and all the plates walked by us making our decision more difficult with every visual walk by. We will definitely be back!</body>

        <body>Those biscuits!!!!  They are eyes-rolling-in-the-back-of-your-head good.  And that&apos;s just the start. I had the Calabash shrimp and oysters and I will say it was one of the best meals I have ever eaten.  I have tried quite a few restaurants in Charleston while visiting my child at CofC and Poogan&apos;s Porch may very well be my favorite.</body>

        <body>Our server was personable and helpful; I appreciated her recommendations. I had delicious fried chicken, and my husband liked the Carolina BBQ ribs. Sides we enjoyed were mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and Mac and cheese; green beans were not entirely to our taste. There were many interesting choices on the menu for more adventurous diners. The room in which we were seated featured an attractive fireplace and decoratively-painted walks; it was quite attractive and comfortable. Prices were a bit higher than we expected, but were reasonable.</body>

        <body>The chairs was very unglued at the joins and I felt like it might break at any moment. Other than that everything was excellent... We have been dining here for years and the food is consistently top quality</body>

        <body>Wish we had tried the restaurant on a regular nite and not Christmas day.  It was too busy and not as pleasant as I think it would be otherwise.  The food was good overall, except for my husbands duck which was tough.</body>

        <body>We found Poogan&apos;s Porch via yelp, and we are THRILLED that we did. Turns out, it&apos;s one of the oldest restaurants in Charleston and popular with the locals. Well, these tourists loved it too! There was nothing that we ordered that I wouldn&apos;t order again. The fried green tomatoes were delicious and flavorful. We got the ribs (which were amazing, and came with yummy mac and cheese and brussel sprouts) and a sweet tea glaze salmon with a lemon/mint risotto and asparagus. YUM!</body>

        <body>Poogan&apos;s Porch as always, a most wonderful treat! The food was excellent, the service, excellent, and the ambience very quaint. We celebrated our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised with a complementary glass of champagne to start our evening with! Thank you to everyone at Poogan&apos;s Porch for helping us celebrate fourteen years together!</body>

        <body>We came across this restaurant by chance while walking thru the Charleston neighborhood.  A long guest line is always a great indication of excellence!  And, it proved true!  Unfortunately, The hostess could not accommodate us till 9:30 pm with a reservation. But, I gave a try on my iPhone app and...thanks to &quot;Open Table&quot; there was a spot available within 30 minutes.  We had a wonderful cocktail at the bar and then sat down to a delicious meal. The restaurant was offering a special &quot;throw back&quot; menu with retro entrees at retro prices... Boy did we hit on a lucky find!  Great Dining!  Great Night!  I highly recommend!</body>

        <body>Fair, just barely, is the best to be said. If you know how to cook or know what good cooking is, this is not the place to go. The only saving grace was a very good waiter. Food was not good. She crab bisque was flour paste, don&apos;t bother with it. Rest of food was just ok. Our waiter was attentive and responsive.</body>

        <body>Robert is a modern American restaurant housed within the Museum of Arts and Design with an amazing view of Columbus Circle and Central Park. Enjoy dinner and a bottle of fine wine from our collection in our beautifully designed dining room.  Have a seat in our lounge next to our baby grand piano and sip one of our cocktails.</body>

        <body>Disappointed in the numerous reviews highlighting  the great views from this restaurant - I would not go back to Robert because of the views. I would also not go back because of the overpriced nothing special cocktails.  However,  I would DEFINITELY Go BACK because of  the food and service.  Each of our selections were excellently prepared and delicious: Appetizers - Mussels, and Salmon Tartare Entree - Gnocchi  and the Branzino.  Service was attentive and polite.   I will go back!!!!</body>

        <body>One of the TEN BEST views in the World.  It is true!  Overlooks Columbus Circle with views of Broadway and the entire Central Park.  It is a little hard to find but it is located above the Museum of Arts &amp; Design. The design is modern and the food and service is worth every penny. Make reservations and have a special night out.</body>

        <body>This restaurant really pays attention to you. Since Tuna appetizer was not available, they gave complimentary hummus for appetizer. Then the kids fell asleep, so they wrapped the chicken to-go in 2 containers for us. Finally, they sent complimentary sweets for us and a candle to blow for the birthday.</body>

        <body>Amazing food, one of the best meals I have eaten in NYC in a long time. Great service, ambience and beautiful views. It was a relaxing birthday meal with good friends. The staff were so welcoming, the atmosphere of the restaurant super relaxing and the food was DELICIOUS- really fantastic night. I live in the neighbourhood and have seen the restaurant many time but for some reason it&apos;s taken me a long time to dine here, and now I can&apos;t wait to go back. My friends and I have been talking about the food every day since! I had the Goats cheese and papaya salad, scallops and braised lamb- then we shared 3 desserts. EVERYTHING was delicious.</body>

        <body>Food was ok. Girlfriend enjoyed her grilled octopus a lot, but I was not impressed with my seafood in coconut curry. Not really worth the price. Service felt a bit stiff and snobby. The hosts were friendly but it did feel like we were getting rushed through our meal. Not super appreciated. The interior decor is reminiscent of a bad porno. Modern art sure, but horrible dim yellow lighting. There weren&apos;t even real candles on the table, just these dim flickering yellow light bulbs. The saving grace of this restaurant is its view. Unfortunately it&apos;s not enough to convince me to come back here again.</body>

        <body>All the way from Denmark, we experienced a great service even from the booking stage. We celebrated our daugthers 18th birthday there, which is the same as the US 21st birthday. We requested a special seating for the event, which we got. Arriving at the restaurant was accomodated with a great service and the experience was complemented with appetizers on the house and a special Birthday dessert.  Outstanding service, food and location</body>

        <body>My second time and will not be my last. This is one of my favorite restaurants. It was my 2 year wedding anniversary and they gave us a tucked away window corner table with Columbus circle as the main view. Amazing food as always.</body>

        <body>we went with a group of 8. the view and design are really nice as well as service. during the brunch there was some live music. we were a bit away so ok for us but can be very noisy if just nearby. the food is good but nothing exceptional for a brunch, eggs and so on. classic but nice presentation. we chose because of the mix location / design and view and we were happy with the result. the menu is probably more interesting for dinner.</body>

        <body>Of the six nights we spent in NYC this trip, our best and more memorable dinner was at Robert.  Service was exceptional, the food was excellent, the view looking up Broadway and over Central Park was great, and overall we couldn&apos;t have asked for more.  One of us requires gluten-free meals and the restaurant was very accommodating.  And all this for a very reasonable price.</body>

        <body>The restaurant was recommended by the concierge at our hotel, and we went for Christmas Dinner; it was supposed to be special, and it was expensive!  The butternut squash soup was good, as was the pear salad.  But the duck and the dover sole were almost completely tasteless.  Worst we&apos;ve ever tasted.</body>

        <body>This is my third visit to Robert and each time I have been supremely pleased.   It&apos;s quite expensive, but totally worthwhile.   For this visit I took my family out for a pre-christmas dinner.  The view is always spectacular.  The ambiance was the best New York has to offer, with a live Piano in the background playing light Jazz, and the artistic decor.  The sommelier was very helpful in choosing a wine that fit everyone, but was not too pricey - - and he also brought my daughter a diet coke in a wine glass :-)    Food was interesting, well proportioned and tasted superb.  The wait staff had just the right touch of attentiveness.  All of us commented on the dinner, complementing the restaurant.  So, it remains my favorite place.</body>

This visit, I was hosting a woman at 2:30, and wasn&apos;t certain what she planned to eat. It turned out that she wanted cappuccino, so I joined her. Despite the fact that we did not order a meal, our server was absolutely accommodating and lovely. I so appreciated his demeanor. Watching the food served at there tables, I looked forward to my next meal there!</body>

        <body>Robert is a restaurant with a very clear point of view.  From the design and archetecture, to the menu and wine list, to our server&apos;s advice and opinions on various menu items we asked about.  It&apos;s a refreshing experiance to feel that you are in very capable hands Rober has been a long-time favorite of a dear friend in Manhattan, and it did not dissapoint when we finally gave it a try last weekend.  There is no bar, per say, but there is a small lounge that provides a comfortable transition from &quot;the world outside&quot; to the gracious, elegant decor and ambiance that Robert features.  The service was impeccable and our server patiently answered out group of 5 diners&apos; many questions.  The menu is not as straightforward as it initially appears, and I encourage folks to ask about dish preparations.  The dishes at Robert are impeccably prepared and presented. The octipus was partucularly good and the Moqueca with sea bass, shrimp, scallops and sticky rice is inspired.  Add breathtaking views </body>

        <body>The bestest thing about this very nice restaurant is the long view of Central Park it permits from its 9th floor location.  We had a window table and were enthralled by the views.  I can recommend the mussels and my guest seemed to enjoy his &quot;Dark and Stormy.&quot;  You can get a full meal or just a bite as we did.  Robert was a highlight of our Christmas in New York.</body>

        <body>Robert is quickly becoming my regular place for grabbing dinner with friends or visitors from out of town. The service is always very attentive, and the ambiance is excellent. The great view of central park is also impressive for people who haven&apos;t been to the city before.  The menu can be hit or miss. I&apos;ve enjoyed both the salmon and the filet mignon. The burrata is delicious and comes with a generous helping of cured meats and tomatos. The octopus was drenched in olive oil and soggy. Also didn&apos;t really enjoy the duck breast.  Last time I went, they had a live performer, but we were seated on the other side and couldn&apos;t hear  her (which was fine). It was a little jarring because the only thing we heard was the occasional applause from the other half of the restaurant.</body>

        <body>It was just okay. Service was decent; not friendly or rude, just okay. Food was just okay; not good or bad. I had the muscles for an appetizer which was pretty good and I had the Salmon for an entree, which definitely needed seasoning and only received half a filet of salmon instead of a full filet (even if you&apos;re located at Columbus Circle, for $32 I should have a full fillet). I also ordered it medium rare and it came out rare. My mother had the braised lamb which she said taste like roast beef. The decor is a little tacky (too many bold colors or &quot;modern&quot; furniture) and it took a lot longer to get our food than it should have, but the manager was there to check up on everyone.   To sum it all up, food wasn&apos;t bad but it was bland and wasn&apos;t restaurant worthy; service wasn&apos;t bad but waiter could have at least smiled (there was definitely an air of &quot;I don&apos;t want to be here&quot; coming from everyone working that night), and definitely took too long to get the food (30 mins between appetize</body>

        <body>Nothing can beat the view of Central Park and Columbus Circle from this unexpected gem in an area not known to celebrate its surroundings. The food is very good, the interior design is unique and stimulating. The service is terribly slow, but for tourists that must come as a welcome relief to allow them to enjoy the views longer.</body>

        <body>When my steak arrived it was over cooked. My waiter insisted on returning it and brought me a freh one cooked to my liking. The also comped me a glass of wine for the inconvenience. I was willing to eat the first steak but the waiter insisted on a new one. The service was great and so was the food.</body>

        <body>The views from Robert are fantastic and it has a nice ambience, but we found the food to be very average and incredibly overpriced.  We can think about 100 other restaurants we would&apos;ve rather eaten at costing half the price.  We were very disappointed and will not be going back or recommending it to anyone.</body>

        <body>The octopus is excellent. Scenic view through the large open windows. Nice ambience with subdued mood lighting and quiet discussions. We had a nice bottle of Pinot noir. The waiter was patient with us out of town never had been to Robert questions. While the online reviews mostly rave about the duck (which is excellent - I had a bite from my friends plate), I must say the Octopus was phenomenal.   Perfectly cooked, the right amount of tender, I would come back to taste this dish again. That is a big statement for me as I don&apos;t usually go to a restaurant in NYC a second time given the 1000s of dining options in the city.</body>

        <body>Waiter was distracted and inattentive. Clearly doesn&apos;t like his job (maybe just that day) and could not have been less personal.   We waited 15mins to place a drink order.  Food came a little too quickly and was fine but nowhere near great. the filet mignon was cooked correctly but came with a peculiar mango/pineapple like salsa that had no business being there. Some of the fries were wet.   We still had a nice time. The view is spectacular.</body>

        <body>Would not have known restaurant was 9 floors above if not for Open Table!  Colorful, modern and cozy, our service from Bryon was special and attentive.  Many times, women diners are not treated as well as couples.  Not so with our server!  We did not have window seating, but we did have diagonal view next to table of 4.  Reserve 3 weeks in advance for window table. I enjoyed seafood dish Moqueca. We were given complimentary  appetizer and dessert bites. Pass on the  pork belly appetizer. Bad experiences - large party of high school girls were next to us and very loud, waiter scolded me for taking photo of Columbus Circle past diners, even when we asked diners first.  One unisex bathroom door did not lock. Would definitely return.</body>

On both occasions I requested a window seat and received it.  The beauty and low key elegance is very impressive BUT the service is so warm and delightful and the food so Devine, we all had wonderful experiences. I thank you for truly knowing and understanding how to make this happen!  Very important to me that your location at MAD is deserving of and appreciated by the restaursant management.  Looking forward to spending many more special occasions with you. A very happy, ARLENE MAKL</body>

        <body>We chose Robert at the last minute for a business dinner based on the location and boy were we pleasantly surprised at the great time we had.  The food was excellent and the atmosphere was very well designed.</body>

        <body>Sad to say I didn&apos;t know this gem of a restaurant was in Columbus Circle. Took clients to lunch here and had a lovely view of the circle and Central Park. They couldn&apos;t stop talking about it. The decor and design were eye catching and the room felt overall comfortable. Attentive and kind service. Oh, yes and the food was good too!</body>

        <body>The food is always great, and the service likewise. There&apos;s no better view in the city.  I use Robert as my go-to place for celebrations and out of town guests.  It&apos;s located in my neighborhood but I&apos;d go there even if it weren&apos;t.  They always do their best to fulfill my requests.   My recent visit was for my friend&apos;s birthday and they gave us a lovely surprise dessert.  The service was impeccable.  And the museum upon which Robert perches is always a treat, as well.</body>

        <body>My partner and I went for our anniversary and we cannot stop talking about it.  We went right before sunset and stayed for dinner, I would recommend doing that.  We reserved a table by the window and it had the best view of Central Park and Columbus Circle.  It was a great view and the service was impeccable.  They did not miss a beat.  We had a bottle of red wine and a small plate for sunset and then moved on to the Celery Root soup and Gnocchi for dinner. We are vegetarian and they were able to accommodate without making many alterations.</body>

        <body>Just the right size dining space with large windows overlooking the city with impeccable service and a piano player. A warm feeling due to the colors and lighting. A window seat is not necessary as we were seated by the piano on a velour couch and could see the view. Theres a splash of art fulness in the decor but done classy. Great food, and an impressive wine list and amazing coctails. A visit from the chef and an a very observant waitstaff gave us that &quot;wow, we are special feeling&quot;. The Branzino and sqiuid ink pasta is what brought us there and the service and ambiance and the chef wanting to make us a special dish we requested next time we visit is why we will return.  Thank you for asking &quot;may we take your coats&quot; and perhaps next time we will go early to walk through the museum of Arts and Design before heading up to the 9th floor where Robert resides. Look for the glow of the pink square in Columbus Circle and you have arrived.</body>

        <body>+ Really modern and sumptuous design. Elegant dishes and good taste. Really good wines. Spectacular view even if you don&apos;t sit directly at the window. We were there on a Sunday at 6 and the live piano was great and not too loud. - The restrooms were not as tidy as what you should expect from such a place. Not for young children (our 3 year old was asleep) even if we did not have the feeling that the stroller would disturb. The prices are definitely too high for kids (no kids menu). But what can you expect in such a place.  Be just aware of what it is and enjoy.</body>

        <body>I used to love this place, but no more.  I have given it its last chance -- once again, food is served cold even the coffee.  My eggs benedict were bland.  SO. was the celery soup. The views are still amazing, but....</body>

        <body>We were pleasantly surprised by this place.  The tables along the front window get booked weeks in advance, but the regular tables seem to have more availabilities than other restaurants of this caliber.  It&apos;s pricey, but the food, service and ambiance are excellent and unique.</body>

        <body>We had a great time at Robert for our first anniversary.  Staff was great.  The view (if you are lucky enough to get it) is phenomenal.  We had scallops, mussels, the filet, and duck and all were well prepared and delicious.  If in NYC and celebrating a special occasion or just want a nice dinner out, give Robert a try.</body>

        <body>We made reservations a month in advance with and requested a table by the wall of windows...thank goodness as the night was gorgeous and the view of Central Park and straight down Broadway and CPW was oustanding!  Fun to look over at the concert space at the TWC in Columbus Circle.  The service was friendly and attentive without being obtrusive.  I like that they brought all 5 of our entrees out and placed them before us at the same time.  The portions aren&apos;t large by any means, just right I would say, with the exception of the &quot;to share&quot; appetizers, which I believe could be eaten by just one person.  We ordered 3 different &quot;to share&quot; apps for 5 people and we could have eaten more.  The dessert of coconut cake was very dry and not worth it.</body>

        <body>I went to Robert to celebrate my Mother’s 88th birthday.  The evening was perfect.  The food was sublime.  The staff was attentive.  The manager stopped by to ensure that we had a wonderful celebration.  We had a window seat and the view was beautiful.  I cannot wait to return to Robert.</body>

        <body>The special was a disappointment. Lamb chops were large, yes, but tought and tastless.  Service started out slow, and got slower with time. Our reservation was for 6 PM on a weeknight.  Overall, a costly experiment. There are better restaurants at a lower price, many places nearby.</body>

        <body>One of the best views in NY, but just not &quot;fit for foodies;&quot; food was mediocre.  There are restaurants in nearby Columbus Circle restaurants and shops that have better food.</body>

        <body>We arrived late from our concert at JALC and they had given our table away, but seated us in the lounge while putting a table together with a window view, for our party of 5. The cocktails were great, the food delicious, the view was fabulous, the staff was professional and lovely. I highly recommend Roberts for a special occasion dinner. I loved the red velvet birthday treats they brought to add to the evening&apos;s celebration. Only complaint: I couldn&apos;t use my MAD membership discount because the hours of use are very limited. I think a discount should be available at all times. We might have ordered another drink or two...</body>

        <body>We decided to try Robert because of its proximity to Lincoln Center.  It was a great location and the view is spectacular.  The service was excellent.  The food is a bit pricey but I guess that is par for the course in the neighborhood.  Food was ok but not hot hot hot.  I would return for lunch for a daytime view of the park.</body>

        <body>We celebrated our anniversary at Robert and had a wonderful experience. Our server was wonderful and even gave us a surprise dessert with a candle in it and in chocolate wrote &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot; - nice touch. The food was good, not the best value but when you factor in the amazing view it was worth it.   We got seats right at the window, though had to do some strong-arming with the hostess. I was disappointed when she initially put us away from the window when there were 3 vacant tables for two at the window. When I pushed her on it she mentioned the others were taken for other reservations (I was told that you could not request window tables because everyone does that). She ultimately let us sit at the window but made it clear that there was a reservation 1.5 hours later and that we might have to move. I found this a bit odd since we had a reservation and you&apos;re not allowed to reserve window seats. Initially, this was a huge negative but it ended up being a non-issue. I just didn&apos;t </body>

        <body>Our first visit and definitely not our last. Had a window view for lunch. Great view of busy Columbus Circle and the Park. Better than that, the service and food was unforgettable. They also have a jazz happy hour that we were not able to enjoy this visit, but plan to go back to. Make this a &quot;must do&quot; on your visit to NYC!</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been here a number of times. Sometimes the food has not been consistently good, but it was excellent on this visit (lunch). I had a salad with butternut squash and grains and the salmon burger. The portions were large and I barely had an appetite for dinner. My husband had the prix fixe and had celery root soup, salmon and a delicious pumpkin tart.</body>

        <body>We booked a table at Robert to end our first night in New York seduced by the potential views of Central Park. We booked about 3 week&apos;s in advance specifying a preference for a table at the full height windows. We weren&apos;t let down! The view of Columbus Circle, upper Broadway and the Park were amazing. My duck was beautifully cooked, the wines list was extensive and the service was first class. We couldn&apos;t recommend Robert any more highly.</body>

        <body>A friend recommended Robert for dinner celebrating my husband&apos;s birthday &amp; it was outstanding! 1-Your staff was attentive &amp; went the extra step to make my window request happen. 2- Our wine selection was something new but delicious. 3- My husband loves to cook, selected the pork tenderloin &amp; clams as an entrée and was intrigued.  Our waiter told the chef .  She took the time to come out and speak with us for a minute to explain the dish and invited him to email her the next time we came and she would prepare him something special! This dining experience was perfect after we visited the Art &amp; Design museum and before our evening performance at Carnegie Hall I will be calling to make reservations for our anniversary in  April and you will become a regular stop for us whether it is brunch, dinner or cocktails!  Thank you again for making our evening so special.  We&apos;ll be back!</body>

        <body>This was a repeat visit to Robert (first in Sept 2014) and we were not disappointed.  Got a corner window table for 2.  Excellent service--split salad and shared dessert.  We had braised lamb and the roast duck</body>

        <body>I had the Scottish salmon with butternut sqash and zucchini.   There are only a few fish dishes that I will eat.  The scottish salmon was very strong fish taste and i really didn&apos;t like the combination of the flavors of the squash and zucchni.  It was ok but I would  try a different dish next time. Also, we didn&apos;t have a table near the window so we didn&apos;t get to see the view from the restaurant. Overall we had an enjoyable experience.</body>

        <body>Robert was a terrific place to celebrate my daughter&apos;s new job.  We loved everything about it: food, decor, the views, waiters,hostesses, etc. We would definitely go back.   I am so happy we discoveredthismrestauranr.  Robert&apos;s food was very special!!you have a concert at the Carnegie or the Lincoln Center, Robert would be a wonderful place to dine.  I highly recommend it.</body>

        <body>We had dinner there and we had a really good time. The food was really tasteful and the service was good too. We ordered white wine which was also nice, but if we wanted it to be cool (which we did), they had to keep it away from our table, which we thought was strange! The view is really nice, even if you do not sit in a table by the window. We do recommend it.</body>

        <body>We have eaten in Robert many times since it&apos;s opening and always find the food, service and value to be exceptional. They have an extensive wine list and the food just gets better and better every time we dine here. The fois gras and dark chocolate lollipop appetizer was pure decadence. Our waiter this time was beyond exceptional and the staff that greats you both on ground level and in the restaurant could not have been kinder. We had a great view with a table at the window and we did not feel rushed as we were meeting long time friends we had not seen in years for dinner and our time was respected.  Robert keeps setting a new benchmark for other fine restaurants to achieve in NYC.</body>

        <body>Robert offered superb service and a weekend menu offering a nice variety of lunch and brunch options. On request, the waitstaff brought our birthday celebrant an elegant plate of cookies with a candle. The Sunday jazz band was a nice touch and the view over Columbus Circle was uplifting.</body>

        <body>My son and I went to Robert&apos;s for my 50th birthday dinner.   At the last minute (on a Friday night), I requested a table with a view and to my delight was seated very close to the window.  I&apos;ve never been to this restaurant, but it was highly rated on Open Table.  We were not disappointed.  The waiter was kind and helpful.  We were treated to the finest food we&apos;ve ever tasted.  My filet mignon was juicy and tender and the mashed potatoes were incredible!  My son had penne pasta with tomato basil sauce and parmesan cheese.  He loved it.  The chef sent a complimentary bite size spoons of pate to our table and afterwards, they presented me with a small plate of vanilla cake petit fours with Happy Birthday  drizzled in chocolate on the plate---a very sweet surprise!  The entire staff was attentive and the food was out of this world!---exactly what I would expect from a restaurant with such a spectacular view of Central Park.    And they did all that AND get us out in time to make it to th</body>

        <body>We have visited Robert before, and we are never disappointed. The food is excellent and varied. The wait staff is efficient without being obtrusive. Our server, Chris, was friendly, engaging, and helpful. Despite the larg number of diners, we never felt rushed. The atmosphere is casual yet elegant. The view of Central Park is outstanding!!  I would recommend Robert to anyone wanting to experience an ultimate dining experience at an afoordable price,  If you want to be seated right by the window overlooking the park, make reservations well ahead of time and follow up with a phone call about availability for those seats.</body>

        <body>I&apos;m very sorry to write this, but we were a party of 6 people and 4 of us vomited all night after dinning here. I don&apos;t know if it was a virus, or a stomach-flu, but that was how it ended.  The food didn&apos;t seem bad when we were eating it. It wasn&apos;t delicious, but it was fine. However, just one hour later we felt very dizzy and start vomiting. We had a terrible night, ended with antibiotics and having a diet for the rest of our trip. We felt good all day, so we didn&apos;t believe it was the breakfast, which was very simple. It was very sad, because the place was nice.</body>

        <body>The food was OK, but VERY overpriced.  We went there for the view and it was incredible.  Wouldn&apos;t go back for the food. . .  I think they are relying too heavily on the view.  They should work harder on the food.   My wife&apos;s filet was cooked good, but my lobster risotto was under seasoned.  I added salt and it was fine.  I just expected a better food experience with the prices they charged.  Service was nice.</body>

Friends said wine was good and so were martinis. Waiter was a little sassy and not in a good way. But overall i def will be back and def tell all my friends about it. Price point was amazing considering the location over looking Central Park.</body>

        <body>Food and decor was dated. We had 3 courses and from coats being taken to check was maybe 35 minutes. I had the Tuna app and it was very fishy tasting which we all knows mean it&apos;s not fresh. We were sat at a table next to a table with a view that no one sat at the whole time. Our server was nice and helpful but otherwise no redeeming qualities here! We even opted to have our after dinner drinks and dessert elsewhere knowing that the view might be less but the experience would be better!</body>

        <body>We didn&apos;t have as much luck as previous at Robert.  Positives include being  serviced well throughout our meal. Restaurant decor is modern and contemporary in style, with an interesting colour scheme. Views over southern side of Central Park are nice.   Unfortunately, the dishes we ordered at Robert didn&apos;t measure up to others tried at restaurants during this trip to New York City. We tried two pasta dishes, the first being the pappardelle served with a cream sauce and white truffle oil. This was a generally good dish, the truffle flavour came through and the noodles were cooked nicely (rating 3.25 of 5).  We also tried the Risotto with butternut squash, sprout leaves and cranberries that didn&apos;t seem prepared very well. The risotto was soft and mushy, we prefer firm to slightly al-dente style. Further, the squash had a bland taste, offering little flavour to the dish. In the end, this was a visually appealing dish but didn&apos;t seem to be prepared very well (2.5 of 5).   Lastly, we tried</body>

The view up Broadway is great but if you want to be sitting right at a window you must reserve far in advance. A very nice spot to enjoy a cocktail (Venetian sparkler) or a beer (Blue Point IPA).  The food is imaginative and very well-prepared. My wife had the duck breast; placed on a foundation of chestnut puree, she found it excellent. I had pork tenderloin with clams -- a pairing I would not have thought of, but it worked well. We split a panna cotta and added a machiato and a black coffee to our drinks (hoping the caffeine would help us stay alert throughout the opera). It all worked out very well; the ten-minute walk to the entry of the Met was enough to wake us up.  Our waiter, Daniel, was very good -- a real professional.  With tax and tip it came to about $140 -- not inexpensive, but we certainly did enjoy the meal!</body>

        <body>So the décor is very bright, fun, and even comfortable.  I had a business lunch at Robert and the view of Central Park and Columbus Circle is fantastic!  (Probably much better in the Spring or Fall than it was in mid-January, but it still impresses).  The food was good--but nothing special. (I had Seared tuna Salad Nicoise my guest had butternut squash risotto. Good, but no raves.) The service was attentive, but clumsy.  Waiters bumping into us and even scaring us a bit as they whisked away dishes abruptly from unseen locations...not very professional.  We felt only slightly rushed--not too bad for NYC lunch.    All said, I&apos;d go back for the view and maybe sit at the bar for cocktails.  It&apos;s on the more expensive side, so I hoped for more in terms of flavor, creativity, etc. in the food.  I tipped only slightly better than 15% which is typically on the low side for me.</body>

        <body>Reading that Robert was housed within the museum of arts gave me pause - would it work well in the evening? Oh yes it most certainly does! An Eclectic mix of funky bar, cosy but vibrant dining area, really interesting decor and lighting and great views of colombus circle. Add to that an interesting menu that had something for everyone (including a teenager and a 7 year old), good value wine list and great service ! Will definitely be back!!</body>

        <body>It was mostly awesome; I&apos;ve been there several times and always had a good time.  The service was a little off this last time but not enough to really mar the evening, a great get together with my godson, whom I haven&apos;t seen for awhile.</body>

        <body>This was the second year in a row I&apos;ve hosted a small group for brunch at Robert and each experience surpassed my expectations. The view is spectacular, it is light and cheerful with lovely paintings on the walls. There were many inviting menu options, the food was terrific and the service was magnificent.</body>

        <body>Lovely waiting staff, very attentive and happy to give me quiet advice about which wines to drink with my meal which was much appreciated as I don&apos;t get the chance to dine out often.  Lovely treat for my daughter and myself on Christmas Day.  Beautiful views and loved the live music.  Although we had requested a window table we didn&apos;t get one which was  a disappointment - we had travelled from Scotland and really wanted it to be perfect.  Requested but e-mail indicated it was just luck of the draw though so we took a chance.  That was only drawback to an otherwise perfect evening.</body>

        <body>We had dinner at Robert for my mother-in-laws 88th birthday and had a fabulous time, from start to finish. There were two lovely young ladies who took our coats in the lobby of the building and who were very friendly. When we arrived upstairs 20 minutes early, our table was ready so we were seated immediately. I had reserved a window table about a month in advance and....wow! I read there was a great view from the window tables but this view was spectacular! A view right down into Columbus Circle, and you can see the vast expanse of Central Park, and right down Broadway and Central Park West. We got there while it was still light but as it got dark the view was even more wonderful as everything lit up. Towards the end of our dinner we noticed a ballerina and her partner dancing in Columbus Circle; her dress was all lit up with LED lights, it was quite magical. As far as noise in the restaurant goes, at first it seemed like it was ear-splitting but then we realized it was all coming fr</body>

        <body>If after almost a week we are still thinking positive about our experience in Robert, I guess we can recommend this restaurant. It was a pleasant brunch. The service was good, attentive, relatively quick. Yes, they forgot to bring the bread and butter at the beginning, but they brought it together with the brunch. Yes, the forgot to bring the petit fours at the end, but they brought them after we asked for them. The grilled cheese eggs benedict was quite good, tasty; as well as the salmon sandwich. The added value of this place, the excellent view. It is difficult to get a table by the window, but a table in the lounge is also good. Recommended.</body>

        <body>The view of central park is nice, if you get a seat there. The food is forgettable.  Was there for brunch and had the steak and eggs. The steak was chewy and had to be &apos;sawed&apos;.  The &apos;thick cut&apos; chips could have come from any bag bought at a deli. The feel and decor were nice. But didn&apos;t justify the cost considering the quality of the food.</body>

        <body>Booked here 2 weeks in advance and got a window table at lunchtime for our anniversary. The waiter brought out a special dessert for us with &quot;happy anniversary&quot; written in chocolate. Very surprised.  Food is great and very reasonable with a great lunchtime prix fixe menu. It is a lovely setting with a great view but not snobby or pretentious. Dont feel you have to dress up just dont be scruffy, smart jeans are fine.  I would recommend to anyone, and try to get a window seat it will be worth it.</body>

        <body>We just went to have a coffee and a piece of cake, it was great for the amazing view. The dessert was ok, not the best but it completely worth it. The staff is so friendly!</body>

        <body>Robert is the whole package.  Great food, attentive service and a wonderful view.  The menu had such interesting choices and the meals were beautifully prepared.  We were a table of 4 and every plate was wiped clean.  Highly recommend a visit.</body>

        <body>Robert was worth the visit simply for the view.  If you&apos;re lucky enough to get a window table, the views of Central Park are amazing.  The venue itself is on the pricey side, but the service is quick, attentive and pleasant.  We ordered sandwiches (one Caprese and a Chicken Avocado) and both were tasty.  The Basil Martini was delicious despite the cost.  The staff recognized our anniversary which was a surprising additional touch.   The prices are probably considered &apos;normal&apos; for NY; therefore, I would recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>We dined here on New Year&apos;s Day.  What a great meal!  The fresh fig, ham, and goat cheese salad was divine.  The goat cheese was some of the freshest that I have ever had.  Our entrees were fantastic as well (risotto &amp; gnocchi).  The service was attentive but not overbearing.  For the location &amp; quality, the prices were cheap!</body>

        <body>This was our first time dining at Robert and we had a great experience.  I booked about three weeks in advance on Open Table and a note popped up asking me to call if I had an special requests.  We definitely wanted a window table so I called and requested that specifically.  It is worth the advance planning as you are 9 stories above Columbus circle and can see into Central Park and the Upper West side.  There was a jazz duo playing when we arrived and the waiter was very attentive.  He took the time to describe the specials in detail and the wait staff did their job without interfering with our meal.  I had a salad and the risotto of the day, both of which were very good.  It is on the expensive side, so do go and take advantage of the view.</body>

        <body>Absolutely incredible experience for Valentine&apos;s Day. We were treated so well by the staff, I cannot say enough good things. After dinner, we were able to move to the lounge area for drinks, and to take in the live music and view. So incredible. Not to mention, the food is out of this world. Definitely recommend for romantic dates - Robert has that impressive wow factor on every level.</body>

        <body>Hosted a 40th Birthday here for Brunch.  This is a restaurant that easily slips between casually elegant and romantic spot.  The staff couldn&apos;t be more accommodating, the food was really well done, the cocktails were superb, and the view is simply stunning.  Would love to return the next time I&apos;m in town.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Robert on two occasions, once for cocktails and the second time for dinner. Cocktails were great. But dinner not so much. I ordered the octopus entree which was super buttery that I couldn&apos;t finish my vegetables. The service was also a little lagging considering the type of restaurant it is. Overall, it&apos;s a pleasant ambiance, and well designed space. Also not too loud so you can actually carry a conversation with the table.</body>

        <body>Three of us enjoyed Sunday brunch and all said our food was good. The view is only great if you are at a window table, otherwise Robert becomes a normal restaurant.  The room is L shaped with a jazz band in the entrance dining area that overlooks Central Park.  Therefore, if you sit in that portion, expect the volume to be ... generous.</body>

        <body>I have had lunch here twice and it was very good. dinner was mediocre at best, and very overpriced for what it was.  the service was very slow to clean the table and as a result we didnt have time for a special birthday dessert that we had ordered, so we had to cancel it. i would not go back here for dinner.</body>

        <body>Working in a small team for a larger corporate has its downsides; but being able to take the team to Robert has definitely been a plus. We ate as a group of five, and each of us thoroughly enjoyed the experience that Robert provides. On being sat (at a window table overlooking Columbus Circle and Central Park, as requested), the restaurant efficiently provided the prosecco as has been requested on the table reservation notes. We were given time to sit and chat, perusing the menu, over wine; with the waiter diligently keeping an eye on the table, ensuring that water glasses were filled and we were able to settle in. The orders were taken and, prior to the appetisers arriving, the table was treated to amuse-bouches of cicchetti (olive tapenade). While the amuse-bouches were well complemented by the prosecco, the waiter/sommelier assisted with choosing a punchy Sauvignon Blanc that pleased the whole table. The appetisers were tasty and well seasoned, each member of our table having somet</body>

        <body>Had an amazing meal at Robert to celebrate our small (party of 4) wedding. We were very well looked after by Joe, who was knowledgeable, very friendly and helpful, without being intrusive. The restaurant was perfect - very cool modern interior, unbelievable views, great atmosphere with live music. Fantastic food - steak and octopus especially - good wine and gorgeous desserts. We were treated to complimentary extra dessert and champagne, were the last party in the restaurant after closing (more than 3 hours after we arrived), we weren&apos;t rushed, and left full, high, and very happy. Thanks for such a wonderful night.</body>

        <body>Not that I&apos;m a fine dining expert but this place had it all. The night began by my date and I showing up a little late, fifteen minutes or so, we were seated right away. First thing I noticed was that Robert had a good amount of people wearing suits and dresses, I had read that this was a pretty casual place so decided to stick to a middle ground of jeans and a button up and nice sneakers. I felt under dressed but not a word was said and I was comforted by the arrival of a family in t-shirt and jeans. The waiter came right over, took our order promptly and within  a couple minutes the first course was out. I had ordered the scallops as a appetizer and was not disappointed. Next up was the filet Mignon for me and the salmon for my date. I&apos;ve never eaten a meal so slowly and enjoyed it so thoroughly. We were so happy with our meals we decided to split a caramel mousse dessert and that put a very tasty cap on the night. Our waiter was friendly and professional as was the entire wait staf</body>

        <body>Celebrating a friend&apos;s birthday.  We had a wonderful window table looking out over Columbus Circle, the park and more.  She was delighted.  Food was really good.  Everyone loved what they had.  Seafood dominated our table.  They give you a little amuse bouche and then a tiny taste of something sweet at the end of the meal, nice touch.  This is my go to place for friends in from out of town because the food is consistently good and the view is spectacular.  Jazz in the bar on Saturday night is a really nice touch.  We had the extra bonus of having a couple at the next table get engaged during dinner.  Everyone was thrilled and applauded.</body>

        <body>We were fortunate to secure a window table  as the view over Broadway, Central Park West and Central Park is spectacular and worth the visit.  The menu and the meal were less memorable. Our waitress was lovely.  If one is visiting the MAD museum and can arrange to sit by a window - not in the back facing an apartment house - it is a good choice.</body>

        <body>I love their view and food but I hate the service!. The hostess was just plain and serious didn&apos;t even smile when we walked in and our waiter was extremely rude. If they had better staff this would be an awesome place!.</body>

        <body>We were visiting from UK, thoroughly enjoyed the food, were well looked after by waiting staff and the view  of the park and streets was fabulous. Well worth a visit. We booked for early eve so we could see in daylight and dark, would recommend it.</body>

        <body>Great view but if you are not able to secure a table by the windows (long wait list), then I feel the food does not deserve the prices. Beyond cost, quality was good though but the dishes did not have anything special. on the other hand, the cocktails were quite creative.</body>

        <body>I had dinner here for the first time in over a year, I went for a pre-concert (at the Time Warner Center) dinner.   I really enjoyed it, all the food (both mine and my date&apos;s) was excellent. The plating of the food was attractive.  The service was friendly, the ambiance very good. If you get a table next to the window, the view is great.  As the tables are a touch close together, I don&apos;t think I would call it romantic, one of our neighboring tables overheard something we said and started a conversation with us.   Robert seems halfway between two other restaurants in the Columbus Circle area in price.  Its a step up from Landmarc, and  a step down from Porterhouse.   I was a bit bummed that they have a no outside wine policy, so this won&apos;t be a regular place for me.  But it is worth stopping in every so often. The live jazz music was a plus.</body>

        <body>The view is amazing and the interior decor is definitely artistic. For my second time eating at the restaurant, there were fewer choices on the menu and what was is on the menu is boring. Burger was good.</body>

        <body>We took a trip to New York from the UK in December &apos;14. We chose this as our New Years restaurant as the price was good for the early sitting and the view looked amazing - it didn&apos;t dissapoint. We ended up being able to stay at the bar area so watched the ball drop on the TV and then saw the fireworks at Central park from the glass window. All with a singer and the band playing.  The food we had was gorgeous and they catered it to me being a vegetarian. Service - perfect. Our waiter was David who was so friendly and kept checking we were okay.  The view here is incredible, try and get a table near the windows.  Amazing experience for NYE and would definitely choose this restaurant again.</body>

        <body>We enjoyed a wonderful lunch on Fri. Feb. 27,2015. We had the celery root soup, salmon with butternut squash, and pumpkin cheesecake with cranberry foam.  (all part of the prix fixe menu) Beautiful presentation of each course and delicious! Javier, our waiter, was very attentive and professional, as was the entire staff that worked our table. The awesome view of Central Park, Broadway, and Columbus Circle just adds to the entire experience. This was my second time there.  I will definitely be back. I would highly recommend this restaurant!</body>

        <body>Coming in from out of town my boyfriend and I found this restaurant lovely! Overall a great experience. The restaurant is well put together in a very modern look, the service was great and the food absolutely delicious ! However I did find it a bit tight spaced since we found ourselves basically touching elbows with the people next to us. Also I recommend asking for a table at the window preferably since it will give you the extra room and the view is beautiful !</body>

        <body>I decided to bring the leadership of my company to Robert. We were 10. I asked for a specific table and it was ready for us the moment we arrived. Incredible service and food to impress a group of co workers. The view is unbeatable. And most of all the food is perfect. Everything about robert is simply perfect. The artsy decorations and central park view just push it to excellence. The sommelier was also amazing and helped me pic the wine for the night. Great guy who really knew what he was doing. What a perfect night out.</body>

        <body>All windows and even if you are not seated at the windows you can expereince the views. Daylight spills in. I was there for lunch and I can&apos;t wait to be there for dinner. A unique expereince if you are into resturants with views. The food was great too!</body>

        <body>My wife and I ate here last weekend and everything about our dining experience was sub-standard and disappointing.   We were having a belated birthday/valentine&apos;s day dinner and asked to be seated near the window (for the view) and some place where the noise level wouldn&apos;t be offensive.   We were seated in a two-top with literally six inches between other two tops on either side of us.   We asked to be reseated somewhere quieter which we promptly were.  It then took us 10 minutes for someone to bring menus, the menu was bluntly boring and unoriginal.   we ordered three courses (two appetizers, share a pasta, then two entrees) but it took so long for our first two courses to come that we ultimately cancelled our third course and paid the bill.   Then even though we had had multiple conversations with the manager about the service, nothing was comped and no apology was extended.   The quality of the food was fine...  Just a lousy experience  overall and would not recommend Robert for an</body>

        <body>As always,  lunch was delicious, the view spectacular, and the staff gracious and welcoming.   My friend fell in love with the restaurant and can&apos;t wait to return.  They even brought her gluten free bread, which made her so happy.   It was very special.</body>

        <body>I looked on Google Maps for a restaurant near Jazz at Lincoln Center, and found Robert.  It&apos;s on the 9th floor of the Museum of Arts and Design  on the north-east corner of 8th and 58th, and the view of Columbus Circle and the streets in the distance is spectacular.  And the food was excellent too!  I always look for things I would not usually cook myself, and the menu did not disappoint.  We shared an appetizer of burrata, fresh figs, serrano ham, and tiny heirloom tomatoes that was just perfect.  I chose the duck breast and my husband had the pork tenderloin, which were both served exactly to the degree of doneness that we requested and with very tasty saucing.  And there were several other things on the menu that made it VERY difficult to choose.  Service was friendly and attentive.  All in all, a great choice., particularly as the city turns from day to night.</body>

        <body>I booked this restaurant from England a week or two before our trip to New York.  I mentioned that our trip was to celebrate my wife&apos;s 50th birthday and requested a window table, just on the off chance we might get one. Toy surprise, we did and it was an excellent view.   The food was excellent and the portions were bigger than expected. Our server David was very attentive and the whole experiment was topped off with a plate containing two bit size pieces of birthday cake, a candle and happy birthday written on the plate.   A lovely touch that made the whole experience feel personal.   Best evening in New York City</body>

        <body>Had brunch here with my gf. Sadly couldn&apos;t get a window seat, as we were told you needed them a month in advance. The place was fairly crowded for a Saturday brunch, which is always a good sign. Food for brunch was solid, and though the view wasn&apos;t quite like sitting next to the window, it was still beautiful, and would be even better at night for sure, even if you weren&apos;t by the window.</body>

        <body>I went to Robert for my birthday with a few friends.  The restaurant is beautiful and we really loved the ambiance.  I can&apos;t talk much about the scenery since I didn&apos;t have window seats but from what I saw it looked really nice.  The food is fair, I&apos;ve had better.  I had the salmon dish with a side of kale if that helps.  The service was good and we especially loved the waiter who took pictures for us there.  He was so funny.  I wish we caught his name but he was great. We were there the night they had a pianist there and it really set a nice mood.  I would recommend this restaurant for special occasions or date night.</body>

        <body>I went to Robert&apos;s for the first time on Monday and I loved it. I had a delicious veggie wrap and my husband had a burger. My food tasted great and the presentation was wonderful. The views of Central Park are amazing and so is the decor. The waitress up to the manager were also great. I highly recommend going to Robert&apos;s.</body>

        <body>Our experience at Robert was simply amazing. I could not find one critique or thing worth improving on, even if I tried. For a late anniversary dinner at 5:30, the view was magical. Columbus circle was filled with lights and you could see the East Side skyline frame Central Park with lights. I couldn&apos;t get enough of the view -- it is definitely one of the best I&apos;ve seen in a NYC restaurant.   The food selection varied very well -- each option was different and anyone could easily find at least 1-2 things to eat without a problem. I took the filet mignon. It was done to perfection and it was so tender and beautifully served with mashed potato purée. My parents took the duck and the lamb. They found their dishes ALSO very delicious and cooked to perfection. The presentation of the food was also very aesthetic and appealing to the eye. In addition, we also took dessert - caramel chocolate mousse. For someone as myself who doesn&apos;t love caramel nor chocolate mousse, it was the most amazing</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been wanting to try Robert&apos;s for some time now, and we finally made a reservation for brunch to check it out. Our party included small children and we thought the restaurant was quite welcoming of them - handing out little Wiki stix to occupy the little ones while we waited for our table. There were lots of choices for food, and although the ingredients were all fresh, nothing really stood out.  I&apos;m glad we tried this place but would probably go elsewhere next time.</body>

It&apos;s a New York experience for friends, couples and families - New Yorkers and visitors.

        <body>We have been there three times and will return again, because we get a window seat and sit enthralled by the view below, taking photos, flirting with the wait staff, and enjoying the beautiful presentations of food and deserts. The wrong desert was delivered to our table; the remedy was to bring the correct one, leaving us with two gorgeous deserts. But imagine my discomfort while using the unisex toilet (also an awesome view below) to discover there was not a smidgen of paper in the restroom.  Not a toilet tissue, not a kleenex, not a hand towel and not even anything in the trash can!  Thanks goodness I had a few wet wipes in my purse.  The staff was very apologetic and gave us free entrance to the museum (which we didn&apos;t need because we have memberships).  Oh well, accidents will happen.</body>

        <body>The atmosphere and abmiance are great, especially if you can get a window table (great view of Columbus Circle and Central Park).  The service was impeccable.  The food had great presentation and tasted wonderful.  Only downside, and it was a huge downside, was the cost.  $20 for two scallops?  After dropping $100/person, you shouldn&apos;t need to stop for pizza on the way home. . . . .</body>

        <body>By the time I made the reservation, all tables by the window were not available. But the lucky thing is, when we just seated in another table, one table by the window is canceled and we were invited to seated there! That was really the most lucky thing!!   The service is great and the view is great. Piano with cello made the atmosphere incomparable.  Definitely a great place for dinner!</body>

        <body>Glad we returned to Robert for dinner. The menu seems small, but has many options and the kitchen is quite flexible. Loved the Bacalao last time; and loved the pork tenderloin with clams (yes, you read right!) this time. Great combinations... The Tuna Crudo for appetizer for delightful and will be a &quot;must&quot; when we return. Cocktail selection good, as was the Wine List. Our server was very busy, but attentive. The manager seemed to be helping on the floor in a very quiet manner. We liked that. Even without a table right at the window, the view remains very NYC... but the music, food and libations are certainly the center of attention!</body>

        <body>Robert is an amazing gem in NYC. It is easy to get and has an awesome view of the park. Even on a rainy day all we could do was enjoy the food, wine and company while staring out over the park.</body>

        <body>Great service. Great food. Fantastic views. They don&apos;t have an actual bar where you can wait but they have a great lounge with great views as well.  Thi is my favorite brunch place to take guests from out of town.</body>

        <body>It was my first time and the chef and waitor was very kind. We had a corner table surrounding windows which was pretty but kind of tight. The food was very good but there was little variety.  I liked the place overall.</body>

<author>OpenTable.com</author>
        <body>Renowned Chef Tim McKee, 2009 James Beard award winner for ?Best Chef Midwest?, designed the core menu for Sea Change which focuses on sustainable seafood, highlighting fisheries that use environmentally responsible methods of gathering and farming seafood. The menu also includes a number of items under the heading ?Not Fish? as well as late night offerings of small plates and raw bar selections. &lt;br /&gt;</body>

        <body>This restaurant has an ultra nice decor. I noticed how airy it is. Most restaurants are stuffy but this one with its high ceilings breathes new life into a dining experience. The open kitchen was refreshing to see. The artsy work was on full display and the food that came out from that workshop was nothing short of amazing. My NYE dinner was filled with astonishing moments and just pure amazement. The shaved abalone with rolled aspargus was one of my favorites along with the grilled octopus. The lobster special for the evening was also incredible. Moist, succulent and above all, tasteful. The lobster foam was delectable and playful, much like the rest of the plates. The lime cake pudding was not only appealing to the eye but was also scrumptious. My mouth salivates from even writing this!!! Do not hesistate to go there. It&apos;s a work of art. Art that you can eat!  If seafood is what you want, come here! Come here to be amazed!  P.S. Even with all the cooking going on, the kitchen ventil</body>

        <body>After purchasing tickets for the Matinee performance of Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream ( my granddaughters&apos; first Shakespearian play), we decided to celebrate her birthday ( which actually was a few days later) at brunch at the Sea Change beforehand.  We had a wonderful time, excellent food and a lovely, relaxing way to share our time together. And as we finished our meal, our waiter brought Mimi a little gift from the kitchen - she was delighted, as were we all. We had a wonderful time and look forward to our next visit.</body>

        <body>A delicious lunch before a great show is a good way to spend part of a wintry Sunday afternoon. My oysters were so fresh and tasty that they didn&apos;t need any of the horseradish that was provided. They tasted like the sea itself. The crab benedict was delicious, with two perfect poached eggs topped with a mild hollandaise. A dry white wine from Spain, whose name I can&apos;t recall, was an excellent accompaniment, and the show that followed was every bit as good. The service, provided by a charming and smiling young woman, made everything even better.</body>

        <body>Because of it&apos;s proximity to the Guthrie, Sea Change could be less than stellar and still be in business.  But the breadth of the menu choices, the creativity and attention to detail of the dishes offered and the incredible service and location make this a go to place whether you&apos;re attending a performance or not.</body>

        <body>They try very hard to be a high end place, but miss the mark on the food.   Seared Tuna was a joke. It was overcooked then they cover it in mayo to cover how bad it is. Octopus, their signature dish, tasted like it is dipped in Aunt Jemima Syrup and seared on a grill. And can somebody show them what a mignonette is?   Service was slow, really slow. 45 minutes for an app slow. Server could have been a little more pleasant but, when you work in a bad place, being happy can be a challenge.   Love the Guthrie, very disappointed in Sea Change.</body>

        <body>We had pre-theatre dinner on a Saturday during the prescribed safe time to eat comfortably.  The server was very friendly however service was extremely uneven to outright missing.  There were multiple occasions when we wondered when we would get service, water had been emptied the wine had not been served before we were half way through our starter course.  The food; the octupus was fantastic as well as the cod.  The Ahi tuna was a miss, it was served rare as requested but the whole dish wasn&apos;t even luke warm.  The beet salad was fine however I think it would have been better if the raw beets had been left off, the texture did not help the dish.  The ambience is beautiful, the convenience to the guthrie perfect.</body>

        <body>This was my first time at SeaChange.  I brought a client here on a Monday night, which was probably the only downer of the experience because if there isn&apos;t a performance going on at Guthrie that night this place is almost too quiet, even though it&apos;s still a beautiful place.   They told us it&apos;s wall to wall packed the hour and a half before curtain on show nights, which I totally believe.  Once we got over the lack of crowd, the food more than made up for any shortfalls.  The presentation was marvelous. The taste spot on.  I would imagine this food would sell well in a city like San Francisco, it had that &apos;plate painting&apos; method I had seen out there.  The manager even stopped by, acknowledged he had been told it was both of our first times there and asked for feedback.  Wow on service!  Will be back again, maybe right before the theater rush :)</body>

        <body>They are very good at cooking seafood properly (tender, tasty, etc.), but are very heavy-handed on the sauces.  What could have been delectable bites of razor clam, octopus, etc., were overwhelmed by the flavors around them.  The octopus was drowning in its sauce.  That being said, the general -cooking- of the seafood was great. The oyster selection was also very good, although I cannot say the same for the wines that came in the pairing.</body>

        <body>My friends and I visited Sea Change for lunch.  We couldn&apos;t have been happier with the food, service, and décor.  Our server was helpful and attentive.  Portion size was perfect, and plating was lovely.  We all agreed that we will be back, particularly for the wonderful view from the outdoor seating in the summer.</body>

        <body>This is the second time we have done brunch and it was even better. The crab cake Benedict, Arctic char and my favorite the smoked salmon Tartine are all familiar dishes with sophisticated touches.  Easter brunch is done so well here and is such a delight compared to the frenetic atmosphere of many restaurants   Highly recommended.</body>

        <body>Attached to the Guthrie, Sea Change is mindful of your schedule while still trying to provide a slow dining experience. A knowledgeable and caring staff is never to far away. They do seem to love to describe the food. Quality, tasty, small portioned sea food is the fair, but don&apos;t worry, you can easily get a second basket of bread if your looking to fill up; and it is good bread.</body>

        <body>The Sea Change exceeded our expectations for our New Years Eve Dinner this year. The atmosphere was contemporary, comfortable and quiet with the ability to have conversation during our wonderful dinner.  The staff was very responsive to every need and our server Jonathan was perfect on timing of every course. For starters we shared the Shrimp Cocktail with habañero cocktail sauce, which was very tasty and it was a nice touch when you get the appetizer divided on two plates when we indicated we would like to share.  Main courses were fresh poached lobster, which was the special for the evening and was amazing and the Pan Roasted Monkfish for my wife. She almost didn’t have the Monkfish because it came with Brussel Sprouts (childhood aversion) but enjoyed both immensely.  For desserts we shared Lime Pudding Cake, which concluded the meal in a decadent fashion with wonderful flavors. Since moving to downtown Minneapolis a few years ago we have tried many restaurants but had not yet tried</body>

        <body>Can&apos;t beat the convenience of a nice restaurant in the same building as the Guthrie&apos;s theaters. We had a party of five and we each ordered different mains. None were bad, but only one was memorable - the Arctic Char. Again, the food was all good and the service was great...perhaps I was suffering from a case of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;.  Overall, I left a bit disappointed. I was hoping for something that paired stronger with the great performances on the stage. But the convenience factor may bring me back the next time we go to the Guthrie.</body>

        <body>We are new to living downtown, and had walked past this restaurant several times without a second glance. A friend told us to check it out and we are so happy we did! This is ranking right up there as one of our favorites in the already amazing Mpls. Restaurant line up! We started with super tasty oysters, you know the kind that are fresh firm and oh so yummy! The beet salad was one of my all time favorites. I had the Ahi tuna, large portion with melt in your mouth scrumciousness! My husband had the cod which he loved as well. Our waiter had a fun since of humor, gave us time to enjoy each dish and still got us to our event on time. We will definitely make that part of our Guthrie experience moving forward and maybe even on non theatre nights.</body>

        <body>Made a reservation for lunch for a Saturday before a Guthrie matinee. We were very disappointed that the menu was a brunch menu with many breakfast-type foods. We don&apos;t go to a seafood place looking for eggs and bacon, omelets with ham, etc. Servers were pleasant, as was ambiance - big windows overlooking Mississippi River.</body>

        <body>Sea Change is now our favorite restaurant in Minneapolis. Seafood at its very best. Our grilled shrimp served with watercress and a chicken and ham reduction was a phenomenal appetizer.  The romaine Caesar salad served with a poached egg, anchovies and croutons was perfect!   Our entrée, crusted cod with mushrooms, potatoes and poached egg was outstanding. This was a wonderful dining experience.  WE&apos;LL BE BACK!</body>

        <body>This was our second time at Sea Change and we were less than impressed both times. Everything started out great. We were promptly seated and given water and our menus and then completely forgotten about for at least 10 minutes. We had to flag down the assistant server.  A bit later our server showed up but he didn&apos;t apologize or acknowledge the mistake. It&apos;s disappointing to have this happen. The food was great and despite what others say about small portions we found them to be more than adequate.  I doubt we&apos;ll be back for dinner again. Perhaps happy hour but it&apos;s not top of our list.  We frequent the Guthrie so it&apos;s disappointing that we can&apos;t depend on Sea Change for our pre-show dinner.</body>

        <body>My husband and I ate at Sea Change for a special meal with two nieces. It was a wonderful experience, with excellent food, attentive service, beautiful setting. However, the feeling of the evening was soiled by the waiter&apos;s offer of making us a sampler plate for appetizers. My husband asked him the cost, and he said &quot;per item.&quot; We went with it  without clarifying further, received a beautiful plate of appetizers, and were shocked to see it cost $150! This in addition to drinks and entrees made for an unexpectedly expensive evening. Lesson learned: order just what you want and don&apos;t be duped by this offer of special service by your server.</body>

        <body>We were entertaining people for business.  The food was excellent and the service was good, but just a bit slow.  I am sure that was by design, but at times it did seem that we were waiting a bit.</body>

        <body>Sea Change is usually a go-to place for sea food for us, but this last trip was lackluster. The ambiance was a bust this time around. With low volume in the restaurant, the waitstaff had no energetic attitude and the raw bar, which is usually a place of action, was quieter than quiet. the food was delicious, but there was confusion with the presentation on the oysters and they ran out of one plate. The octopus and salmon terrine, however, were delicious. It is disappointing to see Sea Change fall to this level, and I am hoping it is just this one occasion.</body>

        <body>This was the third time my wife and I ate at Sea Change, although the first when not also attending a show at the Guthrie - and every time we ask why we don&apos;t come more often!  It is with little doubt the most enjoyable place to eat out in town for us.  The service is never short of impeccable and the food presentation and quality beyond reproach.  If you love exquisite sea food, this is where to eat in the Twin Cities!</body>

        <body>I had only been here for dinner previously, but it is a wonderful option for brunch.  It was not particularly expensive (you can drop a bundle for dinner), and the wait staff and ambiance of the room are lovely.  I was surprised that it was so empty before a Sunday Gurthrie mantinee -- perhaps people don&apos;t think of it as a weekend spot for daytime dining.</body>

        <body>The atmosphere is stately without being stuffy. And, with the almost subliminal music in the dining area, it&apos;s truly refreshing to be able to converse without having to shout. With a party of 8, we had several dishes from the raw, starter and main menus. (We continue to be impressed by Sea Change&apos;s adherence to sustainable sources for their menu.) From presentation to taste and texture, everything was excellent. Indeed, I&apos;d be hard pressed to praise one particular item over another. Cocktails, wine and deserts were also superlative. Service was extremely attentive, but never intrusive. This was a birthday celebration, and the guest of honor encapsulated the experience when she termed the evening &quot;magical&quot;.</body>

        <body>We have been going to Sea Change annually for many years and this visit was quite disappointing.  The menu has not changed over the years, and it now feels stale and in need of a freshening up.  My go-to bouillabaisse was a big disappointment this time--not much seafood and the pieces were overdone.  My husband&apos;s monkfish was &apos;okay&apos;.  The farro bean side was heavy on the vinegar and spices and clashed with our other dishes.  It was a light crowd for a Friday evening, so the waitstaff did not have much to do other than hover.  There are so many other trendy, up-to-date options in the Twin Cities--we&apos;ll be moving on.</body>

        <body>If you like Oysters and seafood - the food is marvelous.  The grilled shrimp were phenomenal.  We found Creme Fraiche in every one of our dishes.  Its a bit rich and I would prefer different flavors. Great restaurant, great service.</body>

        <body>We had only stopped for drinks before and were so glad we finally dined at Sea Change. What a lovely place with a delicious menu. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. We recommend the tuna poke starter as a must. Our server was very knowledgeable about the wine and the food. We will return.</body>

        <body>Every New Year we get our best friends together and one couple selects a new fun spot for the eight of us to enjoy. This year we selected Sea Change and we had a delightful evening: great seafood that was masterfully prepared, excellent service and beautiful surroundings! Thanks for offering a wide variety of excellent seafood above and beyond the typical MN walleye and trout. We will return soon for the late night bar scene and raw bar.</body>

        <body>The food was OK, but not at a level we expected in that price range.  The trout was a definite disappointment.  On the plus side, they split our two starters onto separate plates so it was easy to share.  I was really surprised that the laundry service they use for their wait staff must use a heavily scented fabric softener.  It was quite noticeable every time one of the staff was near our table.  Not what I would expect from an otherwise very nice atmosphere.</body>

        <body>Perfect for dinner prior to a show at the Guthrie.  You must try the octopus...delicious.   Our server Jonathan was amazing, and the rest of the staff pleasant and attentive.    They let us leave our coat in their coat room while we watched the show, and even though we didn&apos;t end with a nightcap there after the show, they were more than happy to retrieve our coat, ask how the show was, and if we enjoyed our evenening.  The staff seemed to truly enjoy working there.  Oh one more thing...the deserts were absolutely to die for.  I rarely eat desert at a restaurant, but am so glad we did this night.  Thanks for a be part of our fabulous evening.</body>

        <body>I have had several meals at Sea Change, and it never disappoints.  The wait staff was welcoming and friendly without being intrusive.  The main waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu items and enjoyed sharing her enthusiasm for the dishes.  As always, the food was perfect.  I had a   delightful cod on a bed of spinach with various additions including a perfectly poached egg and wonderfully crispy potatoes. The combination of textures and tastes was a party for the palate!  Thank you again for another great meal.</body>

My only complaint was that the cup of decaf coffee I ordered with dessert came cold and a bit stale. The waitress brewed up fresh coffee, but this came too late to accompany my dessert.</body>

        <body>This is pre-theater dining at its very best!  Little plates of seafood from the raw bar are unusual and fun to taste.  Of course the fish is wonderful, but they also have some menu items that &quot;are not fish.&quot;  Cocktails great too, and must rave about the desserts.   So fun to eat here before a Guthrie Show.  We really like the bench-style table seating.  Our server was delightful - so sorry I forgot her name, but she made the evening very special.</body>

        <body>I love fresh seafood, and I have eaten many wonderful meals at Sea Change.  However, last Sunday night was a disappointment.  Even though the restaurant was nearly empty, with no show at the Guthrie, service was extremely slow.  And when our entrees finally arrived, everything on my plate of ahi tuni was cold or lukewarm.  I would hesitate to return.</body>

        <body>Everything we ate at Sea Change was delicious. My personal favorite was the langoustines from the raw bar. Second favorite was the chiClem fried oysters.  Service was outstanding.  Only complaint would be that the prices are on the high side, but clearly it is in exchange for an award winning chef and excellent servers.</body>

        <body>My husband and I had dinner for NYE and could not have been more pleased. Great oysters to start, but that&apos;s hard to mess up. Had the raw scallops and loved them, and the salmon terrine was remarkable. The grilled shrimp was also a lovely starter. For entrees we had the cod and the lobster special, both were great. The starters really stood out  for us, we were very pleased.</body>

        <body>We did not enjoy being rushed to eat our entrees which arrived at 7 pm.  Curtain was 7:30.  Our waiter had assured us when we were seated at 5:45 that there would be no problem making the curtain.  We ordered appetizers and one round of drinks but our server disappeared after delivering those.  We flagged down a bus boy to ask him for bread for the table, and that we needed to place our entree orders.  The arctic char and monkfish entrees were delicious-- very well prepared.  But their enjoyment was colored by the need to hurry to eat to get to our seats.  And of course dessert was completely out of the question.</body>

        <body>We started our evening off waiting for our table at the bar.  I loved the look of the place.  We were presented with a list of overpriced cheap wines.  We had a glass and waited.  After our table was ready we were seated and presented with several menus and my wife noticed there was no lobster.  The waitress told us that the monkfish was lobster like, so we order that along with the romaine salad.  The salad came out came out and my wife laughed. It was two pieces of romaine lettuce and a half of a poached egg. It probably cost them less than 60 cents for the whole thing.  Then came the monkfish, the smell coming from the platter was horrific. It was burned Brussel sprouts and a hunk white meat in the center.  I ate the monkfish and discarded the rest.  We decided to give them a shot a dessert.  We got the chocolate torte.  When we got the dish we started laughing again and wondering where the dessert was. The plate looked like someone had flung poo at it and wiped off the large chunk</body>

        <body>A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream and Sea Change all in one evening were a perfect pairing.  My daughter is a Shakespeare scholar and I love my daughter so what a better way to spend an evening.  I had so much fun having relaxing conversation with her away from the stresses of children and seeing her eyes light up being able to relax and talk about theatre.  The service at Sea Change was attentive yet respectful of our privacy.  I was able to watch my daughter, who appreciates quality food, be amazed by the creations coming out of the kitchen.  We started with one of the signature beverages of which she could not partake because she is pregnant but it was excellent...  it was the Raspberry Vodka based drink.    We moved on to a shared small plate of grilled octopus.  What can I say here?   Never having tried octopus before we were both in mouth heaven...   The texture was firm yet not chewy as I had feared it might be.  Nope, I was so wrong.  The grilling was to perfection.  The sauce, well, </body>

        <body>Our server and the menu were fantastic. That chef and kitchen know what they are doing. Every item we read we wanted to order and were not disappointed with anything we had (maybe the salad, not that it was bad, it just didn&apos;t hold up to the seafood items). Plenty of wine options. Its a big space but well decorated/themed throughout so the energy felt modern and romantic at the same time. We usually don&apos;t hit seafood restaurants, but will be back to Sea Change.</body>

        <body>I have been a Chicago Foodie all my life and Sunda is definitely a Top 3. No matter what the occasion, Sunda will not disappoint. Everything on the menu is simply divine and executed to perfection. In addition to the mind blowing orgasms erupting in your mouth with every bite, the cocktail creations of Nam are hands down the best in Chicago if not the entire country.</body>

        <body>Alison was a fantastic waitress, very attentive and knowledgable of menu and offerings. We had the seaweed  and kale salad. One of our favorites to have with sweet potato caterpillar. We are repeat customers and love Sunda for a special get together. Sunda never disappoints. The support staff is also friendly and I highly recommend this restaurant in the heart of Chicago.</body>

Our favorite shared dish of the day was lobster stuffed with Korean Bulgogi - very decadent. Absolutely will go again!</body>

        <body>The only positive aspect of our dinner here was the tiger shrimp tempura. The rest of our meal was cold when it wasn&apos;t supposed to be and the seafood wasn&apos;t fresh. The service was also beyond terrible. I&apos;m not usually one to complain but I was really disappointed with the experience and will never recommend nor dine here again. Save your money - go elsewhere.</body>

        <body>Drinks here are unusual and delicious and they have a nice sake and wine list as well.  Somehow champagne pairs well with Asian cuisine.  In any case our shisito peppers and the brussels sprouts appetizers were amazing as was the tofu dish they served.  We enjoyed salad, sushi and hot entrees as well and everything was cooked to perfection and plated beautifully.  We would highly recommend.</body>

        <body>We have had many wonderful evenings at Sunda, along with their great meals!  We always bring our friends, and our friends who are visiting from out of town here and everyone instantly LOVES it!  We order several plates to pass around and taste as well as the different sushi&apos;s on the menu…everything is always DELICIOUS!  Everyone leaves with a full tummy filled with Asian delights and we all go back for more!  This is a place that everyone should try, believe me, you will not be disappointed !</body>

        <body>This restaurant was recommended to us prior to our first visit, and it was a great experience. This is our second time dining there, and it was equally as great as it was the first time. The drinks and food are delicious. The service is excellent and ambience romantic with a young professional crowd. We&apos;ll definitely try to dine here during our Chicago trips.</body>

        <body>Sunda remains one of our occasional go-to spots for a nice evening out. The service is excellent and the ambiance is upbeat though too loud for those looking for intimate settings. The overall food experience is solid and I like that there are good land and sea options. Favorites are still the broccoli salad and pork belly.  The sushi experience is just okay though. If you&apos;re really going for high end sashimi and nigiri this would not be my first choice. The Maki rolls are good though nothing really jumps out. The prices are high and there are plenty of spots where the sushi variety and expertise is higher with more attractive prices. However, Sunda is going for a high end crowd who aren&apos;t concerned with $$. We will be back but not too soon.</body>

        <body>Took a group of 8 here on a recent business trip.  The service was quite good and the food was excellent.  Very nice variety of well prepared and creative food.    Noise level was a bit high the night we were there but we were in the back area which is much quieter.  If quiet is important to you I would request this area.</body>

I want to make special comment about the manager Richard Kim who went out of his way to accommodate  our larger group twice in one week, yes it was so good we had to go back again after two days. The entire menu is excellent, I honestly did not hear one complaint from our party of 7.  Two Thumbs up!</body>

        <body>I came here on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend and was very impressed with the food, service, environment and more.  Our waiter (I forget his name, but he had a British accent) was extremely knowledgeable and helped us with recommendations, as we wanted to try a little of everything but weren&apos;t sure where to start.  The brussel sprouts appetizer is a must-have - I know it seems odd, but this is one of their signature dishes and is delicious!  The lobster and wagyu sushi roll is also amazing.  Sunda is good for both date nights or group outings.</body>

        <body>Food was a great twist on Filipino fares, and other items as well.  We tried several items and shared amongst the group.  Steamed buns for an appetizer, followed by Pancit Canton, Crab Cake Benedict, Fried Rice with pork belly, and Brussel Sprout salad.  Dessert consisted of the day-special crème brulee and the Sunda Sundae (a twisted version of Halo-Halo).</body>

        <body>My boyfriend and i went here for valentine&apos;s day--and we couldn&apos;t have had a better time! He is not a fan of asian cuisine, so when i threw out sunda as a possibility i was pleasantly surprised when he agreed, and knew he was really only doing it because he wanted to make me happy.  And much to his surprise he loved EVERYTHING! and was talking about it days after!   i would say that this place is fit for foodies, and people who mostly subsist off of bar food as well.. a real crowd pleaser :)  we had the fire cracker roll, pangang chicken, beef lollipops, and garlic &amp; crab noodles.  we were stuffed and didn&apos;t finish everything, but it was all sooooo good!</body>

        <body>I love Sunda and have frequented many times. My last visit was for lunch with a group of 12 plus 1 baby. The pacing of the meal was a bit of a problem, however. 2 of us didn&apos;t get our main dishes until everyone else at the table had finished and one was given the wrong dish. The waiter apologized and gave the table 3 free desserts of his choosing (split between 12 people, only worked out to about 2 bites per person). It was a nice gesture, but several of our friends had to leave before the check came because the lunch had taken so long with the entrée problems and extended dessert time.</body>

        <body>The servers are very knowledgeable and helpful and since it is not your usual menu their help is essential to fully enjoying the meals.  This is a great place to try new things and most people will find an abundance of new item on the menu.  The quality is excellent and quantity is generous.  Overall a great casual dining experience. However we did find that the level of background noise seems quite high and a times interfered with our ability to carry on a conversation at the table.</body>

        <body>Food was decent - expensive but good.  For $9 a bite, it better be tasty.    Service - not so great.  Sit down, waiter asks, &quot;sparkling or still?&quot;  This is a pretentious question, in my mind (who actually drinks sparkling water in the United States??), and I am annoyed and say &quot;still is fine&quot;, figuring he would bring a Pinterest-shaped bottle of tap water that he would leave at the table.  He brings us an $8 bottle of &apos;premium&apos; (lol) water (which he opens out of sight), and starts pouring, knowing full well that we don&apos;t understand that we are receiving.  This is poor etiquette, especially at a nice restaurant (well, the prices would indicate &quot;nice restaurant&quot;).  Halfway through the meal, the waiter OPENS A SECOND BOTTLE WITHOUT TELLING US, and continues re-filling our waters.  $16 for &apos;premium&apos; water - without asking - are you kidding me???  This is bad form at best, and deceitful at worst.  The bill arrives, I put down a credit card and a gift card.  Waiter sees the gift card, asks </body>

        <body>In the past we really enjoyed Sunda.  But, we had a reservation on Friday night and we were told we could not be seated until our whole party was there.  The table was ready and we already went to the bar and got drinks.  My husband insisted that we be seated so we could have our drinks at the table and order an appetizer.  The wait staff was pleasant enough, but we still felt very rushed.  It was very loud which made it hard for visiting with our friends from Florida.  The food was just average too. I doubt if we will be going back.</body>

        <body>This restaurant is the most amazing place!! We drive approximately 2 hours (1way) to eat here. We recommend it to everyone. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. The Brussels sprout salad, kale salad, crispy rice sushi &amp; our favorite starter.........the spicy edemame.  We cannot wait to get back up to Chicago again. We will always dine at Sunda.</body>

        <body>Went with a group of 8 people. Had a reservation for 7and we were seated promptly. Our waiter was very helpful describing the items on the menu and gave us great advice about how many dishes to order and share. The food was all delicious. The dishes came out at a terrific pace. We tried 3 different sushi items, the lobster special that was stuffed with beef was fabulous and all the other items we ordered were prepared above and beyond the ordinary. Would definitely go back, it was fun to be with a large group so we could taste so many dishes. We were seated in a room in back with 2 other large tables. It was very noisy, in and out of the room.</body>

        <body>Been here over 5 times since it opened and never had time to visit much since I had a baby. Finally made reservation on valentines day with my husband and we missed the reservation by 16min. I told the 2 female employees that I was stuck in unexpected traffic and to please seat us. My RSVP was at 5:00pm and we arrived 5:16pm and they said we are too late and if we like we can sit by the sushi bar. I was over dressed and felt so embarrassed and told the woman to please seat us at a table and we would not take long. But she kept saying sorry I cannot. The place was empty and still treated us like garbage. So the other woman apologized and said we can sit at the lounge area. So I felt better and I really didn&apos;t want to ruin our night but this was way too embarrassing being all flamed up and basically getting kicked out. Very upset !</body>

        <body>Sunda was recommended to me by a friend. We took our friends from out of town. They loved it. The Sunda roll was so flavorful. We also had the lobster and wagyu roll. They are so good that you don&apos;t want to put the pickled ginger or soy on them. My husband doesn&apos;t like vegatables and he ate the Brussel sprout salad. It was. So delicious!!</body>

        <body>I went to Sunda for restaurant week with a colleague on 1/5.  The moment we walked in, the experience was disappointing.  I get that there are lunch rushes but I find it a bit silly to be seated 25 minutes after my reservation because the host was too overwhelmed.  The person checking people in or the manager should&apos;ve jumped in.  Everyone standing in the front was talking about it.  Then we get seated and it takes another 17 minutes to have our waiter come to us.  We order our food and I asked how the spare ribs were.  He said it was an excellent choice.   Our food came out quickly.  My spare ribs were not an excellent choice.  I could not eat them.  They were extremely fatty and dry.  It took forever to try to cut them off the bone and gave up after 2 of the 6/7 pieces I had.  The sushi and seaweed salad was good.  My colleague had the wrong sushi roll brought out.  Our waiter also never checked on us so we had to flag him down for the check and to let him know one of the orders wer</body>

        <body>I took my wife here fo a joined Christmas gift to us as we spent a weekend in the city. i had to make reservations a month in advance and it was well worth it. This place blew my socks off with the great food and nice wine list. we walked out stuffed and with the rest of a bottle of wine we didnt finish while sitting at the table. if you live in the city you must check this place out. If you dont i recommend spending a night downtown and dining at this fantastic place.</body>

        <body>The food is amazing and the service is fantastic. Try the brussels sprout salad, pear sake, Tail of two tunas, Pork Belly Dim Sum and Crispy tuna or Crispy Wagu tartar for sure. Everything is amazing! Perfect for two or 12, but don&apos;t expect to have an intimate conversation without talking over all the noise and close seating. I travel to Chicago 3-4 time a month and it is a must have at least on one of those trips. Make sure to use Open Table for the reservation or yo will never get in!!</body>

        <body>Keep an open mind and try everything or just let the server make recommendations. The Brussels sprout salad was amazing (it&apos;s roasted and warm). Crunchy bacon hidden lobster roll was great. Fun atmosphere and very knowledgable staff.</body>

        <body>The restaurant is great!  The food is fantastic. The menu is full of great choices. The servers were all very accommodating. The complimentary anniversary dessert was a nice touch. I accidentally knocked over my glass of water and the glass broke on the floor. The staff was quick to clean up my mess and it was almost like it never happened. That&apos;s awesome. Other than one little bit of confusion with the flower delivery, it was perfect!  I will go back!</body>

        <body>Sunda was a wonderful restaurant! I was very impressed with the knowledgeable, very attentive waitstaff. We received our food very quickly and our wine glasses were never empty. The quality of the food was phenomenal and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!  The only downside was the draftiness. Whenever the door would open there would be a cold gust of wind and made it a bit cooler than was comfortable.</body>

        <body>I haven&apos;t had a great sushi dinner for a while, and Sunda did not disappoint.  The ambiance was hip and modern, the service was amazing! I wish I remembered the name of our waitress because she was outstanding and completely friendly!  I would definitely come back for a special occasion, definitely not something I can do often, the prices are a little high :(</body>

        <body>Every time I go here the food is fresh and delicious. I haven&apos;t had a bad thing on their menu. The server was very freindly and helpful.  The drinks are also very good. My only negatives are the busboys hover around your table and when you finish one entree they swoop right in right before you are done and want to take the plates away. Also these have to be the most expensive drinks in the city outside of Trump. Other than that I love going to Sunda.</body>

        <body>Happening and lively for a Tuesday night when we visited. Most of the dishes on the menu are for you to share and are of varying sizes. Expect dishes to come out at different times. Menu had a number of things to choose from. Nice beer and wine menu. Food was good but nothing outstanding.</body>

        <body>My wife made reservations at Sunda on the recommendation of a friend. Our experience there was positive start to finish. She and I joined another couple. We ordered a wide variety of dishes to share and were not disappointed with any of them. The wine list was thoughtful, diverse and fairly priced. The space was beautiful. The service was attentive. The noise level was pretty high, but we were able to hear each other OK. I would definitely return.</body>

        <body>So since I&apos;m a  foodie and love to try different places on Chicago Restaurant week me and my friend went for lunch to Sunda. I saw several reviews of this place but this was my first time so i was kinda exited to try it out . Place was beautiful and I LOVED the decoration of the place. It look so modern and stylish. so we had for $22.00 soup, sushi, entree and dessert and I really cant not say nothing bad about this restaurant, service was good, people are very fashion since it is in downtown, food was amazing and the deal for that week even better. I had a steak and my friend a salmon and booth were yummy. def a great Asian bistro restaurant in downtown chicago.</body>

        <body>My boyfriend and I went here for early dinner and everything was great. We made reservations for 5 pm and when we arrived the hostess seated us right away. Once seated we didn&apos;t have to wait anytime for the server to arrive to the table. She was great with explaining the menu and making recommendations. We ordered several items from the appetizer and dim sum menu to try a little of everything. Our favorite was the oxtail pot stickers - a must try item !!! The drinks were also really good. While my boyfriend will try new things - he is very picky  - and he loved it!!!</body>

        <body>I went to Sunda for dinner on a Sunday night with very high expectations, so needless to say I was expecting everything to be outstanding. Not only were my expectations met, but I was completely blown away by EVERYTHING. To start, the ambiance was very modern and trendy, yet very comforting and welcoming at the same time. The design of the interior alone was a cool sight to see and very unique. Now for the food, I went with one other person and we got an appetizer (Duck Steamed Buns), two sushi rolls (Sweet Potato Caterpillar &amp; Red Dragon) , sashimi (Crab crusted Ahi Tuna, a hot entree w/side (Panang Chicken w/Duck Fried Rice), dessert (Sunda Sundae &amp; Chocolate Cake Special) and drinks (Strawberry Fields &amp; Peared Sake); all of which came out to being only $160 which is cheap given everything. Literally everything that we had was absolutely perfect and delicious and I would highly recommend everything that I listed. Last, but surely not least was the service. Our servers name was Kimbe</body>

        <body>Upon arrival, I checked in with the hostess and she had said that we would get seated closer to time of reservation (8:00) Around 8:15, my friend went up to the hostess and asked her when we would get seated. She said she did not see our party on reservations. I then spoke with her and with no apologies she bluntly said we did not have a reservation. If that were the case then why would she initially tell me that we would get seated closer to our reservation at 8.  She did not even acknowledge her fault and no apology and try to rectify the issue. Until I asked her if there was any possible way of seating us. She let us stand there not knowing what  to do and never looked at us upon conversation. Absolutely RUDE</body>

        <body>Sunda was reccomended by a friend and did not disappoint. The food was excellent, we ordered the Brussel salad- a must at Sunda, then we continued with the rolls. They were some of the best I&apos;ve had apart from the lobster bacon one. The server highly recommended that particular one as one of their signature rolls but I could have done without. That being said, everything else was above average. Great food great wine and excellent service. Do not hesitate to try.</body>

        <body>What a great place.  they make great food look easy but it&apos;s NOT. if you note the title I&apos;m a chef and what they make is just incredible. I have to say I at least eat there every few months but if I could I would go to Sunda everyday. I would highly recommend people to be adventureres and just kick back and let the witer/ waitress order for you. I do it everytime and i love it every time But I have to say I&apos;m very hard on the FOH staff but this place has a very well trained staff. I don&apos;t normal talk about servce but I would have to say Molly our waitress. she knew the right  to ask, when we need food, when we didn&apos;t, she even knew when we where full, our wine class and water every drop more then half. trust me once again people let the staff pick your food live outside of the box and they won&apos;t lead you down the wrong path. I go here every few months and been dinning her since the 2nd year they opened. And I still love it. over all I great pleace  and molly was great as well once aga</body>

        <body>Food was mediocre for the price. They tried to charge double because a roll was cut differently than listed on the menu. The waiter did not tell us this ahead of time. The manager did give us the roll for free due to the inconvenience. Overpriced.</body>

        <body>I took a friend here for his birthday.  Overall...we had a good experience.  The food was excellent...and the service good.  Unfortunately...we were placed at a table in the back...the 2nd time in a row I was stuck with this table.  It&apos;s in the corner where everyone passes you by for the kitchen and the restrooms...not relaxing at all.   Next time...definitely waiting for a better table.  The service was good...although our server was insanely busy...at times a challenge to get a drink.   At the end...the brought out a dessert for my friend&apos;s birthday...which was a very nice touch.</body>

        <body>We went with our waiter&apos;s recommendations and glad we did.  We had the Oxtail Potstickers, Tiger Shrimp Tempura, Duck Breast Kimchi, Pancit Canton Noodles and Signature Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna. All were exploding favors of Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Filipino cuisines! I grew up eating these foods and our dinner was no way near the best ethnic restaurants I have dined at. It&apos;s a little dimly lit and Contemporary Asian for decor. They have an outstanding Wine List and we loved the House Sake. Just don&apos;t overdo on the Sake.  It will catch up the next day!  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and service was excellent.  You can&apos;t possibly try everything, but this is a restaurant I know we would definitely come back to a couple more times.  I think it is populated by the 30 to 40 plus age group celebrating a night out.  Reservations are a must!</body>

        <body>I was very impressed with this modern Asian mashup.  We tried five dishes and all were extremely good.  Their specialty crispy brussel sprout salad was excellent, the lemongrass beef lollipops very good, as were the crispy rice sushi items, the crispy pata, and the basil shrimp roll.  It&apos;s not cheap but the food and service were worth it.  Go early if you want more tranquility as it gets crowded and noisy but there is a lot of energy in the place.</body>

        <body>We started at the bar, great service and great old fashioneds...highly recommend.  When we were seated at our table, it was 15 minutes before our server came to greet us.  He was very knowledgeable and food came quickly once we ordered, but we did not see the waiter nearly as often as I would have expected in this price point.  Outside of that, our food was fantastic!  The Brussel sprout salad is a must try.  Also enjoyed the oxtail potstickers.  We tried several sushi selections, all delicious.  Despite the hiccup with service, I would still recommend and will try again myself.</body>

        <body>It&apos;s too bad that the service doesn&apos;t complement the amazing food. For such a nice place, I&apos;m surprised at the lack of attention and slow pace of the service. Despite the really amazing food, this really killed the experience. Unfortunately because of this I would not go back to Sunda.</body>

        <body>You only get two peices of sushi and are essentially paying for the name of the restuarant.  The atmosphere was lively, but two pieces of sushi for about $15 each????  That is absurd!  We spent $14 on a small alcoholic drink and then another $25 on 4 SMALL rolls of sushi which was a BIG let down!  This restaurant was so busy I could barely hear my husband and our server only came to our table twice and when it came time to pay the bill she told me that I could use the whole $10 I had from a gift card for a tip for her.  This was not the case I am not going to tip 25% on service that recieves a 1 star rating.  We were still so hungry by the time we were done as I was not going to spend another penny on sushi just to get two peices!  We went to McDonalds after and were full from there.  Pretty sad when we have to resort to McDonalds to satisfy our appetites when I spend over $60 at Sunda.  I will not be back and will not recommend this place to anyone!</body>

        <body>Had a great time here. Service was excellent. Had the crab rice which had a very mild flavor, suited me fine as didn&apos;t overpower the other accompanying food. Oxtail potsticker was quite good and mushu duck was nicely cooked. Had 7 spice tofu cake which was ok and nice balance hot and spicy to cold ice cream on top of it</body>

        <body>The overall experience was great and the food was excellent. Couple things that were frustrating was trying to get seated. We had theater tickets and were seated 15 minutes after our reservation. Also the busboys had 3 issues: 1. Spilled water when filling a glass (it happens), but didn&apos;t even attempt to dry up and just left it there 2. Another time the person filled up a beer glass with water and the beer was not completely finished 3. Lastly took a plate away that still had a sushi roll on it (the server did credit us for this). The food though was excellent and would come back. We want to try brunch.</body>

        <body>The staff is very accommodating for gluten sensitivities. You MUST get the brussel sprout salad if visiting here. It&apos;s fried in the same fryers as the gluten-ized stuff so avoid it if you&apos;re celiac or super sensitive.   Service was a little slow to start on a Friday night at 7:30, but was much more attentive near the end of dinner.   It is VERY loud in here, so tough for big groups or if you really want to hear what your dining partner in crime is saying.</body>

        <body>Anytime my out-of-town guests visit, I take them to Sunda.  They always love the vibe,  beautiful people and tasty food.  The last time we went, a certain Chicago superstar athlete dined two tables away.  Good enough for him,  good enough for us :-)</body>

        <body>We had 3 couples and had a great time.  Dan was very familiar with the menu and made some great recommendations based on our reactions to certain items.  The drinks were an over whelming hit - recommend their Old Fashion if you like that sort of thing, but still want to taste a little bourbon.   The Sushi was great, a few combinations we were not expecting but it worked perfectly.  Curry had a kick and the lobster/crab (don&apos;t remember which) rice was a hit. There is a little noise with some EDM or pop music playing but the place was pretty vibrant.  Very busy for a Monday night.   We&apos;d recommend especially if you like Asian fusion/Sushi from other restaurants in this family.</body>

        <body>This was my second time here - coming all the way from Toronto, Ontario. The first time I came, the food was so delicious that I would crave it on random occasions back home. As soon as I found out I would be about 30 minutes outside the city for work last week, I immediately made a reservation for myself and a few others. It turned out only 2 of us came for dinner, but the food was exceptional, just as it was the first time I tried it. My co-worker was also highly impressed with everything she ordered. We would both absolutely go back if given the opportunity.  I am a VERY picky eater, and I must say, the brussels sprout salad is one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life. Atmosphere is lovely and the service was great. Both times the staff seemed to pride themselves on being extremely knowledgeable of every dish, which is such a hard thing to come by these days. I hope that one day a Sunda will open near the Toronto area! Very impressed! Wonderfully delicious! Perfect resta</body>

        <body>Excellent service at the bar, but that&apos;s where it ended. The cocktails were amazing, but once we were seated the service went downhill. The food was spectacular but kind of lost its appeal when two sushi rolls ordered at the same time came out almost an hour apart, and only after flagging down the server. The duck dim sum, sprout salad, sushi... Everything was delicious! Would have ordered more if had better service.</body>

        <body>The food was quite good.  The scene was about as pretentious and off-putting as I&apos;ve seen.  Not in a stuffy, old boys club, high brow way; but rather a very extra-arrogant brand of hipsterism (think Green Mill)  that this location has yet to earn the privilege of lording over anyone.  We&apos;ve been around the block and have seen many bad service industry folks, but this guy had the most awkward presentation I&apos;ve seen.  Period.   Besides the socially maladroit waitstaff, the hostess was far too busy chatting with her friend to even look at us, so we stood for some time in the front of the restaurant despite having reservations.   The food was above average, but jeez man, the cocktail list was so pretentious  that I laughed out loud reading the descriptions.  Table side mimosas mixing?  Really?   When I asked for a drink menu, I was smugly informed that there were three and I would have to narrow it down for him.  It just went down hill from there.  The odd thing was, the crowd didn&apos;t seem</body>

        <body>My husband and I went to brunch Sunda after reading about their Bloody Mary in the Thrillest.  Everything was really good and really prompt.  It turned out to be pretty much perfect for me (I was a touch hungover) b/c I don&apos;t think I could have eaten a super heavy American style breakfast.  Instead, we had dumplings, bao, ramen, and steak tartar sushi.  Everything was pretty good... I guess I&apos;d say that the ramen was only OK, but I was still pretty happy eating it.  My only real complaint is that I had tea that cost more than my husband&apos;s alcoholic beverage, which I found strange.  The service was good and prompt.</body>

        <body>We went to Sunda for a girls night celebrating a big birthday and had a great time!  The food was excellent, service was great and the atmosphere was fun!  I highly recommend the brussel sprout salad and I don&apos;t even really like brussel sprouts! The waitress recommended the salad and she didn&apos;t stear us wrong! There were even 2 Chicago Bulls players in the restaurant so great people watching!</body>

        <body>I have been to Sunda three times and have loved each visit as much as the last. The food is incredible; some of their plates are made up of combinations I could never dream up but they flow perfectly together. The lobster and wagyu roll is phenominal; you get new layers of flavor while you chew resulting in a true tasting experience rather than just a passively dining. The atmosphere is also engaging and each part of the restaurant offers a different scene, making it a great place for a romantic dinner for two but also a perfect place to dine with a large group. Obviously I cannot say enough good things about Sunda, you need to try it to see for yourself!</body>

        <body>Very unusual combination of ingredients in the makis.  Some work and some don&apos;t.  One wonders if the chef is willing to scarifice taste just to be creative.  Also,  I told them we were celebrating a birthday.  They reconfirmed that when they called to confirm the reservation.  Then they did nothing! Very disappointing.</body>

        <body>Try the Fois Gras!  Some very interesting and clever Tapas. Some, such as the Philly Cheese Steak are very tasty. Some are just regular tapas. All of this comes at a high price. Plan on 14 dollars to valet park.</body>

        <body>They have put in the bill two bottles of wine instead of one. Wine list is pretty limited, starting from 100 $ per bottle, but more likely 200-300 $. Food is good. Jamon and some other staff really outstanding.</body>

        <body>Any time you&apos;re in a city that has a Jose Andres restaurant, GO TO IT! The food was amazing. The plates are small, so it&apos;s a great way to sample a bunch of things. We were two people, and we ordered about 9 plates. We could&apos;ve ordered more, but glad we didn&apos;t because dessert was also a great mini sampler selection! Definitely worth a visit if you&apos;re in LA</body>

        <body>Although our waiter was nice and seemed genuine in trying to provide good service, he was unable to deliver as he had many tables. We kept trying to flag him down. He seemed to intentionally steer away from our table as the food was so slow to come out. We had mentioned in advance to the waiter and wine person that we were very hungry. We drank a full bottle of wine until our first batch of tapas came, which was only 1 at a time. Very sad for us starving party of fours. We brought a couple of us who has never been and was not impressed. We kept flagging someone for more a 2nd bottle of wine, which basically came by dessert and we were already disappointed and full of air in our tummy. It was a 3 hour dinner that should have only been 1.5 to 2 hours long. I am not sure I will come here with guests anymore. My husband and I will return only for the food and not for the service. The annoying part of it all is that we still tipped well, just because we always do. But isn&apos;t tipping suppose</body>

        <body>The food was excellent and a saving grace as the service was less than polished and easily the weirdest environment if ever eaten a meal.  We just kept asking ourselves, (huh?) The dessert area they invite you to looks like a series of bad bar mitzvah props and peep show items celebrating Halloween.</body>

        <body>Traveling from DC we made this reservation in advance after hearing about this restaurant -- the experience was amazing.  Innovative drinks and food. Of course their take on the Philly Cheesesteak is awesome! Be sure to grab a drink in their lounge before or after.</body>

        <body>Celebrated our 8th wedding anniversary with dinner here on the 9th of January and had a fantastic night. The food was spectacular, the service friendly and efficient and the atmosphere just right. Will recommend to any of my friends or clients travelling to Los Angeles to try and book in here for a dinner. Thank you for a memorable night and a great end to our holiday in the USA.</body>

        <body>Even though our reservation was for 10:15pm, the place was pretty busy and service could be a tad slow at times. That being said, everything we ordered was prepared perfectly and tasted delicious. It would be hard to find a bad thing on the menu. Well worth the cost, and a must-try!</body>

        <body>Food overall was outstanding but very pricey, even by NYC standards.  Our waiter was extremely pushy and up-sold us (and lied about portion sizes) to the point where we over-spent by at least $100 on food that we simply couldn&apos;t eat due to being so full.</body>

        <body>We took advantage of DineLA this week and had a really good time. The food was prepared well, very interesting and creative. The wine, however, tasted cheap. Service was friendly, but very disorganized. I will come back to try their regular menu soon. The fun atmosphere and interesting food is worth a return.</body>

        <body>Wow!  The Bazaar was recommended to me by a friend.  So glad we decided to take the recommendation!  This was one of our best dining experiences ever!!  Drinks were great (and fun)!!  Food was incredible (and fun!)!  Dessert was... eh, so-so.  The dessert itself was ok.  Service was extremely less than desirable, unfortunately.   We will DEFINITELY return, but we will skip dessert.</body>

        <body>I had very high expectations for Bazaar but was disappointed right from the beginning when my boyfriend and I arrived right on time for our reservation and weren&apos;t seated until 30 minutes later. (There was not a crowd at the door and a table of 8 who arrived after us was seated sooner). Then, our table was right by a junction where servers walked back and forth constantly and since the table was slightly too wide, we weren&apos;t able to comfortably lean forward to talk to one another.  I had high hopes for the dishes and we tried quite a few of the most interesting, like the fois gras cotton candy and the cheese steak. The majority of the dishes were good but they weren&apos;t so delicious that I thought it was worth the price. And for two of our seven dishes, we completely disliked them (the linguini and the uni ceviche)... which is not a fun feeling when it cost so much for a tiny plate.  Overall, I did not taste a single dish that I thought was good enough to merit the price for it and ther</body>

        <body>Recent dinner, we went for Traditional TAPAS.  The olives, cheese, octopus and chicken were outstanding.  It was the kind of moment where with each bite, your eyes open wide, followed by a smile, with a &quot;Wow, that&apos;s amazing&quot; kind of response.  Eager to return and work through the rest of the menu!</body>

        <body>My family recently dined at The Bazaar while on a holiday in LA as we had been the previous year on another trip. It was honestly one of the best meals/nights we&apos;ve had- even better the second time. Firstly the layout and design of the restaurant is extremely out-there and yes, very bizarre! This really adds to the atmosphere, making it a truly unique experience. We dined on a Saturday night when it was fully booked so it was very buzzy and energetic all night. The cocktails are also very modern and unique- a favourite is the magic mojito which they serve with fairy floss!   All the dishes sound mouth watering so it was difficult for the three of us to choose. We settled on 8 dishes between us which was just the right amount or possibly one too many. Highlights include the guacamole, croquettes, ottoman carrot fritters, ham board, caprese salad and the tortilla de patatas &quot;new way&quot;. Service was swift and staff were very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend a dinner here- unfor</body>

        <body>The Bazaar&apos;s highlight is the incredible food created by Chef Jose Andres and his staff. While we personally liked the &quot;traditional&quot; tapas offerings, the menu selection and wine list is wide enough to satisfy those who are not &quot;foodies&quot; or there to experience Spanish wines (as we were). Service staff were professional and prompt for most of the evening but as the crowds arrived, 8:00 pm or so, they were a bit overwhelmed.  The music was absolutely too loud! Noise it NOT what makes a restaurant a &quot;hot spot&quot;. It is the food that will keep customers coming back. In this situation, the food is perfect but we are not likely to return frequently due to the noise level. Cheers to Jose for the wonderful meal and Spanish wines that we absolutely enjoyed!</body>

        <body>As good as the food was, the dining experience and ambiance was better.  The quality of the food and presentation were outstanding but the real show is the unique use of molecular chemistry as most signature dishes and drinks were served smoking, cracking or just different than any other restaurant would serve.  Not a great value so be forewarned you&apos;ll spent quite bit but the experience is like no other restaurant you&apos;ll likely to visit.</body>

        <body>The Bazaar is an absolutely amazing restaurant! I came here for DineLA, but I would most certainly return even if it is not for DineLA. The service was amazing with the waiter being very attentive and always told us every detail about each dish that was served.  They serve some amazing dishes! I&apos;m sure many have said it, but it is worth repeating: order the Philly Cheesesteak. No really; it&apos;s that amazing. It looks like a small piece of bread with slices of beef on top, but in reality there is an additional amazing cheese sauce hidden away! The Braised Wagyu Beef Cheeks were delicious, especially with the ever so slightly hot red sauce. The Jicama Wrapped Guacamole was really an interesting dish. At first it looks pretty and solid, but when you pick it up, you better put it in your mouth or else it will fall apart. Another absolutely MUST get is the Traditional Spanish Flan; it is a rich, firm, great-tasting flan that was presented beautifully, so beautiful that I used that as my phot</body>

        <body>We went with the  Chef&apos;s tasting menu to be sure we could sample a little of everything on the varied menu and it was a home run.  Each plate caused us to &quot;oooo and ahhh&quot; over each bite of cerviche, beef, croquettas (we ordered a 2nd dish the 1st was so great), squid, homemade mozzarella balls &amp; a cool take on the ordinary mozzarella &amp; tomato dish.  We coupled everything with a complex and beautiful bottle of white wine.  Amazing and recommending by the wine sommelier. Dessert was offered to us in the &quot;dessert&quot; room.  Just like an adult candy shop, the desserts were on display to preview and look out on a long dessert bar.  What a COOL LA dining experience we happily shared with our two teenagers, boy 18 and girl 16.  They loved it as much as we did.  Happy eating!</body>

Service was very good and all of the waitstaff were very helpful and friendly, even escorting me to the &apos;hidden&apos; restrooms. I am happy I chose to eat here. I would come back again for the cheesesteak, jamon, and sauteed shrimp.  parking - metered, valet, or limited free parking after 6PM. Read signs carefully.</body>

        <body>Each of the tapas we tried was perfection and on the whole better than any other US tapas restaurant that I have tried. Even the traditional tapas were still inventive. All the dishes were complex and at the same time light. We only tried meat free tapas, but on the next visit, I will try some of the meat and fish selections which all sounded quite delicious. The service was very good, and the pace of the food arriving at the table was excellent. I have already recommended this restaurant to friends and family.</body>

Every dish was beautifully presented and interesting to the palate. The layout of the restaurant is a fun experience however the music, which gets louder as the night progresses robs one of the opportunity to enjoy a converstation with your guests.

        <body>By far the best dining experience we have had. The restaurant itself is beyond beautiful, the service received from the entire staff was impeccable and describing the food as incredible is a gross understatement. If you have the opportunity to go to this restaurant...GO!</body>

        <body>First time there and we will definitely be back. Service was impeccable, food excellent and atmosphere really fun and interesting. You could spend an hour looking at all the crazy paraphernalia! The tomato bread...I could live on it! Eggplant tempura is like clouds. Chocolate mousse...bits of salt and chocolate...wow.</body>

        <body>Jose Andres has created a restaurant that is an experience like no other.  The setting is beautiful, edgy, and futuristic with classic flair.  The food and drinks are unbelievable.  We couldn&apos;t believe the textures and flavors that we were experiencing.  It is apparent that effort to put attention to every detail is made.  Worth every penny!</body>

        <body>We celebrated an early Valentine&apos;s Day and it was an indescribable experience! The drinks are tasty and entertaining. The hostess acknowledge our early celebration and made us feel welcome. Our waitress and staff team where all excellent. The food was unbelievable and the atmosphere was amazing... Definitely one of the best places My Lady and I have ever been to... We both enjoying trying new restaurants and foods; Bazaar is definitely at the top of our list. We can’t wait to return…</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve wanted to try this place for about 5 years, and I&apos;m so glad I finally did! the only downfall was our hostess experience. My boyfriend and I arrived 15 minutes early, and after waiting for over 30 minutes (15 past our reservation time) we asked the status of our table. We were told they though we were only &quot;partially arrived&quot; which I think was the first excuse they could come up with for forgetting about our reservation. Aside from this, the service and food were amazing! Our server was very knowledgable and helped us figure our way out around the menu. The smoked yellowtail, seared scallops and steamed oxtail buns were a few of my favorites. I can&apos;t wait to go back!</body>

        <body>We waited almost an hour after our reservation time to be seated.  No apology.  Service has gone downhill.  Our waiter was average to good; a couple of the food servers/bringers were obviously BORED, reciting the dish and ingredients with no interest. Thank goodness for Jorge who  was cheerful and stellar!!!</body>

        <body>The drinks and the food are incredibly imaginative and amazing.   I had the smoke on the water scotch and absolutely loved it.   The food was creative and delicious and it was fun to try so many dishes.  It was unusual to leave your table and go to a new area for dessert, but it was fine.  Expensive but so much fun!</body>

        <body>Great experience! Strength is on meat,  very savory, perfectly cooked with wonderful presentation.  Phylly cheesesteak a must, risotto with truffle was on spot. The bread with egg and ham dish was wonderful. It, the bread, is almost as crispy and light as the one we had in Toledo, Spain, at Aldolfo, where we had the best bread ever....  Drinks are expensive. The waiter was a bit tricky on the offer of water. He did not mention tab. Just flat or fizzy water.  So, for 4 of us, we paid $24 for 2 bottles of flat water beyond our specialty drinks and wine. Not necessary!!! And he skipped his promise, with a shady excuse, to serve our desserts in a separate area, as he advertised at the beginning. He was a little to smooth, too slick and too tricky. But now we know all the tricks, well, almost all. We will come back for the food, not the drinks and with our guards up...</body>

        <body>A must experience kind of place. Wasn&apos;t as expensive as I originally feared, but boy the portions are tiny.  A lot of the food is visually impressive &amp; the taste experience with the way some of the foods  are concocted most unique. The only problem was that once you take away the visuals, take away the uniqueness of it&apos;s preparation. You realize that the actual taste of the food is just O.K.  I mean it&apos;s definitely good. But take away all the smoke &amp; mirrors &amp; it doesn&apos;t match the hype.</body>

        <body>It was a great place to go and everyone in my party enjoyed the food. the server would be gone for a while- but he was very nice. The dessert room was a weird touch. I didn&apos;t really like eating near the museum/store- it felt weird, but I get it. I wish the dessert was a little more interesting like the dinner. Overall great experience and I would recommend to anyone.</body>

        <body>I&apos;d like to start by saying that this restaurant has a brilliant reputation and I was very much looking forward to coming here. I was sad to say that it&apos;s quite a let down and the complete experience was nothing special and to add to the disappointment the flood felt forced and overdone, some was undercooked and the general dining experience can be replicated at a much higher level at many other LA restaurants. In my opinion this is not a good restaurant, it&apos;s completely overpriced and all in all I left feeling let down. Hopefully others experience is better than mine but I will not be returning.</body>

        <body>Great night, we took our 11 year old son, who is an adventurous diner. We are repeat diners and he was fascinated with the modern tapas and a virgin drink that was fun! Some of the traditional tapas are underwhelming, but the modern ones are fresh and inventive.</body>

        <body>It was our first time being seated in the Rojo section, which was noisier than we remember the Blanca section being.  Service was very good - they managed to be very helpful and attentive without being bothersome -- always a tough balance to strike. We greatly enjoyed the croquetas de pollo, the Catalan spinach with praline sauce, the Jamon Iberico con huevos, the Japanese baby peaches with burrata and of course the Bazaar&apos;s take on the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich.  Remember to save room for dessert!</body>

        <body>food was mediocre, for that price i would expect great or surprising food. but they were either tasteless or just soso. normally for fine dining restaurants like this i would tend to give it another try to see maybe i missed something on their menu, even though between the 2 of us we did order 8 tapas and 3 desserts plus 5 glasses of wine each. BUT with that HORRIBLE SERVICE of this restaurant, I  will not come back again nor would i recommend it to anyone. If you are smart, spend your money elsewhere for better service.</body>

        <body>We had our anniversary dinner here this last weekend and tried this place due to a friend&apos;s recommendation. Well he was spot on. The food was great. For a couple you must order between 6-8 of the dishes. Must have items are definitely the Spanish Iberian ham plate, grilled octopus, cotton candy fois gras and the cheesesteak sliders. After dinner you must definitely transfer over to the dessert room. What a great set up. Allows for chatting and delicious desserts along with a fine espresso or cappuccino. We will be back.</body>

        <body>This is a fantastic place for brunch.  Their slections are quite extensive so that everyone can find something to satisfy them.  I tell my friends about it, and when out of town friends come to town this is where I take them for brunch.  I will keep going there.  My favorite brunch place!! Amazing!</body>

        <body>I have chosen the Clubhouse for years for a great place to eat.  There were tasty choices and moderate priced menu.  We ordered the desert sampler at the end of the meal.  A great ending to a great meal.</body>

        <body>The Clubhouse has been one of my favorite Restaurants in Oak Brook: I could always count on great service and outstanding food quality. Unfortunately not this time... I had my friends and their child to join us for dinner. We were sited promptly, in lower level as requested. The restaurant was not busy. We were never offered water or bread. Waited drinks and food extremely long time. Finally got water and bread from the busboy after asking the food runner for it (20 min. after sited..). We have been waiting extremely long time for the meal. My husband ordered 16 oz. Prime Rib, and at least 8 oz. was just fat. He usually orders Prime Rib when dining in the Clubhouse or Gibson&apos;s, and this was really not up to standard piece of meat. I noticed that the table next to us had the same order and I overheard them  talking about the poor quality of the meat as well. My 10 years old ordered Medium Filet sliders and the meet was overcooked and dry...The server was nice but it looked like her sec</body>

        <body>When making the reservation, I specifically asked for a quiet booth, as I planned on dining with friends I haven&apos;t seen in a while.  We hoped to enjoy a leisurely dinner and catch up on each others&apos; lives.  I really appreciated it when the Clubhouse called to notify me that 2/6 is a &quot;First Friday&quot; .  As such the first floor has a party atmosphere.  Lots of dancing, loud music, etc.  The person who called said that dinner guests would be seated upstairs, where the noise level was  lower.  But he wanted me to know in advance.  Because my friends were coming from all over, I decided it would be easier to take a chance and keep the reservation than to organize a change of venue.  I was pleased to find out that, as I asked, we were given a booth as far away from the noise as possible!  It was still livelier than we wanted, but I can&apos;t complain about it. Our server was fantastic -friendly,  pleasant, attentive, etc.  I was slightly disappointed with the food tho.  I ordered the filet mignon</body>

        <body>Seating on the main floor had a draft which made your food cool faster than normal. The seating was a bit cramped. The food was good but average. The desserts were huge and fun to eat and share with people at your table. I had the Shrimp and Lobster Risotto. I understand aldente but the risotto was a little but more than aldente, it was hard. The Lobster Bisque had a nice flavor, but to thick; almost like a gravy. The risotto and bisque had the same flavors, like the same base was used in creating both dishes. My husband had the jambalaya which was spicy with a good flavor however, it had no body or balance. The spiciness was sharp (lack of a better word to discribe the spice) and over powered the dish.    There is a bathroom upstairs which I perfer. It&apos;s larger with more bathroom stalls. I actually would have perferred to eat upstairs. The space was more open and the noise level was lower than downstairs sitting. I came here some years ago for the Sunday Brunch. In my opinion I will </body>

        <body>I&apos;ve had many good meals at The Clubhouse, but this one was incredibly subpar.  Service was very slow and not as good as usual.  Two hamburgers were each ordered medium rare, but were served medium well to well done.  They were also luke warm at best.  The steak was also overcooked and did not arrive hot.  For $31, I expected a better cut of meat.  It had too much fat and inedible gristle.  When I attempted to point out the problems to our server, I was ignored and got no apology or response of any kind.  The fries also appeared and tasted like they had been sitting too long.  By the time my requested extra salad dressing arrived at the table, I was almost done with my salad.  What should have been a 45 minute to 1 hour meal took an hour and a half or more.  It left us no time to order dessert, which we always enjoy.  This is the first time I have experienced such a poor meal at The Clubhouse, as it is usually very reliable.  I hope the quality and service is not declining, and that t</body>

        <body>We normally go to the Clubhouse at least 5 times a year. This is the first time we did  go for Valentines Day. It was, as usual, a very nice dinner. We sat on the lower floor, and despite that the noise was not too unbearable. Food was good as usual. The wait staff was very attentive. I believe her name was Kate. She engaged us in conversation and was very knowledgeable with the food selections for that day. I would have tried the Couples dinner but since I do not do seafood much, I opted out of that. We had a great time and can&apos;t wait to return-----soon. Thanks.</body>

        <body>For the price it was sad, selection was okay at best. Dining room was very tight, should use the entire Resturant for brunch. Would not return for brunch. Pecan french toast was good, if you were luckily enough to get one that&apos;s was hot. The hostess on the first floor was very snobbish.</body>

        <body>We LOVE the Clubhouse in Oakbrook. We have dined there for years and are never disappointed. However, the Easter Brunch was expensive, the food was not that good and we left disappointed.   We will be back, just not for brunch.</body>

        <body>It was my birthday dinner and we had a very pleasurable evening, thanks Clubhouse.  There was ample parking and our table was ready in keeping with our reservation time.  Truly came across as a well run machine.  Our waiter was Chris who was excellent, attentive, informative.  Parking was ample, timeliness of staff and service were very good.</body>

        <body>Usually, I highly recommend the Club House, but this year, I felt that my experience was hindered since our table seemed to be thrown into an aisle to fit more people into the space. It was very uncomfortable to have people constantly moving around me. I watched another family ask to be seated somewhere else when they were given a similar table and wish we had asked as well. At nearly $50 /person for brunch, was also sad to find that aside from soda and iced tea, no beverages were included so had to pay extra for hot tea after being seated in a freezing cold area of the restaurant. Tea was cold in minutes - and server never offered additional hot water and rarely came to check on us.</body>

        <body>There were four of us women who needed a nice place to celebrate a 50th birthday.  This was a great place to do this as we weren&apos;t bothered by a server who interrupted our conversation.  The food was very good however we were seated quite a distance from the buffet and it felt odd to negotiate tables and others walking Round to get back and forth to our table.  Not a real cozy place either.  The food was decent. Kinda pricy at $30 per person but overall it served our purpose.  Don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll return.</body>

        <body>I was not impressed with their Easter Brunch.  I expected more selection for $48.00 per person.  They charged for everything.  Juice  and a cup of tea was an extra charge.  The food was not that good.  If you wanted the prime rib you had to take it as it was prepared which was very rare.  We do not like rare meat.  The servicer was nice but not that attentive.  It was over an hour drive to get there and definitely not worth it.  We will not be returning.</body>

        <body>The steaks were not good at all...especially for the price. I like my steaks medium rare so they are juicy and flavorful. There was no juice in my steak or even on the plate when I cut into it. Must have changed cooking technique?? Not good at all especially when charging $40 and up for their steaks. The desserts were wonderful, though. I was surprised we weren&apos;t happy with this meal since I&apos;ve been here before and my husband comes for lunch more frequently.</body>

        <body>We had specialty menu needs which were met quickly.  The server was helpful, attentive but not overbearing.  There were 4 of us and all of us thought our meals were excellent.  However, a little pricey, especially the sea bass which is quite a small portion for the large price.  Overall, I always am pleased with all aspects of dining at the Clubhouse.</body>

        <body>My quiet Sunday night dinner would have been fine, had I not felt uncomfortable with almost every member of staff pointing at me. I look very young, but that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m not over 21. There is clearly a lack of communication between staff members. I think what&apos;s worse is the fact my server had a conversation about me with the table next to us. A woman was quite upset and goes there is no way he is 21, he walks with the woman out of my earshot and they proceed to have a conversation about me. I have eyes, when your looking and pointing at me I know you are talking about me.  My server ruined my night. He should have directed the lady to his manager. He checked my ID, before serving me. As for the other members of staff, in particular the blonde lady, save your pennies for some Botox  I&apos;m sorry that God has rewarded me with a youthful looks for not judging, maybe you should do the same.</body>

        <body>We are frequent visitors to the Clubhouse.  We like it because the food and service are great and there are lower cost items compared to some of the other local Oakbrook restaurants.  As usual, service was great and food was as expected.  The shrimp coctail was very overpriced -- shrimp were small.  Our wraps were great.  It&apos;s ridiculous that the wraps are $13 and the crappy shrimp coctail isn$16!  After we paid our bill we decided we wanted to have some drinks at the bar to watch the Blackhawks.  The bartender was TERRIBLE... Unattentive, rude...Won&apos;t make the mistake of going to the bar again!</body>

        <body>The four of us in the party had reservations for the 11:15 AM seating on Christmas Day.  We were shown to our seats on the second floor immediately.  The buffet, especially the meat and fish offerings, was outstanding.  The portion size enabled us to taste just about everything.  And I haven&apos;t mentioned the fine carving tables and the oyster and shrimp bar.  Finally the dessert table was elegant.  It was hard to choose what to sample so we each took different desserts and shared with each other.</body>

        <body>One of our group is gluten free and it was her choice to go to The Clubhouse.  They had a separate gluten free menu which was nice, but charged her $2 for a small piece of gluten free bread with butter.  Everyone enjoyed their drink selections and food selections.  I wish they had more vegetarian options on the menu.  Overall, it was an enjoyable experience.</body>

        <body>The Club House is a great restaurant for family and friends. We had a great time this first Friday. The food and drink was so good!  Only problem is on first Friday need to be in a bigger room because it was a very big crowd. We had so much fun dancing and eating.</body>

        <body>We come to the Clubhouse every March for our birthdays.  There are three of us.  We come for the brunch and we will probably come back at least once for dinner.  It is a little noisy at brunch but dinner is very low key and elegant.</body>

        <body>We went with another couple for dinner on Valentine&apos;s Day.  They we were running late.  The hostess said she&apos;d hold the reservation and just to tell her when our friends arrived.  They joined us a half hour late.  She was very accommodating.  We had a great meal, priced fairly in a comfortable table.  Overall, a wonderful experience.</body>

        <body>My husband and I dined here on Valentine&apos;s day. Despite other reviews I had read, there were plenty of parking spaces available (there is also valet parking). The service was excellent and the courses were extremely timely without being forced or rushed. The bread, cocktails, and salads were delicious. I agree with other reviews that the lobster bisque is a must try. My steak was cooked perfectly and was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The only thing we weren&apos;t over-the-moon about was the creme brûlée, which seemed overcooked. We were seated in a very quiet and private area by the windows and had a very wonderful evening.</body>

        <body>Food choices and taste are still very good although it was odd that the dinner specials were really lunch sandwiches.  However, the restaurant has had a problem with food temperature in the past year or so - the food just isn&apos;t hot enough. And given the service level and the way the restaurant is managed, it&apos;s just not worth the hassle of sending it back.  Not sure why it has to be this way but if you spend $40 for a steak, it may just be lukewarm.  The hostess staff was deplorable on our last visit.  Every table offered was sub-par and they just didn&apos;t understand the notion of what a special celebration is. I spoke to the manager who failed to comprehend the situation and did absolutely nothing.  Frankly, I&apos;m not inclined to return and plan to take my business elsewhere.    The restaurant was crowded for a change on a Saturday night (something that hasn&apos;t been the case for 2 years) which likely contributed to the poor service and lack of organization.  In years past, this place ran l</body>

It made it extremely noises and nearly impossible to talk to others at our table. If the took just a few less reservations so that the tables could be spread out just a little more, it would make the overall experience a lot more enjoyable.</body>

        <body>The Clubhouse was great, our server was attentive and friendly.  He didn&apos;t mind answering all our questions....a BIG PLUS and great surprise was delivering the birthday dessert on a plate lettered with Happy Birthday, a candle AND a picture of everyone at the table AND having the photo available online for sharing via email! -- food was good....the only issue was the restaurant was cold -- I know it&apos;s hard to keep it warm on a day when it&apos;s 5 degrees outside, but bring a sweater, you&apos;ll need it!</body>

        <body>My only concern was that I requested a table close to the brunch because I have problems walking. The first table would have been close to the brunch but I would have had to walk up two steps and down two steps. The next table was a distance from the brunch, so my friend had to get my food.  Elevator was also out of service so we had to use the freight elevator.  The service was great, out server, Frank could not have been nicer and very attentive. The food was great as usual.</body>

        <body>The brunch was tasty.  I was seated downstairs and was cheated on the ambience.  This was the first time I didn&apos;t sit upstairs for brunch.  It was like a cheaper version from presentation and variety but overpriced. I will not return for a holiday but I would consider a regular Sunday. Sad and disappointed being a long term customer since they opened.  Not worth  $48/person for a fuzzy picture with a bunny but had a great waitress.</body>

        <body>Even though I made a reservation, they sat us in the back of the first floor at a crowded table right by the bathroom.  It took 15 min before she took our drink and appetizer order and another 15 before she asked if we wanted to order our main entrees -- clearly overcrowded and non attentive.</body>

        <body>I&apos;m just gonna use bullet points to keep this neater. Management would not budge on making an exception for a pre fixe valentine&apos;s day menu for a customer who was allergic to seafood.   Medium rare prime rib ordered, I  given a well done filet mignon. Girlfriend waited while they brought new plate.   Girlfriend given a burnt filet mignon instead of a medium filet. Server apologized and brought out a new steak but then I waited for her food to be brought out. When they brought out her food they forgot her vegetable and silverware. Had to wait longer for that.   GM came to speak to us, offered free drinks and appologized. We accepted the drinks, placed the order, finished dinner and never got  drinks! Why would you offer something and not follow through?!!!  I complained to manager again. Food was comped and a gift card was given but we still never got the drinks!   I normally would not complain about a free meal but it was valentine&apos;s day and the whole ordeal took about 2 and a half ho</body>

        <body>Food came out cold. The server apologized and literally brought our food right back out (microwaved it). Sorry but I don&apos;t want to pay $30 a dish for food that has been microwaved. Not to mention my boyfriends steak was ordered medium rare and when it came back out (after being nicriwaved) it was medium. Never going back.</body>

Good setup with two sides mirroring one another so no long lines. Service was outstanding considering the crowd. Would recommend.</body>

        <body>This was our first time to this restaurant, it was a bit loud or how they call it energetic, just something to consider, at the same time, the food was outstanding, we had reservations for 7:00pm. I had to call that we were running late, they were great in accommodating to our need for extra time. Everything was great, it was not as romantic as expected, but still we had a great night and will be back again!</body>

        <body>We should have known it was going to be a bad experience when we pulled up to the restaurant and lights were blazing from a fire truck and ambulance at the front door.  We had reservations for 6:45pm and were seated about ten minutes after our time.   The waiter started off okay, but then proceeded to ignore us for most of the evening, and then didn&apos;t bring us part of our order, even when a reminder was provided that they had forgotten to serve us.  The food was bland at best.  We have been coming to this restaurant for many years and just don&apos;t think we will return after this horrible experience.</body>

        <body>Our server, Frank, provided the best service, attentive without hovering!  The steak was wonderful.  The sea bass was cooked perfectly but the sauce that accompanied it was a nothing special teriyaki which was a bit disappointing.  The chocolate lava cake was delicious!  Overall, a great dinner, but Frank was definitely the star!</body>

        <body>Been to the Clubhouse mostly for lunch, but wanted to try dinner with friends.  We all the loved our choices from filet medallions to their special lobster risotto.  Buffalo shrimp appetizer was also delicious.  Even had dessert- which was a huge bowl of ice cream, cookies and brownies.  Enough for 4 people but my husband ate a lot of it himself.  Would definitely return for dinner.</body>

        <body>We arrive at 7 pm for 7:15 reservation, we did not get to our table until 7:35. One of the worst service I had ever experience until we ask the Manager to get us another server. The first server was very rood and slow. He got our drinks at 8:25 and forgot couple of them. One of our guests he did not get his martini until 8:45 and that was the wrong drink. When the server finally ask to take our order I ask for soup and salad and he told me that I have to wait until I will get my appetizers first? Second server did a good job serving us. I am sorry but when I spent $680 included gratuity in any dinning establishment for 6 adults and 2 teenagers I was expecting better results.</body>

        <body>There are a few top notch servers at the Clubhouse.  If you don&apos;t get one, it is a different experience--and not in a good way.  Christmas Eve was one of those nights.  Our server seemed less than enthused to be waiting on us.  Our food was, at best, OK.  I got a &quot;Delmonico&quot; ribeye that was so salty it was hard to eat.  Ordered it medium rare and it was more like medium well.  Not a good experience.  Our visits to the Clubhouse have declined as the prices have continued to climb and the food and service is best remembered from days past.  The wine list remains that same as it has for years and wines offered by the glass are mediocre (at best) and overpriced for sure.  I think it&apos;s time for the Clubhouse to do a makeover.  My $.02.</body>

        <body>Most of my visits have been for the Sunday brunch on special occasions. Every time, it&apos;s always worth the trip out from Chicago.  The servers are attentive even though it can get really busy, the food selection and quality are excellent. More than I usually spend per person, but reasonable for the experience.  I am glad that there are at least a couple of vegetarian options on the regular menu, but I would not go out of my way for them like I do the brunch.  Still good to know if in the area with other people.</body>

        <body>We went to the Clubhouse to celebrate my birthday, a tradition I&apos;ve had for the last seven years. It usually is a great time and the restaurant recognizes your birthday with a nice dessert.   This year I was severely disappointed on so many levels. First, when they called to confirm I told them it would be my birthday and asked them to put a note with the reservation.  When we checked in, no recognition from the hostess anout the birthday and we were made to wait for 10 minutes while others who came in were immediately seated. Finally, another hostess asked whether we had been helped and then told us our table had been ready. It was apparent we had been neglected. I mentioned this to the host on the second level and expressed my displeasure and he told me he would address it with the hotness.   We had a great meal and I told my server we were there to celebrate my birthday. The waiter mentioned that the kitchen would prepare a special treat (the dessert). This was apparently forgotten</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been here many times and have had excellent service and food. But this particular night it seemed like everyone of way off his game. The food was poor. The service was poor. The busboy left dirty plates on our table the entire meal. The only redeeming factor was that I had money on my Valued Member card the the meal was not expensive.</body>

        <body>My wife and I went to The Clubhouse on a very busy Valentine&apos;s Day.  Overall, our impression was that they did the best they could, and there was room for improvement.  We had an 8:00PM reservation and were delayed by about 15 minutes because the restaurant was running behind.  We went to the bar to get a drink, and the bartender was quite frazzled and the day was getting to him.  When we got to the table, the server was very friendly and helpful.  However, she gave us more time than necessary to decide on our order - probably due to running around checking on the high volume of other guests she had.  Food was OK, nothing spectacular, but nothing bad to say about it.  I had Prime Rib, and my wife had a pasta dish.  Both came out hot and were good...however I never got the horseradish I ordered...twice.  If this were any other day, this would be a completely different review - but I am giving a bit of leeway due to the particular night we went.  We might try The Clubhouse again, but co</body>

        <body>Everytime we come here, we are completely satisfied. Food is always good. Drinks are delicious..and if you aren&apos;t happy with something, they will fix it so you are. Although it&apos;s upscale, they are children friendly. They immediately bring out crayons, color sheet, and a plate of fruit and crackers for our child..everytime. This means alot bc at many restaurants I have to bring a bag of things to occupy my child. But here they are prepared. Love this place.</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve come here for the last two years for Christmas brunch.  Service was very good and attententive, especially considering that this was a brunch.  Good food and a decent number of selections.  The atomophere is a comfortable, slightly upscale with festive decorations.  Great option if you don&apos;t want to cook on Christmas.</body>

        <body>I know it was New Years Eve but that does NOT excuse cold food, overwhelming noise and the overcrowding ( you could barley get to the bathroom.  The service was good and fast, almost too fast as we felt very rushed.  The foursome at the next table spoke in moderate tones but the foursome two tables were rude and obnoxious, using vulgar language and speaking at the top of their lungs.  We may try them again on a less crowded night and order off of the menu rather than their &quot;special&quot; dinner.</body>

        <body>Experience was OK - 1-2 service blips, but recovered.  We had very senior moms with us and I think  I will not do that again - restaurant is not geared that way- which is fine - will just remember that for the future.</body>

        <body>While we looked forward to a nice evening out and a gentle conversation we ended up being put in a closed room with a group of 16 teenagers for a Sweet 16 Birthday Party - my bad. Should have requested on Open Table when booking our reservation I wanted a quiet remote area.</body>

        <body>My friend and I had a wonderfully, delicious meal after an afternoon of enjoying th mall. Had reservations and it was nice to come in and not wait to be seated, as that sometimes happens at other restaurants. The bread was sooo good, the food was hot and our waiter was attentive.  Would go again!</body>

        <body>This is a great place for brunch with your family! The wait staff was outstanding and friendly. The wait wasn&apos;t long as far as having reservations. The food was the best &amp; fresh in my book it&apos;s a 5 star all around!</body>

        <body>My husband and I had an early dinner here on a Sunday around 4.  When we arrived it seemed a little...disheveled.  Most of the upstairs was empty, just a few leftovers from brunch/lunch.  We were seated downstairs near the bar area.  Surprisingly there were several families with several kids.  One set was running around while their parents enjoyed their dinner, making it feel a little more like McDonald&apos;s than a nice restaurant.  The waiter was great, very attentive and helpful with suggestions.  We both ordered the drink special and figured out the smaller price meant a smaller pour.  We were much happier with our second drinks, which were not on special.  We both had our own wedge salad, but probably could have split as the portion was generous...seemed strange that they charge extra for bacon bits because I thought that was part of a wedge salad.  I ordered a seafood and chicken pasta which was served very hot, but lacked seasoning..I was not offered fresh pepper or parmesan when i</body>

        <body>We have been to The Clubhouse several times in the past on New Year&apos;s Eve and always experienced great food and service.  This year the food was outstanding but the service was much less than expected.  It&apos;s still a very nice restaurant and we will go again because this is the first time we had such awful service.</body>

        <body>As always, The Clubhouse never fails to please. The menu is great, with a broad spectrum of choices, from sandwiches to prime steaks. On this evening, they also featured an additional fixed price menu for couples, which was really quite a value. The service was welcoming and friendly, from everyone we came in contact with.  I truly enjoy dining here and would go more but for the fact that we live quite a drive away.</body>

        <body>The Clubhouse never disappoints! The food is always prepared perfectly and portions are generous. Personally, I go for the lobster bisque and stay for everything else.  Valentine&apos;s weekend offered a nice package dinner for two as well as a lobster tail special and a prime rib special which my husband enjoyed.  My son ordered the tuna tartar appetizer which is served with two very delectable sauces.  While the desserts have remained the same for as long as I can remember, the variety prevents disappointment.  The only drawback at the Clubhouse is parking.  Well...that is to be expected at Oak Brook Mall.</body>

        <body>Had 7:00 reservations Saturday, seated right away.  Overall, very good, but our server appeared to be stretched too thin, our drinks kept running out.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke appetizer – they flamed it tableside, the description didn’t say anything about that.  In that no one was drinking, we didn’t appreciate putting alcohol on an appetizer.   Besides our waiter, service was good.</body>

        <body>My husband and I went to Christmas Brunch 3 years ago with a positive experience. The focus of The Clubhouse now is to get as many people in as possible during all seatings. The bar was reduced to 1/3 the space with the rest of the bar turned into a buffet line. The result was lobby area now crowded with guests entering, guest leaving and guests fill full plates weaving amoung every one. There were 2 seats for guests that were waiting. Upstairs the effect was the same with tables crowded so closely together I could not find a seat at our table for four where guests at other tables were either at my elbow or knocking into the back of my chair when they moved. Buffet lines suffered from the numbers of guests with dirty serving spoons and crowded line. Just not worth $50 per person.</body>

        <body>The Clubhouse has been a go-to restaurant for us for many years.  We always enjoy the excellent food and excellent service.  We especially like the way they cook meat and fish.  This time we had Prime Rib and it was perfect.  The ambiance and service are also consistently excellent.</body>

        <body>Amid the hectic holiday schedule, my husband and I found time to take advantage of our Anniversary coupon and dined alone at the Clubhouse.  It was a wonderful dinner, food was great and we had great service.  After waiting on everyone this holiday, this was a wonderful experience.</body>

        <body>Service is second to none!  We have been here often, especially for Easter Brunch.  They pay a high attention to details.  Server was there when we needed her, even though it was a very busy day.  My only gripe, and this is very minor, they should have sugar-free syrup available.  Normally we bring some to accommodate one the family members that is a diabetic.  And if you have kids at dinner time, they do a nice little &apos;plate&apos; crackers, banana&apos;s, oranges and such.  Keeps the little ones busy while dinner is on the way.    Absolutely one of our first choices when we dine as an extended family.</body>

        <body>They always have interesting drink specials and the menu is a nice selection of American food that virtually anyone could find at least one thing to order--if you have any picky eaters in the bunch.  Nice ambience--not stuffy but a slight upscale feeling.  The décor reminds me of an Alice in Wonderland scene.  It&apos;s one of our &quot;go-to&quot; places when you want a bit nicer atmosphere but still feel fine wearing jeans if you&apos;d like.</body>

        <body>I booked  table for 7 for the Clubhouse Christmas buffet as I&apos;ve eaten here plenty of times on random days and their food/service is always great. We took the last reservation time slot of the day at 4:45 so it could be more of a dinner stop then brunch. We were there on time yet had to wait 30 minutes for a table. Management sought us out to apologize and offered us a round of drinks on the house while we waited. A very nice gesture, but once we finally got our table and walked over to get food there were no plates anywhere in sight so we had to wait again. Then we got plates and literally the first 3 dishes of food we opened were empty. By the time we started eating and went up for seconds we discovered they were starting to clear things off. So then we were rushing to get food on plates and half of the desert table was already removed so our selection was limited. Our dinner cost us $400 and quite honestly, we could not have been less happy. Even just trying to pay the bill took ov</body>

        <body>The Clubhouse staff was very friendly, as usual, when we arrived. Decorated very nicely for the holidays. We were seated in a nice quite area of the restaurant. We had the New Years Eve special, FANTASTIC!!! Our service from Carlos was absolutely top shelf!! Next time we go, we&apos;ll surely ask for him. We&apos;ll definitely try to get there a little more often.  Thanks Clubhouse!!!!</body>

        <body>This was my first time at the Clubhouse.  It was very nice.  I think the pricing was a little high for being a &quot;Mall&quot; restaurant.  The service was great and the food was NOT the quality of a &quot;Mall&quot; restaurant, it was much better.  Great selection from sandwiches to nice fish selections.</body>

        <body>Short staffed, no water after asking waiter 2x...minor issues for our visit, but slightly disappointing. We waited 15 minutes before anyone attended to our table in which we had to ask bus service to get us wait staff. We are frequent customers, just a little surprised of the under staffed 6pm dining time. Food was excellent, decor was gorgeous! Restroom a but under attended, but clean. Waiter did not take my MVP card, so I did not get credit for our visit.</body>

        <body>Dined here on Valentines Day. Our reservation was for 7:00 pm, we were seated right on time. There were two couples in our group and we both had the Valentines Day package which included shrimp stuffed with crab meat and a filet. The shrimp could have been a bit larger both otherwise the food was very good. On such a busy night the service was excellent. The restaurant is elegant and is ideal for a romantic evening or a night out with a group. Will definitely return.</body>

        <body>Enjoy spectacular views of the new Carquinez Bridge and serene San Pablo Bay while dining on the lushly planted patio with heated and cooled cabanas and twinkling lights. Unique weekend brunch with specialty cocktails. Specialties include 100% USDA Certified Prime, Prime Rib and whole Dungeness crab. Unique dining rooms for an intimate dinner or a large group. &quot;We may have a funny name but we&apos;re dead serious about our food!!&quot;</body>

        <body>Very noisy, no parking, had to wait 20 minutes past or reservation time.  Once we were seated, the meal seemed rushed since there were 50 people waiting for our table.  Maybe they should not take soo may reservation....</body>

        <body>With so few places open on Christmas we were not sure what to expect. We were very pleased with our experience, and so, apparently, were a lot of other folks!  The place was packed, with cars parked in the neighborhoods, on the streets, etc.  fortunately we had made reservations and did not have to wait. The food was good. Service was fine, considering how busy the place was.  OUr window side table provided a great view, and we did not feel rushed to turn over the table for another party.  We will go back and try other items on the menu - the platter of mussels looked inviting!  And the chowder is reportedly very good. All of our crab based dishes were very good for this meal.</body>

        <body>The only edible thing here is the crab. Came with a reservation on a Monday at 5pm and was given a pager and waited 50 minutes to be seated. We were a party of six and ordered a salad and the crab, of course. I noticed that the server was a little upset and was not very talkative about the menu, so I asked him if he thought that the salad was going to be sufficient for the 6 of us, expecting to hear that it will be a salad for six, but he said that we should order another one which we did to find out that those were individual salads, so we order another and shared it. Not very helpful server. The tip matched the service received as it should be.</body>

        <body>This was my second lunch visit.   On my first visit the food was excellent and service was great. This time, it was a holiday weekend and the experience suffered.  The first table they took us to had some construction debris on the booth.  The second table wasn&apos;t cleaned thoroughly.  Our drinks had bugs in them ( we chalked it up to the fresh mint).  My garlic noodles with crab was very good, but the portion was miniscule. My friend&apos;s crab Ceasars salad was also small and drenched in dressing.   Fortunately,  the view still is superb,  and the ambiance makes up a lot.  However, next time I may try the Nantucket.</body>

        <body>The day we were there for lunch (3 days before Christmas) the service was exceedingly slow.  The young waitress tried her best but it was clear she had FAR TOO MANY tables to be able to keep on top of things.   Our food (soup, crab louie, crab sandwich) was tasty but it took 45 minutes to get it to us after ordering.  Other patrons in our area also were complaining about the length of time....one group had waited for 1 hour before their food finally arrived at the table. We will try Dead Fish once again but if the service is again this slow we will not be back nor recommend it to anyone.</body>

        <body>The food was terrible it seems that since the restaurant expanded its dining room the quality of the food and service has been sacrificed. $96.00 for two people was ridiculous and the garlic clam appetizer was extremely disappointing for $30 definitely not worth the prices they are charging. The table behind us also complained about their meal as well.   I will not be returning anytime soon.</body>

        <body>Door left open at night for all the mosquito bites. Cool outside with the air conditioning on full blast. Muscles came out cold. Forgot waters. Drink runner didn&apos;t know if the drink he was delivering was alcoholic or not and never returned when I asked him. Way way overpriced! Unhappy to the max! Great view though.</body>

        <body>If you are a Seafood lover - this is a good place for lunch or dinner.   Service was a little slow.  We had to get  the waiter attention after veing seated for 15 minutes and the restaurant was not a bit busy.  Our reservation was at 5:00 so hardly anyone was there at that time.  However, this is the only restaurant  I would recommend in Pinole/Crocket area.</body>

        <body>They have a great brunch and they never rush you. The view is fantastic. Would love to come back when the weather is nicer and take advantage of their ourdoor seating areas.</body>

        <body>I made reservations at the Dead Fish because we needed a 4:00 seating.  We frequent the DF mostly because it&apos;&apos;s the only decent restaurant in the area, open all day and the food is consistent.  I&apos;d likely consider other options if available primarily because the food is just &quot;ok&quot;, the drink selection is limited - little fresh fruit, few types of vodkas, bourbons, or other libations and the wine list is horrible.    There&apos;s no corkage fee, so you can bring your own wine.  It&apos;s usually quite busy at the Fish, but my guess it s because it&apos;s the only game in town.</body>

        <body>went here last Friday to celebrate my friend&apos;s birthday. Getting in was easy, made reservation thruOpen Table, we were seated right away. The wait service staffs were great. We had the calamari for appetizer it was so tasty. Also we had the crab combination dish, so delicious. We left filled and happy, making plans for our next dinner reservation with more friends to join us. Definitely a great dining out experience!</body>

        <body>I ordered sea bass at $33. Very small piece of fish. It was good but my asparagus was mostly the end stalks and inedible. My friend ordered rare prime rib at $39.  How do you make rare meat dry? It looked like an old reheated piece. His mashed were cold and his spinach tasted like something out of a can from 1950. So salty that he could not eat. Dinner was $142. with tip. REALLY? I hate leaving a restaurant feeling like I just got ripped off. Third and last time.</body>

        <body>Large portions for main course. Nice view from balcony or bar area. Food was delivered immediately after being cooked and was very hot! Some restaurants will wait and food is presented warm. Downside, we ordered chop chop salad. It was overly/super dressed and was simply dripping with dressing. Inedible! When asked our server if it was normal, he replied, yes that&apos;s how our chef wants it prepared. It would have been helpful if servers would mention the over-dressing to patrons when ordering it. Would not recommend it at all!</body>

        <body>Tried The Dead Fish on friends&apos; recommendations. Had reservations for 5:00. Requested a water view &amp; booth. Please note, they do not go hand in hand. Arrived about 15 minutes early. Greeted by a very cheery &amp; pleasant hostess. Seated literally within seconds of checking in.  Was seated in a booth which was roomy for 5 people, but preferred water view over booth. Asked the girl who seated us if water view was available. We were told no. To say the least I was disappointed by this.  But when the hostess heard about my disappointment, she immediately asked if my husband &amp; I would like to check out seating  on the deck. So we checked it out. Not a hard decision....went with deck seating over inside booth. We were seated in what was almost like a private cabana type table area. Don&apos;t worry about being chilly at night on the deck. This cabana type seating had it&apos;s own heater above. And the views were just beautiful.  After being seated on the deck area, our waiter came and introduced himsel</body>

        <body>We had 5:45 reservations for a birthday.  Parking was so awful, we were happy we arrived 15-minutes early as that is how long it took to find a spot.  We walked in promptly at 5:45 and were sourly greeted by a hostess (black hair).  She gave us a notification device and said it would go off when our table was ready.  She did not apologize for the wait, say, &quot;Thank you&quot;, &quot;Welcome!&quot; nothing.  There were a ton of people and we immediately thought that they must have over-booked.  We have been coming to the Dead Fish since for close to 30 years.    There were 5 of us.  After 32 minutes, I walked up to the sour hostess and asked, &quot;When would our table be ready, we had a reservation for 5:45?&quot;  She said, &quot;It&apos;s always this busy -and waiting as long as you have, really isn&apos;t even a wait!&quot;   Not only did she have very poor hospitality graces, she would have been better off cashiering at Wal Mart or another discount mega-store.  I work in HR, in hospitality in SF and as the head of HR would nev</body>

        <body>As I live in the Napa area, I try and stay in wine country to dine out. I just happened to be in the area and was hungry for dinner. The Dead Fish was just what I was looking for. This is such a cool place. Stunning views of the bridge, consistent service, and great fresh fish on the menu. I had the Mussels &amp; Shrimp skillet to start which was very tasty. Shared the Sea Bass poached dinner for the next course which was excellent. Great flavors. I highly recommend the Dead Fish for dinner or hit the bar after a Giants game.</body>

        <body>Overall it was a lovely dining experience. Even though it was Valentines Day and the restaurant was crowded our server was very attentive, helpful and personable. I wish I could remember her name. The drinks from the bar were well done, the bread served at the table was delicious along with the appetizers and main course. Being a big fan of dessert I wish the dessert menu had a little more to offer than ice cream.</body>

        <body>We had reservations and we were seated immediately. Our food arrived hot.  The service was average. The prices were on the high side. We had three children in our party and we appreciated the variety on the children&apos;s menu.  We brought a cake and the hostess refrigerated it. When the time came for the cake they brought it out lit with the candles that we supplied. They do not charge a corkage fee for wine or champagne. Overall, we had a good experience at The Dead Fish and we would go again.</body>

        <body>We had Crab Fettuccini--was ok but not great-portion size was good.  Caesar salad-very ordinary-wasn&apos;t long crisp romaine leaves but chopped up lettuce with average dressing-not very good-wife had a $40 crab-portion size was good but the meat was dry (maybe overcooked)  Dessert was a too sweet lemon cake.  We had 2 good Martinis to start the meal and finished with 2 decaf coffee. Price was $105 plus tip.  Nice ambiance but overpriced.  We&apos;ve eaten here before and have always felt it was overpriced.  The best part of the meal was the bread they served.  I think that there are other menu items that are better (prime rib maybe) but I&apos;ve rarely left there without feeling they charge too much.</body>

        <body>We go to this restaurant for lunch/brunch about 4 time per year. The view of the river is outstanding. We also go when it&apos;s very hot in Walnut Creek and we want to try to catch a bit of a sea breeze as there are excellent opportunities for outside dinning. We also get the mussel appetizer -  very tasty. Had the calamari steak that was served picante-style with a side of pasta - very good! The place was very busy for lunch on Sunday and the service was able to keep up with it.</body>

        <body>Time and time again, The Dead Fish doesn&apos;t disappoint. Especially if you know exactly what you want (in my case, the Killer Crab) and if you have a lot of palates to please. The reason why I would say this isn&apos;t a foodie place is because the restaurant is part of a restaurant group.  These places tend to stick to their specialties and it works. After countless disasters, attempting to expose certain family members to new and different cuisines, I now know that it is best to pick a place where we can all be happy. The Dead Fish and all their sister restaurants fit the bill.  It&apos;s very nicely situated/located, on the water at the Carquinez Bridge.  Beautiful spot. If you have family coming from SF, off of 4 (Antioch area and beyond) and off of 29 (Napa area) then this is your spot. Be nice to the servers and they will take care of you.</body>

        <body>After 22 years we&apos;ve been to many good restaurants. This year we were had to stay local due to unexpected circumstances. We read about the Dead Fish when it first opened and have been hearing about it from friends for some time now but rarely make it to that part of the Bay. Since we haven&apos;t been and it was a special night we decided to give it a whirl.  It was excellent! Friday at 5 was just the right time, as it began filing in at 5:15.  By 6:30 the place was jumping and by this time we knew why...  The service was first class. Our waiter, Chris wasn&apos;t overwhelming but friendly, professional and checked in with us just enough so that we never felt neglected and always had what we needed. Besides Chris, there were several other staff members that worked quickly to bring us our drinks, food, and frequently clear the table. It felt like we were constantly being attended to.  Our drinks, appetizer, salad etc&apos;s came quickly and then just enough of a pause before the entree to savor and r</body>

        <body>Just came in for a birthday celebration and pretty surprised to find good crowd for a monday night.  From appetizers to the main course, everything was excellent, including the &quot;Surf &amp; Turf&quot; combo dinner!  Will definitely order that combo again when I come back.</body>

        <body>It is located in a small town of Crockett, an old industrial town. Not many people think about going there except the locals. It&apos;s cheerful and pleasant, good service and food, a bit pricey. The seafood menu is so-so.  If the weather is nice, after dining there, can take a stroll across the bridge with great view and relaxation.</body>

        <body>We ordered the Lotsa Crab for our table of 5 adults and 2 orders of Garlic Noodles and 2 orders of Seasonal Vegetables.  The noodles and the vegetables were very bland.  The vegetables were overcooked.   We ended up not finishing either.   Other than that the Fried Calamara and the Crab, Clam Chowder were wonderful.</body>

        <body>Host staff was very friendly. Was seated when all the party arrived. Had a window table with a great view of the bridge.  Our waiter, John, was excellent. Very friendly and attentive without being intrusive. He recommended the correct size of  mussel appetizers for our table. They were delicious.   Entrees were very good. Everyone, especially my daughters boyfriend enjoyed there meal. He love the idea of cracking his first whole crab. It took a while but he polished it off.  Now for the hiccup. My daughter ordered a rare prime rib. When it came, it was at least medium.  She didn&apos;t want to return it but I told her if it&apos;s rare you want, it&apos;s rare it should be. I called John over and explained the situation. He took the dish back without question. He returned to say that the kitchen ran out of rare. My daughter switched her order and it was expedited to our table.   One suggestion. I know you want to use all the food cooked in the kitchen, especially when it&apos;s already prepared but pleas</body>

        <body>This was my second time at The Dead Fish and, as the first time, it was wonderful.  We were given the table I requested, the service was efficient, but not suffocating and the food was fabulous.  Last time I had the half dungeness crab and this time the garlic noodles with crab.  As a crab lover, I was more than pleased with both dishes.  I will definitely return again, though it is a 45 minute drive from my house.</body>

        <body>I have been to The Dead Fish several times. The food has ever disappointed me and this time was no exception- the bruschetta is amazing and I had one of my normal entrees the black linguine clam pasta. The least favorite part to our visit was our seating. We had a reservation for two and we were sat on the very first booth to the left following the check-in area/ waiting area. I know the restaurant gets busy so I know I won&apos;t get a scenic view every time relevant to the most ideal seating but sitting right there was so awkward because people were waiting and gathered right next to our table so you can only imagine how weird I felt eating with stranger standing almost right in front of our table waiting to be seated. The only other complaint I have is that we ordered Moscow Mules at the bar while we waited for our buzzer to go off to be seated. The bartender gave us the drinks in big drinking glasses and the drinks did not resemble a Moscow mule. They were very strong and there wasn&apos;t&apos;</body>

        <body>My wife and I have been dining at The Dead Fish for years. YEARS. We had out first kiss and got engaged in their parking lot and have enjoyed a New Year&apos;s Eve meal with them since 2010.   Last night was not the experience we are accustomed to receiving. According to their bartender, they double booked reservation and one look around it was clear that his statement had merit.   We attempted to check-in with our reservation and were told that they were out of pagers and they would call our name. Not that this would be the end of the world, but there were over 50 people waiting and I wasn&apos;t sure they would find us.   We grabbed a drink at the bar, I attempted to let them know that we would be there so they could actually find us and not have to &quot;call our name&quot;. They didn&apos;t bother to write this tidbit of information down.   Eventually we got a pager and 45 minutes after our reservation was scheduled to start, at table.   Dinner was fine, rushed and our waitress was singular dimensional in</body>

        <body>Excellent service and outstanding food. Our waiter Chris has always been the best since we started coming to the Dead Fish. He is superb, knowledgeable and on top. Love this place. It is a special spot for the prefect dining experience.  Get there early as parking is limited.</body>

        <body>You can always expect a good meal and a good experience.  We have been going to the Dead Fish ever since it opened and it only continues to get better.  No matter if it&apos;s just a night out or a special occasion or drinks and appetizers on a nice day, the Dead Fish always fits the bill and then some.  Great Food, great Staff, great Ambience.</body>

        <body>Although our meal was good the service was &quot;so-so&quot;  We were made to wait 40+ minutes for our reservation and then they wanted to seat us in the bar where we had already been sitting and waiting for a table.   They really need to get their act together with regards to seating guests within a reasonable period of time of the reservation.</body>

        <body>Service was extremely slow. Food was cold and incorrect. Drinks were watered down. When I asked the waitress to correct the food she was rude and didn&apos;t come back with a new bun for twent minutes and all I asked for was a new bun for my fish sandwhich. Will not be referring anyone there again. I have already starting tell people I previously referred, not to return.</body>

        <body>We have eaten at the Dead Fish many times and always enjoy it.  The food is consistently good, the  servers are friendly and generally attentive enough.   If you plan to eat on the patio be prepared for the following.  Once you receive the bill and pay, the outdoor heaters by your table are turned off, if that doesn&apos;t get rid of you, they will remove the water glasses and anything else on the table.  Good luck seeing your waiter or waitress at this stage in the evening.  Given that this has happened the last three times we have eaten at this restaurant, I don&apos;t think it is coincidence.</body>

Loved how the freshly made warm bread just kept coming.  The view is spectacular.  The décor is unique and incredibly fun.  Great place!!</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve found that if you make your reservation any time after 5p on a weekend, you will have much difficulty in finding parking. There are three parking lots for customer parking but they&apos;re always full. Even with reservations, you still have to wait. During this last visit, the restaurant was short -staffed.  Hostesses were less than friendly,  thus showing frustration.  But once the wait to be seated is over, the food is wonderful and servers and related staff are to be commended.</body>

        <body>We have eaten at The Dead  Fish several times and were impressed but not on this visit. May have been overbooked but the Hostess stand seemed overwhelmed. I  believe we were taken to the wrong patio area after making reservations for Inside. We could have waited I guess for another table. The actual problem this time the soup was not hot and when I informed the waiter he said he would inform the kitchen. Not the answer I expected. Then both my wife&apos;s short rib and my calamari steak were very salty. I could barely eat the calamari. Again when I told the waiter about this he said he would inform the kitchen. After a poor dinner we passed on desert. I  don&apos;t think I will visit again on any type of holiday as this ruined my wife&apos;s evening. The prices seem to have gone up but the food was not good this visit. Service was OK but I felt the server was stretched thin. This was disappointing as our other visits were good, even around Valentines Day.</body>

        <body>We love the outdoor cabanas, which offer a bit of privacy and an excellent view. The inside dining area is also beautiful, offering an upscale, yet relaxed atmosphere. The seafood is always fresh, delicious, and perfectly prepared, The crab enchiladas are one of my personal favorites. The service is always excellent. This is our go-to place to meet up with friends. This is a higher-end dining choice...not for shoe-string budgets.</body>

        <body>Although the Dead Fish has been in operation for several years, we just &quot;found&quot; it.  From the moment you walk in it&apos;s a great experience.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  The food is delicious and the price is very reasonable.  Did I say the food was delicious?</body>

        <body>We have had our Christmas dinner at Dead Fish for about eight years and this year, we were really disappointed on all fronts. Although we had a reservation, we had to wait 45 minutes for a table, and didn&apos;t get the window table we had requested in writing. When the half crab came to the table -- it was $20-something -- it was more like a quarter of a crab. I sent it back, and the one they replaced it with wasn&apos;t much better. When the cioppino came, we had to flag down a waiter and ask for serving bowls and a ladle. The dessert we ordered -- torta della nona -- was undercooked and floury.   What was so annoying is that we have ordered pretty much the same meal over the years, and always before it was superb. But this time, Dead Fish really missed the mark, and we got the general feeling that the restaurant didn&apos;t particularly care. The evening just wasn&apos;t as special as it should have been. (And why, oh why, did they take that wonderful wedge salad with the Pt. Reyes blue cheese dressin</body>

        <body>We have been coming to the Dead Fish since our best friends moved into the area.  Now a visit with them is not complete without at least one visit to the Dead Fish Restaurant!   This restaurant we ALL agree on!  I don&apos;t know what&apos;s better the food or the amazing views!   This restaurant has quickly become our go to restaurant when we are anywhere near the area!

        <body>We sat next to a large party of about 20 who sat around to conversate after their dinner and I was not able to hear the conversation that I was having with my husband. Other than that, the service was good and so was the food! A little pricey, but defenitely worth it.</body>

        <body>Made 7:15 reservation To be fair, it was New Year&apos;s Eve. We were seated at 8:15 They claimed that the prior reservations stayed late, but it was obvious that they booked way too many reservations. The food is excellent and the service quite good, prices very fair and no corkage Would definitely go back, but will wait for a &quot; less busy&quot; night.</body>

        <body>We moved to the North Bay almost 2 years ago and have always wanted to try the &quot;food place by the bridge&quot;.  Most of the time it was just a fleeting thought every time we crossed the Carquinez but when I found out it was owned by the same people as The Stinking Rose I knew I had to try.  The Stinking Rose is one of my favorite places to eat in all of San Francisco so I figured with that fact and plus all the reasons on Yelp I couldn&apos;t possibly go wrong.   Well, I&apos;ve been wrong before and I was wrong that Saturday night.  Although, the food was good it wasn&apos;t great.  Portions were sized down and overpriced.  The environment was eclectic but it bordered overbearing.  The highlight easily was the wait staff.  Great great GREAT staff they have over there.  I would definitely recommend but not for the food. It would be more for the experience.   Just my opinion.</body>

        <body>The Dead Fish overcooks most items but still it is a standby in the area for the scenic view of the bay and the crab. I probably go there once a week just to enjoy the ambiance.</body>

        <body>As always, the Dead Fish serves a variety of seafood. I had the fish and chips because they include the best french fries I have ever tasted. They are lightly spiced and delicious. The crab cake appetizer was very tastey, but the peppers served with it were extremely hot. That was a surprise.</body>

        <body>This used to be an amazing restaurant with a gorgeous view. We used to dine there often, but after several bad experiences we just stopped going. We decided to try it again, and it has only continued to drop in service and food quality. They need TRAINED staff. The hostess was rude and very pleased with her power--she will seat you where she wants, regardless of your requests and willingness to wait. There are no words to explain the horrific service. The food was average, at best. The Dead Fish needs management--management that understands restaurant service and cares about quality.</body>

        <body>They need to better coordinate multiple servers bringing food. No one knows what you have ordered and it&apos;s total confusion.  If two people at same table order shrimp cocktail(easy to prepare) then they  should receive them less than 15 minutes apart. Tiramisu is not served frozen, please.</body>

        <body>Had reservations for Easter dinner, however they weren&apos;t crowded and we were seated without accessing the reservations.  My entree was Prime Rib, which I ordered medium well...it was tender/delicious.  How ER the sides were cold (mashed potatoes and cream spinach.).  They took the cold side dishes, and brought new sides.   The second set of sides was cold too!  My family had Lots of a Crabs&apos; to share....the revived. Almostly entirely small legs as the bodies had been removed.   The had &apos;garlic noodles&apos; however the pasta was wide-noodles (like fettuccine) and not well seasoned like Crustaceans!  The clam chowder was Kodak.</body>

        <body>We come here every few months and this last time was are last.  The clams they served us had a foul smell and tasted nasty we sent those back and got a second batch and still the same. The garlic noodles were dry only thing that was good was the crab. Clam chowder was ok and it came very late. Service was just horrible you would think the manager would ask if you would like something different or have dessert on them but nope. At least the waiter was honest by tell us we weren&apos;t the only ones they had a few people send their clams back.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve lived in the area for 25 years and always heard great things about the Dead Fish but had never dined there. This Christmas i recieved a gift card from my kids and took my wife and foodie daughter for dinner.  It was an extremely busy Saturday night but we were seated right on time for our reservation and had a wonderful view of the bay and Carquinez bridge. I think we waited longer to order than to recieve our food. I had prime rib and crab with amazingly good garlic mashed potatos and creamed spinach. I felt the crab was over cooked and had been sitting for awhile, but the prime rib was spot on!  My daughter enjoyed her prime rib and shrimp. My wife got the crab fettucini and while it seemed like a small portion, she had no room to finish it even though it was very delicious and would be my choice next time.  I would recommend this restraunt for a nice night out. Maybe get there before sunset to enjoy the best views!</body>

        <body>I&apos;m so glad that a friend recommended The Dead Fish!  In Crockett (NE Bay) but worth a short drive across the Carquinez Bridge.  Fun ambience in a casual atmosphere with the best fresh fish.  With some meat items on their menu, you can even include your non-fish-eating friends.  My non-fish-eating-friend had clams, so that says it all!  Sit outside on the deck, or in a cabana -- the heat lamps will keep you warm, if the cocktails don&apos;t.</body>

        <body>We had reservations for two at 5 o&apos;clock with a request for water view.  Because parking was difficult to find we arrived at the reservation desk at 5:06.  A table was not available for us so we sat at the bar to enjoy the view and have a cocktail.  The tonic was flat but by the time we caught the bartenders attention our drinks were half gone so we declined his offer to give us a fresh drink.  The two of us were finally seated at 5:55 PM in a large booth that could accommodate eight in a noisy room. The waitstaff was not friendly but efficient, the food was okay except the calamari was very salty.  We were extremely disappointed in our first experience at The Dead Fish.</body>

        <body>Loved the food as always.  Very surprised by the service this time around.  Server was not attentive whatsoever.  Experienced extreme wait times to put in order, as well as for final bill.  Not what i&apos;m used to for The Dead Fish.</body>

        <body>I have come here several times. The food is okay, not that outstanding.  My son ordered pasta and he finished it quickly. My friend ordered the &quot;Dead Burger&quot;. It came refrigerated-like cold. They made the new warmer one for her.  My husband and I used to order fish, crab, Short Rib and seafood hot plate. We ordered Prime Rib this time. The steak is tender. But we had steak at many other steak restaurants, so their prime rib just taste up to standard which makes it look a little pricy.  The atmosphere is good if you can sit outdoor for brunch or lunch. Dinner is perfect too because they don&apos;t have corkage fee and this is the most I like about this restaurant.</body>

        <body>This is one of my favorite spots for any occasion. David the bartender is a true cocktail artist. The mussels appetizer is a MUST HAVE. My favorite entre is the salmon prepared with Thai curry and, yes, more mussels. The wine list isn&apos;t extensive but nice with a great option for a half bottle in a carafe. I love the candelabra they bring to the table for birthdays- very classy. Plus the setting &amp; view are exceptional. Highly recommended for any occasion.</body>

        <body>This was my first time at Dead Fish.  it will not be the last.  While it was crowded and noisy......5 pm on Sunday, it was worth it.  I ordered angel hair crab lasagna.  Outstanding  dish.  My busbAnd ordered the salmon and loved it.  My sister ordered the crab enchilada .  Also great.  The menu focused on a lot of crab entrees, I suspect because of the season.  Our server was excellent.  I also need to mention the fabulous bread that kept coming to our table.  Everything was great.  Only thing......parking was terrible.  I had to drive around for ten minutes waiting for someone to leave.  All said....I am still thinking about the food three days later!  It was that good.</body>

        <body>Enjoyed a lunch with family at The Dead Fish last Friday.  The crab sandwich was very good, and my table mates enjoyed their selections with one exception:  a beet salad that was served in a very awkward bowl and was very short on the goat cheese.   Service was terrific, and we were seated right at our reservation time.  A good time was had by all.</body>

        <body>I couldn&apos;t believe I had to ask for a glass of water 4 times before I eventually received it.  I asked our waiter 3 times and another individual who brought one of my cocktails 1 time.  The waiter eventually brought my water after I called him over and asked him what it takes to get a glass of water and that this was my 4th request.  My bill came to $200.24 and left him with a 10% tip, I usually leave 20%.  On the ride home, I was thinking I left him too much of a tip.  I will still continue to be a patron, we love the food and the view.</body>

        <body>Good view of the water &amp; the  Carquinez bridge. The food was ok. We had the garlic crab which is rather bland. The  ambiance was good . It reminds me of those quaint rustic old world restaurant. Service was good though. With open table, we do&apos;nt need to wait that long.</body>

        <body>The parking situation is the worst thing about the Dead Fish.  The food was good and good size portions. They had a good selection of wines by the glass with very generous pours.   I had the bone in filet mignon and it was delicious.  My daughters had the short ribs and the Bolognese and both were very good. My husband had the prime rib and was disappointed.  My mom had the crab legs and shrimp and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My dad had the crab lasagne and found the portion to be small. If you like cream spinich, you won&apos;t like this, no cream, just very salty sauted spinich</body>

        <body>My husband and I have been going to the dead fish for years. Always for dinner, this time we went for lunch with our three children.  We sat on the patio and had a very memorable time.  Views were amazing, clear sunny day.  The kids had the copper pan pancakes and loved them.  Very consistent and always a great meal!</body>

        <body>I have been going to this restaurant for years now on our to or from the bay area.  It  has been a special treat for my family and something we look forward to.  I made reservations, well in advance, for a party of six for 4/5/2015; at 1:00.  We arrived 10 minutes early.  After waiting for about 20 minutes we were directed to an outside table.  Usually, I would be fine with this, however it was a cold, rainy, stormy day.  I asked to be seating inside and was told that it would be another 30 minutes wait, even though I had a 1:00 reservation.  Did not have time to wait another 30 minutes, as we needed time to get over the summit in the storm.  We took the outside table.  Very disappointing and cold.  We were one of only three tables/customers seated outside.  The food was delicious as always and the wait service was very good as well.  Not sure why they accept and confirm reservations without having room inside or at least letting me know at time of confirmation that we would be seated</body>

        <body>I was very disappointed in two of the meals that my party of four ordered. FIrst, the prime rib at $35.00 was extremely disappointing as all of us tried it and could tell they had under cooked the meat and then put it in the microwave to zap it and make it medium well vs. medium. It really lacked flavor as well. Second, the single crab enchilada for $15.00. The single enchilada was no more than 9 inches long and did not have a side of rice and beans or anything with it. WHAT A RIP, only a tiny enchilada. I have had a better Prime Rib at Black Angus and it&apos;s $50.00 for two of us to get prime rib. As far as the enchilada, I would have enjoyed at least a side of rice to go with it or small salad would do.   Lastly, I ordered water with my meal and getting my glass refilled was like pulling teeth. No servers were ever around to even ask for refill.  The Dead Fish has nothing more than great views. Won&apos;t be rushing back anytime soon.</body>

        <body>The 2nd time dined at this restaurant.  Not sure because it was a late dinner but the service was not as good as the first time we went.  I still did not get the window seat per my request.   Our server was not attentive enough, our bowl was over filled with shells when we were still eating from the skillet roasted shellfish combo, no one cared to empty for us. My husband said the type fish he had on the fish and chips was not a suitable kind of fish for this dish, the texture was flakey.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to the Dead Fish at least 50 times. It&apos;s our company lunchroom and we meet friends there occasionally. The service is always good and friendly. They pour a great beer, their wine list is limited but decent, and their other drinks are good. The fish is always fresh and it&apos;s preparation is fine, if a bit gloppy in the sauce department at times. The food tastes good, even when it&apos;s gloppy, and the place is comfortable. If you&apos;re hanging out for a business lunch or a Friday/Saturday with friends, it&apos;s a great place to hang. Outside it&apos;s really nice. It&apos;s not a place to go for cuisine, but they don&apos;t make pretenses about being that kind of place.  That said, this is a nitpick, but a big one: do not order the house salad. They used to have the best house salad anywhere and it was a fair price. Now it sucks. A few pieces of lettuce on a sad little plate for $8.95. I sent it back; I couldn&apos;t believe they were trying to get away with that. I&apos;ve talked to the waiters/esses a few times</body>

        <body>This is NOT the place to go, if you want a quiet meal w/ quiet romantic conversation.  Not only were we three seated in a booth which had a music speaker overhead, but the ambient noise was outrageous!  My boyfriend and I had to raise our voices in order to hear each other, my father (who wears hearing aids) could not hear us at all.  Even when I leaned over and spoke directly in his ear, the ambient noise was such that I had to repeat myself.  During the week, however, both the lounge and dining room are much quieter.</body>

        <body>Busy Friday night. Our 6:15 reservation didn&apos;t get us a table for another 30min. We were travelling through area so this caused a delay. Crab chowder is great but cold. Good portion sizes and good menu.</body>

        <body>As nice as the service was, the food was just all right.  I did not order seafood and was limited in what I could find on the menu for me to eat.   The mashed potatoes tasted old, and they were served warm, not hot --- I could not even finish it, it just was not palatable.   I had mentioned at the beginning that it was my friend&apos;s birthday, and I was hoping maybe they would put a candle in her dessert or something to help celebrate her birthday, but this did not happen.  Also, as we were seated outside, we noticed quickly at the end of the meal that someone was smoking pot outside the restaurant --- I complained about it and was told nothing is usually done to enforce that kind of activity.</body>

        <body>I have been dining regularly at The Dead Fish for the last couple of years and have always been eager to go back. I love the atmosphere and the food has always been consistently very good. However, my last two visits were somewhat disappointing.  The iron-skillet roasted mussels, which I order almost every time I dine there, were very dirty and had not been debearded. After I found a mouthful of mud and my guest a good sized rock, we sent them back and they were replaced, but not particularly graciously.  We received the new order, which were cleaner, but still not debearded, and finished our meal, saying that we were disappointed, but one not-so-great meal after all the great ones we&apos;d enjoyed there was bound to happen once in a while. We returned a week later, this time with a large family group, and had another discouraging experience. Few people out of our party of 10 thought their meal was great and the rest of us put it into the &quot;okay&quot; category, which is not something we are use</body>

        <body>We chose to celebrate VDay early and beat the Feb 14th crowd. Good thing we made a reservation, the restaurant was loud and crowded. Eventhough we made a reservation we were sat at a really high table in the bar area. Not my idea of quiet and romantic. Food was ok but the service was great. We hadn&apos;t been in while...didn&apos;t realize how popular it had become especially on a weeknight. I was expecting to dine in the dining room since we had reservations. The wonderful view was the most enjoyable part of the evening.</body>

        <body>We met one person from Napa and one from SF and we came from Sonoma. It was a heavy traffic day and the hostesses were wonderfully accommodating. They understood the problem and worked with us. When everyone finally arrived, they gave us a large booth to celebrate a birthday. The food was good as usual, but this time the service was slow and inattentive. We had to ask for water twice and sat with dirty dishes way too long. Even tho I had reserved stating it was a birthday, they didn&apos;t produce the birthday candelabra for my friend. I was disappointed in the service in the dining room, but applaud the hostesses.</body>

        <body>I do not recommend anyone to dine at this establishment on a holiday such as valentines day. Everyone I have spoke to about this place strongly recommended it. My food was under cooked the crab enchiladas had shells inside of it. The waitress took a hour to bring me a glass of water. I did not enjoy myself one bit.</body>

        <body>Phenomenal food, great atmosphere, but service is very lacking.  In the past, the waiters were very attentative,  you never had to ask for bread and butter.  Unfortunately, the service is NOT what it used to be.  There seemed to be several servers and bus boys who just passed you by without checking to see if you had everything you needed.  When we asked several times for water and bread, we waited until almost the time when our meal was served.  Lunch plates are miniscule compared to prior visits in the last few years.  We  know Chris very well.  He is an  excellent, outstanding  waiter, but unfortunately he was off on Sunday.   We felt the waiter deserved very little tip, but we&apos;re succumbed to giving him more than we desired.</body>

        <body>Different than other times, quality of  food was not as good as before.  Too many people at the place and kitchen was over busy.  I recommend this place but try to go on regular nights.  Parking is limited and I had to park in a hill on the street this time. My prime rib was average when it usually is great.  I order medium rare and came medium with a lot of fat.  The size was also wrong.  My wife order surf and turf and they brought the meat practically swimming in the crab water.  The mussels were not as good quality as usually.   The only good thing was the service we had from our server. Always checking and getting things fast and taking care of us.</body>

        <body>UNFORTUNATELY, I was not impressed especially how other people have raved about the food, ambiance and considered a &quot;special occasion&quot; place. Food was mediocre - quantity is good but quality seemed ok, nothing to rave about.  Prime Rib was nothing special with your typical sides - I wanted to try the Roasted Crab here but unfortunately un-impressed but otherwise, good.  Just not impressed - (I always compare it to Thanh Long&apos;s and if you know Thanh Long, then you know GOOD &quot;@SS&quot; ROASTED CRAB - no comparison at all - have yet to find something comparable) Lamb was overcooked and tough (we ordered it medium rare).  Their Saturday Brunch menu wasn&apos;t too bad at all actually.   Service on the other hand could use a little &quot;bump&quot; if I&apos;m going to pay &quot;higher&quot; priced meals so my expectations here were high - even though our server was polite and courteous, he was nothing special and seemed not too excited to take our dinner orders.  No acknowledgement if we ever dined there before or asked us</body>

        <body>The dining experience was very good. Although it was very busy, the servers did a great job of keeping you informed about how long your food order was going to be.  Due to the large number of people being seated at any given time, be sure to have patience and your experience will be great. When the food arrived, it was hot and cooked to perfection. We had the surf and turf, calimari, whole crab, cocktails and crab chowder. The one thing I would suggest is; the seating chart&apos;s for couples or groups could be arranged better. The entire time my wife and I ate, there were five empty chairs at our table. I am sure there were couples in line that could have filled that space. You also had couples in booths that were meant for four to five people. That also could cut down in the wait time.</body>

        <body>Reservation made weeks prior. Was seated 40 minutes after reservation time. Requested specific seating. Specific seating was available at reserved time but given to another guest. Seating I was given was worst table in restaurant. food was good and writer was good but ambiance terrible, noises, draft from constantly opening service door, AC vent directly over table, table in confined space. Very disappointed after having had many good experiences at restaurant</body>

        <body>We came here on a recommendation from a friend. It was a very foggy drive on Saturday night but we made it. I had 5pm reservations.  When we arrived the place was packed, people standing everywhere waiting to be seated. I checked in and received a buzzer for when the table was ready. We waited about 5 minutes and then were seated.  This place has a great view but we couldn&apos;t see anything with the fog.  I ordered the sea bass and hubby got the prime rib-we also shared some cheese bread. My fish was really good and my husbands rib was good too-the second time-He ordered med and got rare-He is not one to complain so he started to eat it. A food runner came out half way through the meal and changed it out for a med one. That was nice of them. Service was good, our server was Chauna and she was on the ball!! We will come again but not on a Saturday-to many people.</body>

        <body>although the food was incredibly tasteful, It arrived lukewarm. perhaps due to demand on Xmas day. We didn&apos;t send it back for that very reason. It wasn&apos;t inedible. ultimately, we Took most of it home to eat later. Nevertheless we had an amazing time.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to this restaurant several times and I know it gets busy. This is why I made a reservation on Open Table for 6pm. We checked in a few minutes late (parking was horrendous), and were told to wait. 30 mins passed, then 40. At one point, a hostess loudly said my last name, so 3 of us turned around. She handed me another pager, but we already had one. When we asked the hostess why we got two, she said it was because she called the name &quot;Delgado&quot; (NOT my name) and that we raised our hands. Three of us heard her say Delgado, and not my name? (very different, by the way). So, she comes up to me and says &quot;so, you&apos;re NOT Delgado??&quot;, with attitude. I then say &quot;No, I never...&quot; and she walks away as I&apos;m speaking. Her mistake, not mine. We got seated at 7:15pm (with a 6pm reservation) in an uncomfortable corner, with two small tables pushed together (9 of us total). We didn&apos;t complain because we were so hungry at that point. Our server, Alex, was fantastic and did everything he could to </body>

        <body>We had Christmas lunch/brunch at the Dead Fish. It was our first time at the restauant and in Crockett. The 1/2 order of crab was delicious (their specialty) and the lamb with potatoes, creamed spinach and gravey was amazing - tender, flavorful and well presented. The meal was great and our server friendly, present but not hovering. We enjoyed looking out the window at the Carquinez Bridge and Straits. The Dead Fish is hidden in plain site - a real gem.</body>

        <body>$17 for a hamburger and fries is way to high.  Understand the prices on the seafood but do they do something extremely differnt to make it worth that kind of $$$$.  Was good.</body>

        <body>Our server took 15 minutes to even greet us for drinks.  He finally came over and we ordered when the drinks came out my husband and I noticed lipstick on my glass. When the waiter finally came back he tried to make light of the situation by asking if it was my husband&apos;s lipstick. We ordered appetizers (calamari and oysters) calamari was average but cold, oysters were not good. Ordered our food we both got the surf and turf. Husband had the crab and filet and I ordered crab and prime rib. The prime rib was the only thing that was good. The crab was very greasy and the filet was flavorless.  In reality we could go somewhere else for great/superb prime rib!  We finished up left crab and meat on plate....and my husband wanted to try the tiramisu well it took 30 minutes to get and was awful.  Took 2-3 bites and we were done. Back to the server, he was not busy by any means and he wasn&apos;t the one even running his drinks or plates....he just was slow and wasnt attentive.</body>

        <body>We have been here before and decided to bring 2 other couples on Valentine&apos;s day for lunch. I have been to other restaurants that we liked, then we take friends it is disappointing. This was not the case with Dead Fish and we even went on a holiday which I have found at other restaurants, is not always a good idea. Everything was very good and we had a very nice lunch.</body>

        <body>Ordered the 2-3lb garlic crab. Excellent but hard to eat, like any crab. Also got the garlic noodles. Excellent. Hubby ordered the 18 oz prime rib. At 7:00 they only had medium rare. He likes it to still moo. He will say it wasn&apos;t 18 oz. The kids got the kids garlic/cheese/butter noodle. My son vomited on the way home from the restaurant then again when we got home an hour later. The noise level was out of control. It wasn&apos;t a very pleasant experience but the crab is worth getting again but it was $60 so not so sure.</body>

        <body>They have great bread.  Their best dishes are Shrimp Cioppino , the Fisherman&apos;s Stew, and the Roasted Shellfish platters.  Prime Rib and Short Rib dishes are waaay too salty for my tastes.  Fresh fish and pasta dishes are uninspiring.     Most irritating thing about the Dead Fish?  We usually get reservations for weekend nights (Fri-Sun) 5:30 or 6 pm.   We&apos;ve dined here for years.  THEY ARE NEVER ON TIME.   The best we&apos;ve had is a 10 minute wait for our &quot;reserved&quot; table.  We&apos;ve had to wait as long as 20-30 minutes.  We as customers always arrive oh time.  Why can&apos;t the restaurant reciprocate and have our table on time?  Yes, it&apos;s not always their fault, but  you&apos;d think after all these years in business, they&apos;d have this part of the operations down pat...  Our party of four was seated at one of their SMALL round tables.  We ordered four entrees, a tureen of stew, an appetizer, and a salad.  Add the drinks and the &quot;discard bowl&quot; for the shells and you can imagine what little space we h</body>

        <body>We arrived early, were seated immediately. Our drinks came quickly and were superb. The crab crostini melted with each bite, which was hard to do because they topped each with a heaping mound of delicious fresh crab. The crab chowder was also full of crab and home style comforting, creamy and very yummy. My husbands prime rib was cooked to perfection. The creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes  along side it were full of flavor and cooked just right! My sea bass in the spicy tomato sauce w/olives was A-MAZING. I was overly pleased, the fish was cooked to perfection and the sauce complimented each tender bite just right. There was no room for desert, but next time I will have to make some. I am sure with a dinner that fabulous desert must also be top notch! This place is a must try. I can&apos;t wait to come back with more family and friends.</body>

        <body>Ordered the Filet Mignon and half crab. The crab was super the filet not so much, I order filet and cook it frequently but this I have to say was different. SUPER fatty and not tender as it should be. I have never had a filet like that ever. Was very disappointed. But as I said the crab was super, shouldve ordered the whole crab. Husband had the crab enchiladas and he was satisfied.  Service was fast and friendly. Would definately go back..... for crab only.</body>

        <body>4 of us had dinner and three rated their food highly.  I had been thinking about dungeness crab since the moment I made the reservation.  I was disappointed.  Ordered half a cracked crab.  It was cooked in a spicy brine.  And while the brine  was tasty, it totally overpowered the sweet, delicate taste of the crab.     Otherwise the setting was lovely, we had a great visit with our friends, salad was good..lamb was reported to be excellent, fish cooked with mild Thai sauce was great and crab pasta was good.</body>

Did not try the brunch, but will go back to try that--the menu and prices look more in line with something that should be a better deal.</body>

        <body>The Dead fish might be a fun place to eat. But the night we went was extremely loud. We were seated next to a huge party that was very loud. Was a very un fun dinner, we could not even hear ourselves talk. Had I looked into this restaurant a little better I would have asked for a certain location. Very busy night service was not very good, do not feel manager accounted for the large amount of people was under staffed .Our  waitress may have been nice but she did not check on us and our food all came out at different times and was not that great. I had a salad that was hot. Where I come from salad&apos;s are served chilled. Not sure I will go back.</body>

        <body>Great place for crab, but their fish selections are not so good.  Fish and chips made with Basa, an questionable fish to say the least (google it).  It&apos;s also the only reasonably priced fish selection in their &apos;three types of fish, five ways to make it&apos; deal.  The waitress described it as &apos;a river fish, in the catfish family&apos;.  Uck. No pan fried petrale sole, very disappointing.   Great bread though! If the &apos;Dead Fish&apos; is Basa, better pass on that.</body>

        <body>Don&apos;t know if they were short staffed on the day after the New Year, but the service was very slow and unresponsive. Had to ask for water 3 times before it arrived and service of appetizers, salads and entrees was really slow and inattentive.  Check in was odd as well, did not feel really welcoming.   Food was Great and the ambiance was fantastic. Still tipped 15% because got the feeling that our waiter was overwhelmed/overloaded. We had dined here a couple months previous and the service was great and it was an all around great experience. That&apos;s why we came back with our son and his girlfriend...This time, not so much.  On the fence if we are going to make the trip again.</body>

        <body>The Prado is one of the best restaurants in San Diego.  The location, in Balboa Park is priceless and beautiful.  The food is out of this word and the service is also.  This is a “must see” for anyone visiting San Diego!</body>

        <body>My review is only regarding the service.  I am one of few people who have a severe intolerance  to onion.  I have been hospitalized for it.  When I told this to the waiter, the response was &quot;Well we put shallots in everything and no one has ever died.&quot;  I explained  that I really can&apos;t have it, I am on vacation, here only for a couple days and would be sick the entire time.  I am open to whatever they can make work, just plain grilled steak for example is fine.  That&apos;s what I got.  They literally just plopped a plain piece of steak on a plate and that was it.  Nothing else.  Never offered anything in place of the sides that typically come with it and charged the full price.  I have NEVER been treated so rude over something I have no control over.  It was shocking.  This guy has not been trained on food allergies or even basic respect.  Just a warning to other food allergy sufferers.</body>

        <body>Pre-theater dinner with a friend.   Great server, very attentive without hovering.  Food was great. I had the chicken with gnochi and my friend had the salmon.  I always get the beet salad with goat cheese, love it!  Will be back!</body>

        <body>We visited the Prado after our experience climbing the Balboa Park Tower at the Museum of Man to enjoy the spectacular views.  Had a great lunch on the patio. Appreciated being able to make a reservation online. Nice breeze even though it was pretty warm.  Virgin Mojito is a perfect refresher not to be missed! It was a busy Friday but we enjoyed the hummus and flatbreads while we waited for our lunches to be served.  Mom had a fish BLT-something new to her. She loved it and it was her birthday so we enjoyed what we assumed was a lovely, and dense flan with shortbread cookies as her birthday treat... on the house!  The Prado is always a great choice. Even during the Earth Day Fair which is always packed with over 60,000 participants- yet we always find a table and get away from the crowd at the Prado Restuarant.</body>

        <body>Normally, we prefer to dine al fresco. However, this evening the outdoor patio was out of operation due to the rain.  Nevertheless, all turned out well because it afforded us an opportunity to appreciate the charming interior.    It is difficult to point out any highlights because all went well.   However, on this evening, the service was very good.  The dining made our visit to the Old Globe Theater even that much better. Looking forward to the next visit.</body>

        <body>Prix fixe dinner for Christmas was very lackluster. The service was great and all the dishes were very pretty, but the steak was tasteless and all the entrees were lukewarm at best. An OK experience, but definitely less than expected.</body>

        <body>Any restaurant in a place as lovely would be nice even If the food were average. Not only is the restaurant and setting spectacular but the food just tops it all off. It&apos;s all done so smoothly and effortlessly its like you died and went to heaven. It&apos;s not cheap but its well worth it. The wine list is limited but well chosen. I&apos;ll be back....</body>

        <body>Tuesday Date Night  Menu is a great value for two. The entree selection is plenty without the need to order an appetizer if you want to add a desert.</body>

        <body>My husband and I took advantage of the &quot;Date Night&quot; special on Tuesday nights and had a truly memorable meal, including salmon and paella.  I would say that the paella was the bewst I have ever tasted.  The service was impeccable.  Our two servers were absolutely charming and knowledgeable.  I highly recommend The Prado!</body>

        <body>We have eaten at Prado many times over the years when we visit San Diego.  The food generally has been very good in the past so we make an effort to book a table.  I&apos;m not sure we will make the effort in the future. We had dinner and a lunch there during our recent visit. Although the service was great as usual the food was not as well prepared as it has been in the past.</body>

        <body>The bill was a little confusing with a line for &quot;round up&quot; above the tip line. But after some crossing out, we got it right.  I was pleased that they took us on time for our reservation since the restaurant was mobbed with lots of people waiting.</body>

        <body>We had a wonderful dinner last Friday night.  It wasn&apos;t our first time there, and the food has always been good, but , I think the food was even better.  I had the salmon and my husband had the filet and shrimp--both were outstanding!</body>

        <body>The Prado has always been at the top of the list as far as our favorite special occasion places in San Diego.  Maybe because it was 12/23 and bustling due to the holidays,  but it was extremely noisy,  service was unbelievably slow and overall it was a bummer of an experience relative to the hopes we had for a romantic. quiet pre-holiday celebration for just the 2 of us.   We won&apos;t give up,  but will know to be more specific in our reservation for next time.</body>

        <body>We took advantage of restaurant week lunch to take a visitor to one of our faves.  We LOVE the Prado and have eaten lunch and dinner there many times over the years.  They were crazy busy as would be expected but we still had decent service.    On this day: Humus and flatbreads--excellent &amp; happy to see them on arrive in Restaurant Week Chopped salad--excellent Turkey bolognese--good Grilled cheese sandwich--had to take the bread apart to see if there was any cheese in there and the Serano ham gave it an odd flavor; the only grilled cheese worth the name must be gooey with cheese coming out the edges.  This one missed by a mile! Paella (not on restaurant week menu)--very good  Keep it up Prado, but please fix that grilled cheese:)</body>

        <body>Wonderful food and great service!  Love the outdoor setting in Balboa Park, lovely to stroll the Prado and see the holiday lights on the Tuesday before Christmas.  The shrimp and filet was outstanding as was the yummy Creamsicle Creme Brulee!!  One of my favorite places to take visitors from out of town.</body>

        <body>Service was outstanding, and our outdoor seating was delightful (that&apos;s sunny San Diego for you), with a lovely view. Our waitress was helpful, patient, and flexible. If not for difficulty finding parking in Balboa Park, I would have given our overall experience 5 stars all-round. Nevertheless, a great experience.</body>

        <body>Every time we go to Balboa Park to visit one of the museums, one of the highlights of the day is to have lunch at The Prado.  We are never disappointed.  The staff, from reception through to the person serving the water are all welcoming, cheery and helpful.  Our waitress Kate, although very busy, was attentive and pleasant.   The menu provides a good variety of choices, from smaller dishes to large plates, all with careful presentation and complementary flavours.  I had one of the appetizers - a Trio of Skewers - beef, chicken and shrimp each with a different sauce or marinade, served with an Asian slaw.  Delicious.  My husband had a spinach salad entree size with shrimp, with a request to hold the walnuts, which was also excellent.  I know because I tried it! We will certainly be back again.  Our compliments to the chef.</body>

        <body>The Prado is a restaurant with great ambiance and is located in Balboa Park. During the December holiday season the Park is lit up with a good many holiday lights and feels festive. The Prado does a good job with thier holiday decorations as well. We sat outside on Christmas eve. Many tables are close to gas heaters but ours was not. We still were comfortable in sweaters and light jackets. The menu for Christmas Eve (and Christmas day) was a fixed menu consisting of a starter, main course and desert. The salad was good, the salmon caviar was not (the toast was stale). The Seabass and accompanying vegetable were warm and excellent. 2 of us ordered the New York strip and were told that they served it &quot;near medium&quot; only but would try to accomodate my request for medium rare. The waiter did a good job of securing a medium rare strip for me. Unfortunately the steak was merely warm as were the potatos, and the brussel sprouts were cold, hard and uneatable for me. The chocolate hazelnut mous</body>

        <body>It&apos;s hard to find it all! Nice atmosphere, good food, great service, and somewhat reasonable pricing. I have been to the Prado a few times and have enjoyed it each time. Though I wouldn&apos;t go here often for normal dinner plans it is a good special occasion place.</body>

        <body>We ate at the Prado before an Old Globe Theater performance and enjoyed it very much.  The pre-fixe $39 menu for 2 is a tremendous value and the food was plentiful and delicious.  No doubt, we will return.</body>

        <body>What a fantastic lunch! My friend Steve is here from Paris and I know it would be a perfect place to take him. Lisa &amp; the rest of the wait staff was attentive, knowledgeable, fun &amp; festive. From our drinks to our delicious salad, it was a great afternoon!</body>

        <body>The food is always fantastic, the location is beautiful and the prices are more than reasonable for what you get and where you are.  Their mango iced tea is a favorite.  Everything we have ordered here we love.  We live in boston but make a point to come here anytime we are in the San Diego area.</body>

        <body>Not cutting edge food, but reliably good food, beautifully prepared and served.  All servers are well trained and polished.  The view at the Prado is beyond scenic, of the parklands established for the 1915 Panama Pacific Exhibition here.  Its fault would be in the esthetics.  Worn out garlands on the wall, faded topiaries yellowed with age.  A bunch of detritus and old decorative prints, burdened with faded ribbons swagged over the frames.  It all looks faded and dusty.  They need an interior design renovation.</body>

        <body>whenever we hv outa-towners, we try to fit in a meal at the Prado. the location makes it convenient, as Balboa Park&apos;s treasures (e.g., museums, theaters) are beacons of delight.   our Wednesday eve dine was no exception to all we&apos;ve come to enjoy, and because there wasn&apos;t much of a January chill, the heat lamp above our table was enough to keep us comfortable outside. our waiter was 100% efficient &amp; personable, but the server who brought water shortly after we were seated seemed to be offended when i refused the ice water, &amp; requested water without ice!   at the meal&apos;s end, a manager came to our table &amp; we had only good things to say. (i was so pleased, i forgot to mention the water incident tho i know she would have wanted to know--so here it is, and is the reason for 4 rather than 5 service stars)   we&apos;ll surely be back!</body>

        <body>Our dining experience was enjoyable, the black bean soup and ceaser salad for starters was very tasteful. Along with our entrees, the winter medley risotto and braised short-ribs with veggies and potatoes was remarkable. Our waiter was knowledgeable, and delightful, but not too attentive which we prefer, and our table was in an enjoyable part of the patio.  Thank you prado!</body>

        <body>Food was good, but nothing exceptional and was over priced.  Need to look at varying the menu.  Service was very slow even though the restaurant was not busy.  Ambiance on the edge of the patio was great.</body>

        <body>The Prado&apos;s food is always consistently fresh, yummy and nicely presented. We eat there almost every time we go to the Old Globe and we have never been disappointed. The service is wonderful.  The portions are big enough to fill you up but not so big it&apos;s a ridiculous plate of food. The prices are reasonable and the location cannot be beat. Plus they are always great about getting us out on time for the show.</body>

        <body>set in Balboa Park, a San Diego gem, the food is terrific and the setting is romantic.  With San Diego weather, outdoor dinning should be the choice.  Their duct breast was excellent, as was the lobster/mussels pasta dish.  Price was reasonable.</body>

        <body>Went to Prado before the theatre and we were pleasantly surprised to be there for the date night Tuesday special which was quite a bargain with two entrees and a bottle of wine for $40! Food was great and we had a nice table on the patio with a great server.  However, can&apos;t say the same for the bar. We arrived early thinking we&apos;d have a drink before the restaurant opened at 5:00 and sat at a table for 15 minutes with no wait staff approaching us.  The bus boy brought plates and I asked for some water and for him to send the waiter over. I finally had to practically tackle a waiter who approached the table next to us to take their order and they had just seated themselves.  Apparently we had gone invisible or something. I did get my glass of wine just as they called our table for seating so the host helped me carry it in to our table. The bar scene was just plain annoying, but the dinner certainly made up for it.</body>

        <body>The Prado has the winning combination of great food, excellent service and a relaxed dining environment.    When I bring guests they all find something they enjoy. Noise level can sometimes get high, just ask for table on the perimeter or outside.  Wish valet parking drop off had not moved.  When I bring elderly guests, the extra walking is a problem.  Distance may seem minimal but to someone who has difficulty it is major! Please try to change this.</body>

        <body>Have eaten here many times before, but this was a disaster. Went for their anniversary &quot;special&quot; with two friends. Orders taken promptly, and got our salads and wine quickly, but then waited 45 minutes until we asked our waiter where our entrees were. He went to the kitchen and brought them back then, but they were cold...obviously had been sitting for some time. Waiter did what he could including replacing one of the dishes and comping us with that entree and a free dessert, but this is a poor showing for this restaurant on an evening they should have anticipated would be busy (due to the special).</body>

        <body>Dining at The Prado makes any occasion special.  I made reservations in advance to celebrate a friend&apos;s birthday lunch  on the outdoor patio,  and drove 1 1/2 hours to do so,  and it was so worth it.    The food was great,  the service, exceptional.  The atmosphere on the patio, lush and inviting.  Our server Lisa was attentive and made sure that we wanted for nothing.  After lunch,  a stroll around Balboa Park made for a wonderful and memorable afternoon.  I highly recommend The Prado restaurant.</body>

        <body>we decided to go to Prado due to it&apos;s location to the Old Globe.  What a pleasant surprise. The food was wonderful.  I had the pork prime rib which was so tender/great and my husband had the salmon also extremely good.  We are going again this weekend.  Definitely looking forward to it.  The best was part was our waitress.  She knew we were a bit rushed due to traffic and going to the Old Globe and she did everything possible to get our food to us quickly.  All and All fantastic experience!!!</body>

        <body>It was noon and it took an hour to get our order. The food was fine, but not as unique as previously. Management gave a generous comp for the delay, but.............. Will try other area restaurants next time. It seemed like the waiter help was new. They were friendly but not on top of things.</body>

        <body>We got the perfect 2 top table on the edge of the Patio, where it was quiet and secluded.  The food was wonderful (grilled fish tacos and the portobello salad with chicken). And then we splurged on dessert - a flan with fresh fruit and an almond cookie.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  All in all, a perfect lunch for a busy Friday.</body>

        <body>Every year my son and I, sometimes with several others along, purchase tickets to see The Grinch (stage play) at The Old Globe Theatre in Balboa Park. To add to the perfect day kicking off our Christmas season celebration we make reservations at The Prado for either lunch or dinner. This year, as we were making the drive from Los Angeles to San Diego, it was clear that the trffic wouldn&apos;t allow us to make our lunch reservation and with a phone call to the restaurant we were able to switch to a dinner reservation. Score one for The Prado! It&apos;s hard to explain how much my son, who has autism, looks forward to eating the pasta with meat sauce at The Prado. He talks about it throughout the year. Well, this year we found it missing from the menu. Gulp! I asked the waiter about it and shared that it&apos;s the meal my son looks forward to all year. The waiter said it&apos;s now only available for lunch. I am a very undemanding patron myself and teach my son to be as well, but given his yearlong build</body>

        <body>Have eaten here many times and its proximity to the features of Balboa Park is awesome.  Food is great with a good variety.  Good service, friendly atmosphere, good drinks.  When the weather is nice it is great to sit outside on their terrace.  Comfortable bar with delicious appetizers and &quot;bar food.&quot;  The decor is in keeping with the older &quot;Spanish&quot; style of many of the buildings in the park and creatively decorated.  It&apos;s a Cohn restaurant, so you know it&apos;s going to be quality.  Highly recommend!  (And try the calamari appetizer....it&apos;s not your basic fried pieces.....it&apos;s strips of calamari in a delicious sauce served on a great salad/slaw that is the perfect accompaniment.)  Also the hummus and flatbread that is brought to the table as you are ordering is delish.  Love this place!</body>

        <body>My husband and I love to dine at The Prado whenever we come to Balboa Park.  The food is always outstanding and the service is consistently excellent even when they are very busy.  The view is gorgeous, even when inside the restaurant near a window.    Don&apos;t miss The Prado!</body>

        <body>My boyfriend and I have been to The Prado several times throughout the past few years, as we live right by the park. We normally come for their late night happy hour and enjoy sitting at the bar with their cocktails and appetizers. We always enjoy ourselves and the location is nice. We most recently came for the $39.99 Tuesday Date Night special that we&apos;ve seen advertised. For that price, you get two entrees and a bottle of wine. The boyfriend had the pork prime rib that came with mashed potatoes and some type of greens. It was good, he liked the mustard crust on the prime rib, but it wasn&apos;t over the top amazing. I had the paella, sans the chicken. It was not my favorite. It had tons of chorizo, which overtook the meal and I didn&apos;t feel as though the seafood was as fresh as could be. I ate about half of it, but couldn&apos;t eat the leftovers. I am not saying the seafood was bad (I didn&apos;t get sick or anything), but it was just slightly off putting to me. Overall, I would return to The Prad</body>

        <body>However, the last 2 times, the service has been so slow, and even though we made the reservation with enough time for a show, and the servers assured us we would have plenty of time, we were served over 1 hr after we arrived and had to race through our entree and dessert.  It was additionally frustrating because we had to ask the server to please bring our food 3 times, and he never acknowledged or apologized for the delay.  The food was delicious, as usual, but we could not enjoy it at all because we had to eat what we could in 10 minutes.  We could only have a bite of our dessert as we were getting up from the table. The service on my past 2 visits have definitely diminished my love for The Prado.</body>

        <body>The Prado is always a great place to eat, particularly if you in Balboa Park.  The Lobster Seafood Pasta was incredible as was the Sea Bass.  The Court Yard Dining area is the quietiest dining room at the Prado, and is just lovely.  Alternatively on a warm evening, the patio dining is hard to beat for atmosphere.  The service could not have been better...but then we ate early and there was not much of a crowd.    If you are in Balboa Park you must dine here, and even if you aren&apos;t in the Park it is certainly worth the drive to have such a wonderful dining experience.</body>

We took the sorbet for desert and it was served with a grilled coconut tile. Marvellous! The lady who served us was very helpful and all the personal.</body>

        <body>The &quot;spicy&quot; calimari fries were mushy and sweet, not crispy and spicy.  The mild marina over pasta on the kid&apos;s menu was too spicy to eat as they put pepper in the red sauce for kids.  The fish tacos were really bad.  Salad was good.  The chile relleno was odd, but OK.  Food service delivery from the kitchen was slow, so lunch took a long time.  If this restaurant were not located on the Prado as a stop in between museums, it would not make it.</body>

        <body>When you dine at a restaurant frequently over a number of years you are bound to have a bad experience occasionally.   Not so with The Prado.  The service, ambiance and food are consistently good.  We ordered the  Pan Roasted Seabass: corn, pancetta, asparagus, spinach, shaved fennel, preserved lemons, white truffle corn puree.   It was an unusual combination that worked beautifully.  Delicious!</body>

        <body>This is a must-return restaurant for us, every time we visit San Diego.  And the experiences keep getting better every time we go there!  After my wife &amp; I started out with salads, I had the salmon and short ribs combo while my wife enjoyed the roasted chicken &amp; grits.  Both were extraordinary!  We shared chocolate/orange bread pudding for dessert.  Our server, Lisa, was phenomenal!  Knowledgeable about Balboa Park, knowledgeable about the food, &amp; extremely personable as well.  There&apos;s many reasons why this restaurant is noted in publications like Gourmet Magazine for it&apos;s excellence, but all I&apos;d tell you is, GO!  It&apos;s a great place!</body>

        <body>It was my friend&apos;s birthday. We had a 1pm showing at the Reuben H. Fleet and told our waiter when he arrived. He was very accommodating, watching the time and making sure we didn&apos;t feel rushed. The portebello mushroom salads we enjoyed were so very delicious as was the iced tea and wonderful Voss sparkling water. I have been coming to the Prado for years. While service has been good, lately we&apos;ve experienced impeccable service where the wait staff go well beyond what is expected. One waiter even gave us information on Voss. We are both Norwegian so we were intrigued by this. Our waiter brought over a vanilla bean cheesecake that was the proverbial &quot;frosting on the cake&quot; with a candle for my friend to blow out. He made sure we got to the theater on time. Excellent service, delicious food, beautiful ambience. The Prado has it all!</body>

        <body>Made reservations for 4 people and showed up with 7. Instead of giving us any kind excuses or grief they promptly worked fast to accommodate our party and all with a smile.   Food was delicious and they had no problems splitting the bill at the end if the night.</body>

        <body>3rd visit to this gem . . . Love the Art Glass . . . Food was expertly done especially Salmon, which a lot of fine restaurants still overcook.  Service was unbelievably nice and attentive even though the place was packed.</body>

        <body>The Prado is one of our favorite restaurants.  Most often we will stop by and have the Calamari.  It is delicious.  This time we experienced the restaurant week menu and the food was superb.  Our server was very attentive and quite pleasant.</body>

        <body>We thought the service was great, had a very nice and friendly waitress.  The food, not so good. Our sea bass was over cooked and it did not taste like sea bass.  We did love the chocolate dessert with marshmellow ice cream.</body>

        <body>It&apos;s such a beautiful restaurant with upscale food but I was very disappointed when I had to use the park&apos;s public restaurant. The other restaurant&apos;s customers were complaining as well.</body>

        <body>Pre-theater dinner at the Prado (before Buyer and Cellar) was fantastic!  The three of us were smitten with the Five P Salad (two of us put a piece of grilled salmon on top) - intriguingly delicious ingredients melded together in a flavor explosion!  Complemented by a Blood Orange Martini - this may be my favorite meal of all time!  The Prado graciously held our reservation on a very busy night while we were &apos;parked&apos; on 163; service (by Ian) was terrific and if you call The Prado, I hope you reach Mark, because he&apos;ll make you laugh.  I&apos;d go back every night if I could.</body>

        <body>It was Day 1 of Restaurant Week at lunch plus MLK Jr. Holiday, the Monday of a 3 day weekend. Restaurant was operating at capacity but Prado was fully prepared as there was ample staff and they were friendly and efficient. Service was fast and food was well prepared. My only complaint was that the inside restaurant was noisy but that happens when restaurants are full.  Overall, a very nice experience.  Its always good to see well trained, efficient, and friendly staff who are fully prepared for very busy days.  Our reservations were for 1:30 and we arrived then and were seated within 5 minutes.  I definitely recommend making reservations to avoid a wait at this popular restaurant.</body>

        <body>The menu has something for everyone.  It doesn&apos;t matter if you eat inside or out, although outside has more distractions - as you can watch the planes as they get ready to land at Lindberg field.  Service is always top notch - your service staff makes you feel special.  We do not drink alcohol so can&apos;t comment on that menu.</body>

        <body>This is one of my favorite places, but I downgraded the food this time because  the item I ordered, the skewers from the appetizer menu were very dry and overcooked (we had ordered a lot of other group appetizers, calamari, won tons, etc...which were excellent). It is not an inexpensive place, so the quality of the food must be commensurate for all dishes. Overall still a favorite.</body>

<author>OpenTable.com</author>
        <body>Classic Italian dishes with a contemporary flair have made Trattoria No.10 a Chicago favorite since 1989. Specialties on the daily menu include unique, homemade ravioli, rustic pastas, freshly prepared risotto, fresh fish selections and grilled filet of beef. The subdued elegance of the interior, with arched walkways, murals and original art provides an intimate atmosphere that is perfect for business lunches, pre-theater dining, romantic dinners or private parties.</body>

        <body>We enjoyed our dinner at Trattoria No. 10.  The veal scallopine, served with kale and caper berries, was delicious.  I also really liked the butternut squash ravioli. Service was excellent. I recommend reservations; by 5:45 on a Saturday evening, the restaurant was full.</body>

        <body>Went here before seeing the Book of Mormon and it was a good choice. Nice restaurant with great food. The lobster ravioli was superb. Our waitress could&apos;ve been a bit more attentive, especially given it was early (5) and not too many tables in the area. Overall, I&apos;d go back for the food alone, so I do recommend it. I would go back. Cute, romantic place.</body>

        <body>I loved my lobster ravioli and house salad.  I ordered the small plate of ravioli which was a lot cheaper and, with the salad, was enough for a meal.  Very gourmet!</body>

        <body>We had excellent food and service all night. While we&apos;ve been rushed through pre-theatre dinners before, they paced themselves so we had enough time for dessert, and never felt hurried.  Food was terrific, as always.</body>

        <body>I was disappointed for the first time at Trattoria No. 10-ordered the new fish item and it was fair and not very warm-wondered if it sat in the kitchen. My friend enjoyed her meal.</body>

        <body>I went with two other ladies on a Monday night. We started at 6pm and it was pretty quiet for the most part, but then as it got later, more and more people came in. We didn&apos;t mind that the place was more populated, though we had up to that point been spoiled by how much attention and the fantastic service we got!   We loved everything that we ate, including the complimentary bread. We all started with the soup of the day (creamy mushroom) and then shared everything else: wild mushroom crostini, roasted organic beets, ravioli with butternut and acorn squash, house made herb pappardelle pasta (also has wild mushrooms), and lemon mascarpone cheesecake. I confess I was a bit mushroomed-out so if I did it again, I would&apos;ve had the minestrone soup instead, or have not ordered the crostini. This was our own fault though - the waitress even double-checked to make sure we knew how much mushroom we were ordering.  Overall, we had a great time and will be coming back.</body>

        <body>This is the perfect restaurant for dinner before a in the theater district.  They ask when you arrive if you are going to a show.  Thy then plan your dinning experience perfectly.    I mistakenly left my credit card and they called to notify me.  They held it for me until after the play.  It seemed the hostess stayed late to make sure I got my card back.</body>

Our waitress was not nice to us at all. The waitress had an attitude and placed the utensils as though we had asked her to clean the bathroom. She kept checking if we were ready to pay while we were having dessert!  We would have stayed longer, but we felt we were not welcome. The funny thing is she completely gave a different attitude to the next table.  I think she thought we were tourists, so she didn&apos;t have to be nice to us. I don&apos;t think I will be back there.  The food was very nice, but I don&apos;t wanna pay for the unfriendly service.</body>

        <body>The food was delicious.  There were so many dishes we wanted to try.  We each ordered  different salads and entrees so that we could try each others dish.  All of then were perfect.  It was my guest&apos;s birthday and they brought her a dessert on a plate wishing her happy birthday.  She was so pleased.</body>

        <body>Some of the besdt Italian in Chicago and the waiter was impeccable.   The wine list is extensive but not cumbersome. Courses were saerved with the coreect amount of spacing - not too long between courses but not rushing you either.</body>

        <body>This is the place to go if you are seeing a show in the theater district. Your car is valed, and held for you until after the show, all for less than 20$. The food was amazing! My husband had the spicey sausage ravioli and I had the scallops- both delicious! Also great cocktail and craft beer list. This will be our go to place for a Pre-show dinner!</body>

        <body>We had booked this as a compromise for a group of six diners - two from Hyde Park and two from Andersonville and two hotel guests near north.  unfortunately despite a reservation we were kept waiting a full 45 minutes after our reservation time - with one of the group having just flown in from India this was really untenable- actually it would be untenable regardless.  the front desk was unconcerned and told us we could sit and eat in the bar (not conducive to catching up with old friends after several years) - we passed and said no we would wait for the table we had RESERVED -   meal was actually good - and the service was attentive once we actually got to sit down but this one certainly won&apos;t be on my &quot;return to&quot; list.</body>

        <body>One of us does not favor polenta; the other is not enthused about mushrooms. Neither seldom, if ever order, fish. So the whitefish with mushrooms and polenta were absolutely astonishing. What flavor and texture. Fish and mushrooms had tooth; not overcooked dumbdums. The polenta was creamy and rich in flavor. The ravioli as a starter were a revelation in what fresh pasta is all about.  The pastry dough on the apple crostata was to perfection. And the restaurant is beautifully conversation friendly.</body>

        <body>Had a very good meal, they are used to the theatre crowd and our waiter David did a great job of spacing our meal without feeling rushed. My Osso Buco was fantastic. Beet salad also very good. My wife had the lamb and it was also very good. Lots of great restaurants in Chicago, but if you are going to a show and want to eat close by, would highly recommend this. All the major venue&apos;s are within a short 2 or 3 block walk. Park in the Block 37 ramp. Save the other restaurants for when you have more time.</body>

        <body>The service is always very good at Trattoria No. 10, and we had an excpetional server on Saturday evening, not rushing us and offering advice when asked.  My husband and I have eaten at the restaurant  before, enjoying the food each time.  This time however, the appetizers were out of this world in both presentation and taste.  I took a photo of the beet ravioli salad because the presentation was so beautiful!  My husband tried the sausage raviolis which were topped with a generous portion of parmesan cheese.  Both our dinners were outstanding, and the new Steelhead and spinach main course was wonderful and savory.  The linguini with shrimp was a full meal with shrimp filling the bowl.  Dessert did not disappoint us - the presentation and flavor of the warm chocolate cake with chocolate sauce is a chocolate lovers dream!</body>

        <body>We tried to get into Petterino&apos;s before we went to the Goodman and they were booked.  So we tried this instead and we were not disappointed at all!  They&apos;re known for their ravioli and I know why...it was the most delicate pasta I have ever eaten and the fillings (we got one squash order and one asparagus order) was amazing!   Service was also great - they were sensitive to our theater schedule and took care of us accordingly.</body>

        <body>The service at Trattoria No. 10 was fantastic. The environment was romantic enough for a dinner date but also comfortable enough for a group outing or special occasion. I am not a wine drinker, so I cannot comment on the abundant wine list. The bar was equipped with many other beverages, though, for whatever your taste. Honestly, I expected the food to be better. I cannot eat most meats or any dairy, so, granted, this wasn&apos;t the best choice for me. I ordered the minestrone soup to start and the mahi as the entre. The minestrone was delicious; definitely my favorite part of the meal. It was hearty but in a light broth. It was loaded with all kinds of cooked, but crunchy vegetables. The Mahi, on the other hand, was mediocre. The vegetables it came with were perfect and the butter sauce it was accompanied with was light and tasty. But the fish itself did not have much flavor and was a tad overcooked and dry. Other than that, it was a great experience!</body>

        <body>My friend and I made reservations here for a girls night out before seeing a show based on good online reviews. The restaurant was mostly empty yet they sat us near a back bussing station where the waiters hung out and chatted between checking on tables and busers were coming and going regularly. we did not request another table so to be fair I can&apos;t hold that against them too much. The real issue was the waiter and the food. We both ordered salads since we wanted something on the lighter side pre-show. The food was lackluster and generally skimped on all ingredients (other than the greens) and was severely overdressed. Basically they charged $10 for a plate of soggy lettuce with 5 pine nuts in it. Our waiter was unimpressive and had a very strange way of talking to his customers. He used an overly affected tone that came off very patronizing. Overall we just wanted to get out as quickly as possible. There are so many great restaurants in Chicago and next time I will be going elsewher</body>

        <body>Was very hurt that despite spending quite a bit on a steak, you could not modify menu just a little for my adult autistic son. Also, he asked for a steak sauce and never received one.  I know that your steak was delicious without it, but autistic people are &quot;set&quot; in their ways, They cannot help it.  My entree was cold upon receiving, but by this time, I was just wanting to get to our scheduled show, so I did not say anything.  Poor experience I am sorry to say.  He left a nice tip despite this as that is how kind he is. we were hoping for another experience. M</body>

        <body>We enjoyed our meal and having viewed Trattoria&apos;s video online, we were interested in trying the homemade ravioli.  I had the spinach &amp; lobster ravioli and my daughter had the asparagus and red pepper ravioli.  Our server was especially mindful that we were trying to make a 7pm curtain at the Cadillac Palace to see Cinderella.  My only criticism is that our server (who was outstanding overall), did not mention that there were 1/2 and full portions of these entree&apos;s. We were automatically served the full portion, when in hindsight we would have preferred 1/2 portions so that dessert might have been an option.</body>

My wife loved the wild mushroom appetizer. The only negative was the parking, it cost us $17.00 to park.</body>

        <body>Took a friend&apos;s advice to try No. 10 -- he&apos;d eaten there years ago and remembered it fondly.  This was the best meal we had in Chicago.  The standout appetizer was baked baby pumpkins, delicious and cute!  We both had the lobster ravioli and it was sooo good.  I wish I had some now.</body>

        <body>The best part of dinner was the spinach salad and carpaccio. I though the ravioli (I had shrimp) was overrated. Just a pretty mediocre dining experience overall. It didn&apos;t feel particularly warm or special.</body>

        <body>Went before the symphony on a  Thursday night.  Even though the restaurant was very full, we had no problem getting our food served promptly.  The gnocchi were fantastic and the homemade ravioli with butternut and acorn squash were even better.  Since they make the ravioli fresh every day, I highly recommend it.  My wife had the chicken breast with the panko bread crumbs, which was a little bland, although the mushrooms served with it added some flavor.  Overall it was a very good experience.</body>

        <body>this time, we took advantage of Trattoria No. 10 Restaurant Week menu and we were NOT disappointed.  if you haven&apos;t had the pleasure of dining here before and are not familiar with the menu, i would recommend going this route.  i also like the option that TT#10 gave us; in lieu of a dessert, you could substitute a glass of wine, which i did, a lovely pinot grigio.  enjoy!  and David you were the best!</body>

        <body>It was a birthday celebration for our group.  Once we told the server, he took care of it and presented with a lovely decorated plate which had both a chocolate covered strawberry as well as a piece of Tiramisu with a candle.  Very attentive service, great foot, and a nice atmosphere.  I will be visiting once again.</body>

        <body>Excellent food, in the Theater District where there is a void of good places.  Plain honest good-not gimmicky or trendy. Quiet for conversation without having to yell.  Only knock is it is too pricey; I do not go here unless I  am going to the theater afterwards.</body>

        <body>I dined here for dinner with two business associates on a cold, winter Friday. The place was relatively quiet due to the weather but that did not prevent our (male) server from giving us great attention. The Wild Mushroom Risotto was amazing (enjoyed the smaller / appetizer portion) and the other entrées were delightful. The drinks are on the strong side as well. Best of all, the chef sources ingredients locally, when possible and the Organic Chicken was wonderful.</body>

        <body>Trattoria No. 10 has become a favorite spot for my wife &amp; I. A family member recommended this place, and we have yet to have a bad meal, a bad drink or bad service. Every time we&apos;ve gone--be it earlier as they open, or later in the evening--the food is always outstanding and the entire experience is one to remember.  The restaurant sources their food locally (as much as possible) and while it&apos;s not a requirement for us, I do appreciate reading the back of the menu to see where today&apos;s menu (the menu changes daily!) is sourced.  Highly recommended. The price for the meal is commensurate for what you receive--portions are perfect every single time. Never too small, never too much…just right.</body>

        <body>I love this place, and try to go as often as possible.  Our waiter this time was exceptional.  And the food always exceptional.  One of my favorite places to go.   My friend even suggested we meet there more often in the bar, to sample the Happy Hour there.   My go to food is the Butternut Squash ravioli.    Great every time.  But I know there are many other great dishes, as when I go with my husband and other friends, they order something else, and I get to taste it.   Thanks for being consistent.</body>

        <body>You will find this restaurant downstairs which provides a buffer from the traffic above. It is like eating in a cozy wine cellar. The staff is attentive and the food is excellent. Romantic with low enough sound level for easy conversation.</body>

        <body>Very good food, a very dependable restaurant. I&apos;ve been many times and most people I send there have never been to Trattoria No. 10. I love the bar menu and the pasta dishes - it&apos;s absolutely worth it for both reasons!</body>

        <body>We managed to have a variety of items for dinner.  First the opportunities for improvement: 1) My wife ordered the N.Y. Strip with no pink (medium well was recommended).  It was a thick cut (similar to a Filet) and it came very pink.  They attempted to cook it further and it was still pink.  The manager was involved in both cases.  My wife told them she did not want the steak.  The chef came to our table and asked for a second chance to make it right.  My wife relented and the meat came with no pink but  a bit tough.  They did not charge us for the steak (without us asking).  In my opinion, they should not offer a thick cut as this more than medium.  The attention and service to make this right for us was outstanding.  They gave us soup and dessert with no charge and even offered to give me a new meal so I could eat at the same time as my wife.    2) The ravioli, Steelhead and Gnudi were very good.</body>

        <body>We picked Trattoria 10 before attending a play at the Goodman because it is only a couple of blocks away.  The atmosphere is relaxing and sophisticated.  Every member of the staff was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient.  Even the server who brought the bread to the table explained what was in the spread that came with the bread.  We ordered from the Chicago Restaurants Week special menu.  The food was outstanding - even the olive oil was unusually tasty. I had the &quot;squid ink tagliatelle pasta&quot; which was a generous portion including an ample amount of seafood.  The chocolate truffle cake for dessert was crusty on the outside with warm oozing chocolate in the middle and delicious dark chocolate throughout.  It is the best I&apos;ve ever had at a restaurant.</body>

        <body>Trattoria No. 10 is a favorite. I&apos;m confident to bring out of town guests there because the experience is always perfect. The birthday reward program is a wonderful way to re-experience the restaurant in a celebratory way. A good choice any time, Trattoria No. 10 is quite convenient for pre-theater dinners.</body>

Great place to eat before theater but be sure to allow enough time to enjoy your delicious meal.   Also , you will be able to have a great conversation with your table mates!</body>

        <body>Trattoria No. 10 is quiet and comfortable for either a couple having a date or a group of old friends stirring up a storm. The Italian style dining is modernized, lighter and milder than most older establishments, yet still has the old classics like lamb chops or bowtie pasta with duck confit. The waitstaff is courteous and thorough in finding out how exactly you like to have dinner served, with wine first and everything in a certain order, or different dishes coming out simultaneously or even whenever you&apos;re ready for the next course, which I found charming. And the wine service is excellent, with a list of wines that doesn&apos;t stretch to Italy, but is a good enough variety to let even the wine connoisseurs enjoy a glass or share a bottle. It&apos;s a short walk from the Art Institute and the Skydeck, so I would recommend this spot for dinner if you&apos;re ever in Chicago (Art Institute closes at 5, and the Skydeck takes its last lift at 7:30, giving you and your party enough time to have dinne</body>

        <body>A consistently wonderful restaurant.  Butternut squash is one of the best in Chicago.  Service is friendly and not intimidating.  The lower level location feels like Italy.  I never tire of it.  It is a delightful dining experience for lunch, business lunches or dinners, and special occasions as well.  They are also mindful of the time if you have theatre tickets, which is much appreciated.</body>

        <body>Pre-theater dinner for two.  Baby spinach salad, soup and cheese plate starters were very good.  We each had ravioli as main entrees...squash ravioli were very good and sausage ravioli were amazing; highly recommended.  Great texture, taste and  presentation.  Server Michael was excellent.  Looking forward to our next visit.</body>

        <body>I do not know why this is the trend recently at most restaurants I go to - but the temperature of my food has been lukewarm at most places.  Unfortunatley, Trattoria #10 was no exception.  No - I didn&apos;t sent my food back and ask them to reheat it.  I&apos;m tired of doing that everywhere I go.  Why can&apos;t the chef&apos;s keep my food warm.  Are there not warming drawers they could put it in?  Our server was good and overall the food is good - when served hot.</body>

        <body>While some participants in Restaurant Week tried menu items that were different, or smaller, than typical, Trattoria 10 offered full portions of items that also were listed on the regular menu. The ample luncheons we enjoyed provided subsequent take-home dinners that traveled well. We have eaten frequently at this restaurant and have always been impressed with the variety and quality of its Italian fare. We are always seated at the requested reservation time, and we marvel at the teamwork shown by everybody from the greeters to the servers and busy helpers who keep the Trattoria humming like clockwork. It&apos;s just as popular a venue for a group meeting as for a couple celebrating a special occasion.</body>

        <body>We live out of state but when in Chicago we like Trattoria No.10 and have been 3 times. It is downstairs and has a quiet, intimate, secluded feel. Excellent service and friendly staff. Their specialty is homemade ravioli. All pastas come in 2 sizes - appetizer or entree size. We had the butternut squash ravioli with walnut butter as an appetizer. Delish but very rich so 4 pillows was fine for the 3 of us. Son had sausage ravioli entree. Yummy. Hubby had corvina (a fish like mahimahi) served with great veggies. I had scallops on a rich orzo base with spinach. Excellent, but so rich I couldn&apos;t finish. Great wine. I would definitely recommend this place to foodies, but beware of portion sizes because the sauces are so rich. Well worth the calories.</body>

        <body>Have been here several times.  Service is great and food outstanding.  Perfect for lunch or dinner.  Décor and atmosphere are subtle and relaxing, yet upscale.  Try the polenta starter and the roasted veg antipasti.  Of course, homemade pasta is their specialty.  Would highly recommend this wonderful find in the Loop.</body>

        <body>This is the 4th time i&apos;ve eaten at Trattoria No 10 and it has never disappointed me. Their homemade ravioli is to die for - especially the squash raviolli!  I highly recommend this restaurant - you will make it your favorite dining establishment in Chicago!</body>

        <body>We visited here prior to going to a play. We shared several of the ravioli options (all were delicious). We shared a salad which was plenty for two. The Italian wines were very good. We will definitely return, especially if we are going to a play!</body>

        <body>Dined with a group of 6 after a Goodman show. Convenient location, wonderful service, and excellent food. Loved the butternut squash ravioli. My husband had the pasta with sausage. He is Italian and very particular about his sausage as well as tomato sauce. He found both to be outstanding. One of our party had a veal dish and loved it. The rest of us had pasta, and everyone raved.</body>

        <body>We have been here a few times and always the service is perfect, the ambiance is relaxing and romantic and the food good. We feel like they care about every guest, a nice way to run a restaurant. Only suggestion is have some lighter fare for those wanting to go easy on cheese and sauces. Wine list also is excellent. our server, who I did not get his name was terrific with good wine suggestions, very attentive, and helpful. He is what made the mean special.</body>

        <body>Lovely setting, so calm and charming. Service was only fair. The menu is fine. Good wines by the glass and craft beer. Nice pasta and ra violin selections and very expensive entrees. Field greens salad was lightly dressed but still too salty.  Ruined it. The two pastas were over laden with the meats (pork, duck) and so SALT that it was impossible to appreciate the dishes.</body>

        <body>Booked a reservation for 4 to celebrate a birthday lunch for a colleague.  The service here is not super fast - so that may be an issue if you are looking for a quick lunch.  It is, however, a nice central location, has great food and a lovely but quiet atmosphere.  Most of us ordered salads which were lovely and tasty.  One of us ordered ravioli - which are a house specialty and always very good.  The lovely surprise was that the waiter overheard us mentioning we were celebrating a birthday - and he brought a order of the tiramasu - complete with Happy Birthday written on the plate and a candle in the dessert.  It was a fabulous way to end the celebration!  I highly recommend a stop here for lunch or dinner.</body>

        <body>Trattoria 10 is beautifully decorated, warm and homy.  The food is outstanding, especially the ravioli , which is their specialty.  I&apos;ve been going to Trattoria 10 for many years and it will continue to be one of my all time favorites. Another plus is it is located in the heart of Chicago&apos;s theatre district.</body>

        <body>I had not been to Trattoria 10 for a long time. The food was very good. Both my husband and I had Three Sisters roasted polenta as a starter. It had a very flavorful sauce that enhanced the roasted polenta. As a main course I had veal scaloppini with kale which was good but a little too salty for my taste. My husband had the Squid Ink Tagliatelle Pasta which he enjoyed very much but had not realized that it had chili flake which made the spiciness a surprise to him.  We enjoyed our dinner but we both thought that the decor was getting to look a little old.</body>

        <body>I liked the setting however service was inattentive and the food was so so.  We had the mussels and carpaccio as well as two ravioli dishes.  Everything was fine but no wow factor.  Would try something else before going back.</body>

        <title>Vesta Dipping Grill - Denver</title>
<author>OpenTable.com</author>
        <body>Vesta, the Goddess of the Hearth, is the most beautiful of Roman divinities, bright and pure like the flame that is her symbol.  Latins made Vesta a goddess who personified the earth and fire. She presided over the preparation of meals: Vesta was offered the first food and drink. The hearth conjures up visions of domesticity and peace, for the hearth is the traditional center of family life. It symbolizes warmth, security, and companionship a place for dreaming where it becomes possible by peering into the embers, to find physical and mental renewal and a place to discover the secrets of the future. At Vesta Dipping Grill, we have combined these themes to provide a unique dining experience. Vesta is simplicity, quality, comfort, life, art, scent, relaxation, taste, sound, and fun.</body>

        <body>The flat iron steak was juicy and cooked to perfection. :-) The quinoa lemon salad was excellent. I would recommend this place to all of my friends and will be back to enjoy another meal.</body>

        <body>Excellent service. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted amicably. Our waiter, Jesse, very courteous and explained the menu in great detail. Food was fabulous, the dipping sauces complemented very well but not necessary to enjoy the food.   We tried the mixed platter to start. Great taste and variety of cheeses and cold meats. Our party ordered scallops, beef tenderloin, pork tenderloin and duck. All the dishes had great presentations and fresh flavor, the sauces bring out new tastes, but food can be enjoyed without them. Couldn&apos;t choose a winner plate from the ones ordered.   Dessert we enjoyed the pot de creme, a winner.   Just visiting Denver for a night, but if we come back, we will definitely come back to Vesta Dipping Grill.</body>

        <body>First time back in many years and was not disappointed.  Requested a &quot;quiet&quot; location and a booth in the round.  The shape of the enclosure definitely helped keep the noise level down so we could hear the people in our party across the table. Now onto the food...  We took Alex&apos;s suggestions for appetizers and dessert and were not disappointed.  Appetizers were large enough for six of us to sample each one.  Actually, the same for dessert.  Entrees were perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.  So delicious that we did not need the accompanying 3 sauces.  Wines - mmm.</body>

        <body>I have brought my wife, business associates, and customers here.  Every time, whoever I bring, leaves raving about the place.  It usually starts with the food and sauce paring, then the ambiance, and then just the overall experience.  Thank you for the great service and experience!</body>

        <body>We found Vesta Dipping Grill online by looking for something that was close to our hotel.  They had a nice selection of craft beers and the different sauces that came with each dish were a nice touch. Service was knowledgabke and friendly. Would definitely go again.</body>

        <body>We paid over $60 and really only got two appetizers.  The kitchen was super slow and the waitstaff was not helpful when we said we had to go because we had a show to get to.  They blamed us for not telling them we had a show, when in reality, we had given ourselves plenty of time and it should not have been an issue if they had actually been on top of their service.  After waiting 45 minutes after our first two small plates for our entree, we had to leave and asked to not have the entrees brought out, but they brought them anyway and charged us for them when we obviously could not eat them and they would go bad by the time we got home (Hello! We said we were going to a show and would not get to them, they were absolutely disgusting by the time we got home and were starving)  Very bad service and unimpressive food.  Disappointing experience all around.</body>

I love the dipping sauce sampler - highly recommended to try a bunch of sauces before enjoying a main course (only I wish they would put miso and sweet ginger back on the list :).  Wonderful staff and great food!</body>

        <body>Everything, as usual, was outstanding for our Christmas Eve dinner. Tim, our waiter, was amazing and thorough in handling the food allergies of one of the diners. The shrimp, the beef tenderloin and the scallops were delicious! The toffee pudding was amazing as well. And the cocktails and wine ... we knew this place would be a great treat for Christmas Eve and it delivered in every aspect. Thank you!</body>

        <body>Vesta Dipping Grill was a spectacular treat. The service was spot on. The dipping platter and meat board were excellent. The cocktail menu was a lot of fun. My wife and I were here on March 28, 2015. We absolutely will return.  This is a great place for dinner, or a pre game nosh.</body>

        <body>We had a wonderful time this past weekend.  Nick, our server, was outstanding!  He was patient, helpful, made great suggestions and made our experience a special one. The food runners were also very helpful and knowledgeable about what we ordered.  Our food was amazing, the kids menu great too!  I love how the staff served the veggies first, before our son could fill up on pasta.  Desserts were AMAZING!!!!! I&apos;m still dreaming about the desserts.... Thank you for a wonderful experience!!</body>

        <body>It was a nice venue for my daughter and I.  I like to eat at nice restaurants, but they aren&apos;t always kid friendly nor do tragedy have items for the kids to want to eat, as they aren&apos;t always into &quot;grown up&quot; food.  It was perfect.  Our waitress gave us a diverse amount of dips with the flatbread I ordered and we both had things we could enjoy, from ghost pepper to honey and berry dips.  My scallops were amazing and my daughter loved her Mac and cheese and carrots.  I had the hazelnut toffee with sea salt caramel ice cream and she had the cupcake ice cream with hot fudge.  As a three year old, she loved everything, as did I.  Can&apos;t wait to head back with friends, my wife, or my kids soon.</body>

        <body>We came on the Valentine&apos;s Night. The food was outstanding!! My date had the Bison tenderloin. I had the Chorizo Pork tenderloin. We couldn&apos;t understand why the items needed more dipping sauces. They were incredible on their own!  This was our first time coming to Vesta. We will definitely be returning.   Thanks.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve always been a fan of Vesta Dipping Grill, but was disappointed this time around.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, the service was great, as was our server. When I ordered my standard Cosmo he recommended a pear martini that wasn&apos;t on the cocktail menu and I LOVED it.  The entire table had the same drink - twice.  The food was mediocre - not bad, but nothing to cheer about.  The menu seems tired.  We ordered the market fish of the day and several small plates -- again nothing disappointing enough to send back to the kitchen, but nothing to rave about or even recommend.</body>

        <body>Used the Denver Restaurant Week as our opportunity to experience Vesta, mainly due to the fact that they offered vegan options. Service was almost too fast for our first courses but ground to a halt as we waited for dessert. The food was adequate for my husband (he was not impressed with his undercooked salmon) but I loved the vegan salad and entree.  Our desserts were our least favorite course... For the price and as a change, Vesta fit our needs.</body>

        <body>My fiancé and I went for our anniversary and had a wonderful time. While we were there on a Monday and the area was a little dead, I imagine the surrounding neighborhood is quite vibrant on a Friday night or weekend.  The ambience of the place was really unique with exposed wood beams and columns. How could I forget the elaborate metal spiral lights hanging from the ceiling. Overall the space was intimate enough for a romantic evening while still open enough for a business dinner.  Our server was great, explaining the specials and how the menu worked with the complimented dipping sauces. The service was timely without being rushed. Every dish arrived shortly after finishing the previous one.   Lastly the food! We ordered the meat and cheese hors d&quot; ouvres which consisted of some delicious duck and some of there homemade cheese. The main entrees were wonderfully cooked with tons of flavor and so many combinations with each of the sauces. While a little overwhelming there were plenty of</body>

        <body>The sauces here are no gimmick, though most of our dishes didn&apos;t really need them. A fun night out experimenting, nonetheless. Killer cocktail and spirits menu. Treated my wife on her birthday, and they nailed some of the small touches that I usually don&apos;t care about when I dine out, but today they were really appreciated. Great experience.</body>

        <body>The food creativity was good but didn&apos;t execute very well. Pork tenderloin was way undercooked. Tuna in the roll didn&apos;t taste very fresh. The sauce they marinated the Chinese broccoli was way too vinegary. But the service was good. And I like having all the different dipping sauces.  Also I called and was told that there is validated parking in the bank parking. So we parked there. Turns out it&apos;s not exactly validated completely. It&apos;s a whopping $2 off. Had we known that we would&apos;ve done street parking or a closer lot and saved ourselves the walk in the snow.</body>

        <body>The idea behind the restaurant is stunning.  All the basic meats are there and you choose the dips and sauces you want  although they can  come with chef&apos;s recommendations. The sauces are very  inventive. Many  I hadn&apos;t come across before and the ones I tried were delicious. Excellent service, wines and beers. The venison and cheese sausages are a must? This is a really high quality  restaurant  and would grace any city..</body>

        <body>We came back for restaurant week and were not disappointed. They actually give each person 3 courses (others have you share at least one or two courses). Also the meals were full servings like their regular menu.  Outside of the great deal the food is always cooked perfectly. We had the German meatballs and they tasted just like we&apos;re were in Munich! We also had the pork and steak for main dishes and they were tender and flavorful! To end the night we had the bread pudding and it was the right texture and not huge. We left full but not painfully full. Love this place!</body>

Portions large enough to take some home. Service outstanding,everyone was very knowledgeable about food, friendly and timely. Will return soon.</body>

        <body>Used to really like Vesta, but not so much now. Very expensive mediocre food and small portions. Very expensive wine list poured into Furrs-style Libbey glasses. $38 for under 4 ounces of red snapper?  Really?</body>

        <body>Ridiculously great food.  Service was impeccable. The server was so knowledgeable with an incredibly complicated menu. So often  today good service is interpreted as &quot;more service&quot;.  Never felt rushed.  The artful training of the staff was evident.  This may be the best meal I ever had in 40 years of living in Denver!</body>

        <body>The surprise is not that the dipping sauces are interesting and fun but that each plate arrives beautifully prepared, presented  and flavorful on its own to begin with. The service was also extraordinary given the complexity of navigating us through the sauce selection to our personal tastes. We were impressed by the team service approach so that everything came out in a timely fashion despite the full capacity crowd on a Friday night. Only regret was not having 4 other people with us to really experience the menu!</body>

        <body>Everything was great, we did the 5280 menu and the food and wine pairings were wonderful. Most notable was the pork loin which was the best I think I have ever had. I also wish we would have ordered two of the chocolate desserts simply because the port pairing was spot on.</body>

        <body>The dipping bread with our choice of 5 sauces from a list of maybe 20 or more was great, but then with our entrees, which were already sauced quite nicely, we were asked to choose three more sauces to go with them.  Too gimmicky for  my taste - the food was fine as it was, we didn&apos;t need a total of about 12 sauce dishes littering our table to have it all &quot;work&quot; for me.  Interestingly, my 17 year old son thought the same - over the top!  Either that or by agreeing with me thinks I&apos;ll raise his allowance.....</body>

        <body>We had the filet and scallops... both were decadent!  Selecting the sauces is fun, and each provides for a slightly different flavor with your entree.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  I opted to try the house cab (instead of ordering a bottle) and was delightfully surprised.  The one slight draw back was the noise level, we found it difficult to hear one another.  Once the food came we were much more interested in eating anyways!  Great meal!</body>

        <body>Took my girlfriend there for her birthday Monday night.  Everything was incredible.  The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable.  Sean, our waiter, had great recommendations.  We had the scallops and the pork tenderloin.  Both were perfect.  The chef made a crème brulee popsicle for my girlfriend.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone for any occasion.</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been to Vesta a number of times in the past, though not in the past year. I think the only reason we don&apos;t eat there more often whenever we can afford to is that it&apos;s in LoDo and not the most convenient location for us. But we ventured out in the horrible snow-blowing-sideways weather for dinner there because it is worth it. As soon as we walked in dripping with snow, the hostess offered us a warm towel to get the snow off our faces, and the hostess and waiter seated us with hot drinks immediately. My porkbelly chef&apos;s taste was tender and generous for a chef&apos;s bite. They also provided an additional &apos;bite&apos; a little cup of tortilla soup to welcome us. I had to refrain from licking the plate of curry left over from the Icelandic cod that melted in my mouth. My pork tenderloin was tender and well-seasoned and the green chili polenta was just spicy enough with lots of green chili flavor, but not too much. and the chocolate bread pudding, something I don&apos;t normally order, was perfectl</body>

        <body>Vesta has long been one of my favorite downtown Denver dinner spots. Unique food, great service, and all of the sauces are so fun to try. Definitely a place to experience, which I&apos;d recommend  to anybody, particularly those who love food adventures!</body>

        <body>Went here on a rec and glad I did. It was the perfect cap to my girlfriend&apos;s weekend trip to CO. Dimly lit, romantic, quiet enough to chat across the table. The server was fantastic. Every bit of food was delicious. The drinks were outstanding. I would definitely come here again.</body>

        <body>Great ambiance... Lively and warm atmosphere . Food was tasty and elevated. Service was good except I have them 4 stars instead of 5 because I told the restaurant and hostess that my husband and I were celebrating our birthdays (we&apos;re both March)  and the server didn&apos;t even acknowledge that it was our birthdays... We spent $140 for 2 people and No birthday dessert, not even a mention of Happy Birthday. Not sure if the hostess just didn&apos;t communicate it or they just don&apos;t do anything for there clients for birthdays?</body>

        <body>Remove the table jammed in the corner next to the hallway bathroom right out front by the kitchen.  Since the hallway and corner are so narrow, basically people have to sit in your lap while you are eating waiting for another person to clear the hallway.  Seems like I always get stuck at this table.</body>

        <body>Vesta is a great place for a fancy date night -- definitely an excuse to dress up a little and enjoy a night with your significant other. Great wine list, both by the glass and bottle, and they have allergy friendly menus for both the gluten-free and dairy-free. Speaking only on the gluten-free menu, almost all of the entrees are the same, with one or two exceptions, and they offer a good amount of sauces that are gluten free (the only gluten that really exists is because of the soy sauce). My recommendation every time is the venison. Cooked to perfection, doesn&apos;t taste game-y and the fries, cherry, and mushrooms make it a party in your mouth. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a nicer meal (note: more expensive than most places, but totally worth it).</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been here a couple times, but this was my first time for restaurant week. Keeping in mind that the $30 price means that you will be getting your money&apos;s worth. The portions were all right, and the food was pretty good. I got the salmon and it was alright, but I wouldn&apos;t really recommend it, and the ramen it was served on tasted like it was just the maruchan ramen from the store.   The appetizers were amazing, and the korean pork belly was delicious, although a very small portion size despite being an extra $3. You really only get one bite. My boyfriend and I both didn&apos;t think much of the wine pairings that the restaurant selected, so I would suggest going with your own choices.   Beyond that, the service was pretty attentive. They were very busy, and the restaurant was definitely over packed with tables being almost uncomfortably close together. We waited a bit longer than preferred between courses, but I&apos;m sure that was only due to volume.   I&apos;ve gone days other than restaurant </body>

It also comes with crackers, apple slices and bread. And, sauces too. We shared the pork entre. You get to pick sauces from a long list of options. Truly a fun and unique experience. Service was outstanding.</body>

        <body>Vesta has a great atmosphere and an excellent staff. We felt very well taken care of. With that said, the food was very bland. I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s the product of being a &quot;dipping grill&quot; and the ability to bury mediocre food in rich sauces, but there was no creativity.  I had the venison, which had so much potential, but was served on a bed of french fries. My wife had the scallops, which themselves were good, but the accompaniment was confusing - there was no correlation between the feature and the rest.  Overall, extremely overpriced for the quality of the food. The chef should be ashamed of some of the dishes they&apos;re putting out. The service is excellent and you will certainly enjoy the atmosphere. The sauces are good, but the dishes should be able to stand on their own.</body>

        <body>My husband has Celiac disease and other food restrictions.  They did a great job listening to his needs, suggesting options (they even have a gluten free menu), and checking with him whenever they had questions/needed to alter what he was getting.  The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious.  When we made the reservation, there were tons of openings.  However, when we got there, there was a long wait and we were able to bypass it since we had made reservations.</body>

        <body>Traveled to Indy for a business trip.  Had a late night dinner with cohort.  The waitress was fantastic in ensuring all of our needs were met.  She knew the menu well and described food and drink to perfection.  Her personality was great!  The food was good and cooked as requested.  The flavor was awesome!  Loved the place, the food, and especially the service!</body>

        <body>Unfortunately the service was not excellent. The hostess who sat us at our table was quite rude. The table next to us had the back of one of their chairs at our table and asked if she could pull the table away to give us more room and she told me we could wait for another table that&apos;s ours that&apos;s the way it is.  Our server was very slow with every course. And we waited for our check a long period of time. Yes they were busy; but I&apos;ve been to this location before when it was equally busy and it was a better experience.</body>

        <body>While the food was very good in both quality, timeliness and taste, my family and I found nothing overly special about the experience. In fact, at the end of the meal my wife said, &quot;we could have gone to Texas Roadhouse and gotten pretty much the same food for less money and with better service. Please understand, our server was adequate but not friendly, didn&apos;t even appear to try and anticipate our needs (for example we ran out of rolls in the first 5 minutes and were never even asked if we wanted more. We would have gotten another basket even if we had to pay. And any other staff, including the greeters and any other staff we passed in the aisles, etc.. were all very terse. No one greeted me as I arrived (I parked the car after dropping the family off). I had to walk the dining room and find my family and as I did, not a single staff member so much as smiled at me. Again, nothing was bad per se, it just wasn&apos;t good. Nothing in the entire experience made me &quot;have to come back.</body>

        <body>We are never disappointed when we dine at Weber Grill.  We have made reservations a few times and are always seated in a timely matter!  We also enjoy dining in the bar without reservations and have had great service no matter which approach we plan.</body>

        <body>Went to Weber Grill to celebrate a birthday.  Turned out to be &quot;one to remember&quot; - because the dinner was awful.  None of the food was even hot.  &quot;Beef Brisket&quot; would have been more aptly named &quot;Fat and Gristle Brisket&quot; - totally inedible.  &quot;Devour Downtown Special&quot; was practically the same price the dinner would have cost any other day, and we left there still hungry.  Will likely never go back to this restaurant..extremely disappointing.</body>

        <body>We had a wonderful dining experience at Weber Grill.  It was just the two of us and we enjoyed a nice appetizer to share, beer and a wine from the wine list along with our meals. Loved the pretzel bread that is served with dinner. I loved how they allowed you to purchase half a bottle of wine, which made it quite affordable. All food was wonderful. Our server was good but seemed tired as we caught her the week after the NCAA finals and I&apos;m sure they were slammed that week. Overall, great food, great experience, we WILL be back!</body>

        <body>Good service. Very helpful waiter made suggestions and I liked everything I ordered.  Fixed green bean side to order.  I can recommend beer can chicken, mac &amp; cheese, brisket and meatloaf.  All good with a good barbeque sauce on the side - flavorful and mild, not sweet or vinegary.</body>

        <body>Was in town with family for Final Four.  Made reservations.  Seated quickly. Elmer our server was excellent.  Explained everything very well, very detailed on taking orders with options and cooking preferences.  Food was excellent, great flavor and done as requested.  Only miss was one steak order was a little tougher than expected.  Smoked pork chop was outstanding - everyone at table took a bite and was impressed!</body>

        <body>The service was very slow (we received one refill w/in an 1.5 hr time frame) and the food was less the then par. My wife’s hamburger was under cooked and my steak (peppercorn steak) was about 30% fat. Very disappointed in the food.</body>

        <body>Make reservations because this place is always packed and for good reason. The food is awesome and the service is very good. Definitely try the BBQ combo, it is well worth it and the beef brisket will melt in your mouth.</body>

        <body>The waitress that we had was wonderful. She made sure that we were happy with our selections. The only complaint I would say was that it was very noisy. Our party had a hard time hearing one another due to other guest in the room. But we still thought the food was great and the place was wonderful. It will be on our list to come back and dine again.</body>

        <body>We lucked into an awesome slot for an early New Year&apos;s Eve dinner! It was crowded, however, we got there well before our reservation time and were seated right away.  The food was fast and our Fillet was cooked to perfection.  Our server Andres was AMAZING!!!! We were surrounded by a busy, but not too noisy atmosphere.  We had a wonderful romantic dinner.</body>

        <body>3 of us ate there before a mid-week theatre performance. Each of us had something different, and we all enjoyed our choices. Onion curls to start with, then 1 Steak Salad entree, 1 grilled Salmon on plank, and 1 combo of pulled pork &amp; ribs. Plus the beets/walnuts/feta cheese to share - and we were all full! Tasty!</body>

        <body>Weber Grill is a nicely appointed restaurant with a high end feel. Service is usually very nice. Reservations are advised, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, or if there is a special event in town, the wait can be over an hour. We have always found the food to be very good and many dishes have a slightly different flair due to the grilled flavor. My husband enjoys the steaks and finds them up to par with the better steakhouses, at a slightly more reasonable price. His favorite steak had a price increase since our last visit, up to $32, but still well worth it . I usually enjoy the &quot;comfort food&quot; and opt for a barbecue combo with my favorite meatloaf and either ribs, brisket or chicken. On this last visit I found that although the price did not increase from $18.50, the portion size seems to have shrunk. Although delicious, one not very thick slice of meatloaf and 3 tiny babybacks, did not seem worth the price. On previous occasions 2 slices of meatloaf were served with a more g</body>

        <body>The waitress swore that what I ordered wasn&apos;t on the menu although I have ordered the same thing at least seven times. She came back and let me know that the chef didn&apos;t know what I was talking about and rolled her eyes and said they only use FROZEN chicken. Yuck. The food was good but she was so darn rude. To the waitress: you unfortunately do not know who you are serving and you shouldn&apos;t be rude to a table because they are young or because the order burgers for dinner. That will certainly leave a BAD taste in my mouth!! Certainly the worst server we have ever had there.</body>

        <body>We had dined at the Weber Grill for Thanksgiving 2012.  It was fun and the food/service was great.  My husband &amp; brother ordered from the main menu, the brisket.  It was AWESOME.  We have been talking about it ever since.  During Devour Downtown 2015, we really wanted to go back and get some more of that great brisket.  We brought along our two friends, bragging the whole time about how tasty, tender and delicious the brisket was.   Well, not this time.  I am not even certain the first serving of brisket was really brisket.  It looked pale and we had to saw through it with a knife.  You had to chew forever to get it to the point of swallowing.  So, we brought it to the attention of our waitress.  She offered to bring us all new plates of food.  Well, everything else was fine.  The meatloaf was fine, the steak was fine, the pulled pork was fine &amp; the side dishes were all fine.  But everybody&apos;s brisket sucked!  We just wanted to fantastic brisket.  We tried to tell the waitress that, bu</body>

        <body>I had made a reservation and they were a little slow at first, BUT the server ( I wish i remember his name- i think it started with a J) made the experience personable by using my name as much as possible.  I work in hospitality and tourism and this is a terrific way to wow a guest.  He was on top of everything!  And then when the food came, not only was it done so in a timely manner but it was the best brisket i had ever tried.  The steak was cooked to perfection and the overall atmosphere made us feel welcome and ready to make a second reservation!</body>

        <body>We were seated at the worst table in the entire restaurant. Next to the exit to the mall. Those boot he&apos;s should be converted to more bar space or closed off. Constant traffic in and out and people looking in through door. Abby, our server was excellent, food was excellent. But next time we visit will make a point to request nowhere near that door</body>

We were both in heaven over every juicy, tender bite.  The wine suggestion by our server was a perfect pairing.  The vegetables were just OK.  Not amazing except for the potatoes.  The mini desserts weren&apos;t fresh and the chocolate chip cookies were hard and stale.  We would come back again but make different choices on the latter.  Our waiter was perfectly attentive and on top of everything.  He made our evening very special.</body>

        <body>Took my wife there before we went to the symphony and we both enjoyed the great tasting steaks. Server was attentive and the atmosphere was nice and friendly. Glad we made reservations as the wait line when we left at 7pm was over 1.5 hours. We got right in at 5:30 in time to enjoy diner and make the show down the street with time to spare.</body>

        <body>the steaks where dry and the sides where cold. After tell the waiter of the great disappoint of our meal, the manager offers us a $15 girt card for our next visit even though we told him we were from out of town and wouldn&apos;t be able to use them even if we had wanted to. No offer to take anything off the bill or a free desert?!?!?! Do not waste your time or money on this one.</body>

        <body>We made reservations and they were ready for us when we arrived.  However, there is a nice bar area that looked like a great place to sit and wait for a table.  Our server went over the specials and was attentive, but not overbearing.  The Prime Rib I had was delicious and the other person I went with had the barbeque ribs and meatloaf and really liked them both.  We didn&apos;t do desert, but they had a lot of delicious choices.</body>

        <body>Meet another couple here during devour downtown.  They ordered off the normal menu and my wife and I select something off the devour menu to sample.  Wife had the steak and I ordered the pork chops [which happens to be a normal menu item].  My pork chops where delicious.  Wife enjoyed her steak and the drinks where reasonably priced.  The waiter did an excellent job and I look forward to going back!</body>

        <body>Came here the night of the NCAA championship game and the place was packed! We had a reservation and were taken right on time! Service was very goiod and dinner moved quickly. Drinks were a little weak,  but food was solid. Very kid friendly, lots of choices  on the kids menu too. My son loved the ribs! We would return!</body>

        <body>You could smell the hint of charcoal in the air without it being smoky. Just enough to know they really cooked on charcoal grills which was great. Great, fun atmosphere and they were very busy with the Final Four in town. Our waitress, Hannah, was outstanding even though the table next to us were extremely rude to her. My wife and I had the classic burger and the farm burger (on a budget) and they were fantastic. Each had an alcoholic beverage, burgers (each nearly a half pound and one of them a lamb burger), and dessert (the s&apos;more chocolate cake that was very good and extremely fun) for around $45 so in my opinion very reasonable. All in all a great experience</body>

        <body>First Impression are truly very lasting and ours was disappointing. While the staff was friendly, accommodating and apologetic the our first visit may be the last. It seem to start with and incorrect beer that was delivered to our table. Then the news that the kitchen was out of brisket.(very disappointing) While waiting for our dinner to be delivered the waitress brought us warm, wet towels associated with the the end of the meal. Once the meal did arrive the medium rare burger my son ordered was well done. While waiting for the burger to be remade an additional order of very good garlic smashed potatoes showed up. The waitress said &quot;oh, you already have some, sorry.&quot; The host or manager delivered the remade burger and it was cooked perfectly. My wife&apos;s steak was good, my ribs were burned and the meatloaf was pretty dry.</body>

        <body>We had placed a reservation the night before and got to our table pretty quick which was nice. Our waiter kept calling me bud and would talk so fast I couldn&apos;t understand him sometimes. We had to keep asking for rolls, and it took them awhile to get our food to us. I ordered the Delmonico steak and my wife ordered the Salmon. We both weren&apos;t impressed with our meals as we felt they lacked flavor. I personally feel that if I am paying $35 for a steak it shouldn&apos;t need steak sauce. We will probably go again because we do enjoy the place, but will be a little more selective on what we order to eat.</body>

        <body>Maybe it was because we did the Devour Downtown, but the steak was a very cheap piece of meat.  Service was lousy, starting with our request for drinks upon sitting down, that failed to show until the main course was served.  Even for Devour Downtown the entire meal was overpriced.  Will never go back.  So many other good steak places in Indy, stay away from this one.</body>

        <body>Our grown children hosted a birthday party for my husband at Weber Grill.  It was  first time visit for us and we could not have been more pleased.  Though the restaurant was packed to the brim, we were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation time.  The host was friendly, cheerful, and gave us the full history of the restaurant.  The menu has many wonderful options and our server offered helpful advice and recommendations to aid us in our selections.  Our dishes were delivered timely with a lovely, understated presentation.  The food was absolutely delicious - steaks prepared exactly as ordered, savory, and quite reasonably priced.  The red win sangria was to die for.   Thank you for a truly enjoyable dining experience.  We will return!</body>

        <body>I thought the BBQ sides were terrific.  The salad was just average.  I only tasted blue cheese in one bite of salad.  It was very bland.  The brisket was extremely good and tender.  However, the ribs were dry and the sausage wasn&apos;t very tasty.</body>

        <body>We like the Webber Grill restaurant and try to go when we can.  On a road trip vacation that took us through Indy, we couldn&apos;t miss the opportunity.  The restaurant is downtown with parking close (garage &amp; street).  Restaurant has a great atmosphere, just like other locations we&apos;ve been to.  Food was good as usual.  I like BBQ, so the ribs or chicken are great.  My wife and young kids have great choices as well (if they don&apos;t want BBQ).</body>

        <body>We had a nice roomy table in the bar with a great view of several tv&apos;s - we are sports fans so we wanted to see the games that were on. Our server was very friendly and gave us quick service - I am always impressed when I don&apos;t have to task for a drink refill. The pretzel rolls were fantastic and were complimentary, which is nice when you are spending a decent amount of money on a meal. The amount of food we got with our meals was far more than we could eat. I highly recommend &quot;The Farm&quot; Burger. We will definitely go back and plan to take family when they are visit from out of town.</body>

        <body>Restaurant was so noisy the waiter could not hear the order and messed it up.  I would suggest the waiter repeat the order back to the customer to make sure nothing was missed.  Appetizer came out with dinner because waiter first said he did not turn it in then said he did not hear the order correctly.</body>

        <body>The only positive part of our experience at Weber Grill was that we didn&apos;t have a  long wait to be seated and that was because we had made reservations well in advance. I chose Weber Grill to dine at for Valentine&apos;s Day because i received an email which included a special menu for that occasion.  When we were seated we were given regular menus.  There was no mention of the special menu whatsoever!  The food was not very good.  My fianece requested his steak to be prepared medium well.  The more he ate, the pinker it became.  Finally I asked a waiter if it could be re-cooked. It took FOREVER.  My greenbeans were DELICIOUS; the pretzel rolls were very good, but my salmon was bland.  Overall, it did not make for a Happy Valentine&apos;s Day dinner - our first one together, no less.</body>

        <body>Nice  place. Service was good ,the Staff seemed like they wanted to be there, Very disappointed in the Black Angus meatloaf,it lacked flavor and seasoning,almost like it was artificial,I&apos;ve had better. but the soups and rolls are one of a kind!</body>

        <body>To start I booked my reservation two weeks ahead of time and still had to wait 30 mins for my table when me and my girlfriend showed up. Then we try to order our food and they told my girlfriend  that they were out of what she wanted, we also hear them tell that to a few other which was upsetting. Then I had order a strawberry lemonade as my main drink and my food came before and when I asked the waiter where my drink was he said he forgot and would go grab it which is terrible service. I thought  this would be a good place to take her for valentine&apos;s day but it was a huge mistake and I will  probably never go again cause the service was terrible  and the food was mediocre.</body>

        <body>We sah the Weber signalisiert at the Outside and thought this was a good opportunity to See how grilling is done in America. Back in Germany we can only guess how its done by reading the books. And we were really impressed with the taste of our food. Nothing to complain about. I had the Black Angus Meatloaf and it was delicious. The Only thing we couldn&apos;t be satisfyed about was the taste of chlorine of the drinks with ice. Order your drinks without ice and it will be a Vers good dining experience.</body>

        <body>probably because of it being a Sunday reservation on Valentine&apos;s weekend, there were many items on the menu that were not available for purchase. they were out of beer can chicken, which is my favorite meal. they were out of crab cakes, which was what my wife wanted to order. they were out of lobster tails also.</body>

        <body>Weber Grill is a great place that suits all food levels, from a simple wood grilled pizza, to a huge dry aged steak. The bar selections are wonderful, and the waiters are certain your glass never runs dry. Even when crowded the wait staff still gives individual attention and makes you feel like you are the only one in town! PRIME EXAMPLE - my hubby was in town for the NCAA Final Four and went to Weber on Saturday evening before the game. He ordered a steak with double asparagus - nothing crazy. On Monday evening I came into town and this time I joined my hubby at Weber. We had the same wait staff that my hubby had on Saturday. My hubby told the waiter he was there on Saturday night. They discussed the crowds and then we placed our order. I ordered then my hubby went to order -- that is when the waiter asked him, &quot; Would you like the New York Strip from the founders menus medium rare, with the double asparagus?&quot; Wow! Matt was amazing in remembering an out of town guest meal from two da</body>

        <body>First, I appreciate the staff &amp; management for working on Christmas Eve in providing pleasure to others.  Very thankful to have this quality of meal on Christmas Eve.  Excellent atmosphere and great food.  The Onion Soup was a good choice to start with as it set the tone for the rest of the meal.  The portion sizes are very good with many in our party needing a &quot;to-go&quot; box.  The Brisket &amp; meatloaf are my favorites, however several had the Strip &amp; Rib-eye with glowing remarks.  Overall, very pleased with the meal and service.</body>

        <body>We live in the metro area and have enjoyed the Friday of Final Four weekend on several occasions, The difficultly in years past came when we could not find a dinner restaurant with less than a 1-2 hour wait. I made this reservations 6 weeks ago. Originally the reservation was for 6 then changed to 7, then changed to 9 and the morning of changed to 11. The reservation was &quot;on time&quot; and the entire group enjoyed their dinner. I love the weber grill! We will definitely return!</body>

        <body>The Weber Grill website advertised the Valentines Day menu, to start on February 13th.  I had been looking forward to their shrimp bisque for 364 days, since last year.  I arrived with 6 other people from my office and was informed that the shrimp bisque would not be available until the dinner hour.  I feel like it should have been ready for the lunch crowd, especially since Valentines Day was a non-work day.  I did get the shrimp bisque the next day and was disappointed.  At least I won&apos;t spend the next 362 days looking forward to that dish.</body>

        <body>We planned our anniversary dinner for the Weber Grill.  We enjoy the food, service and the great people that work there.  The manager came to our table after they gave us the Sticky Toffee Pudding as a free desert.  He was very professional, that is whey we keep going back there.</body>

        <body>We had a party of 4, all first time diners at this restaurant. We had a short wait before our table was ready, so we went into the bar and ordered drinks. Our table was ready before the drinks arrived. In fact, it took quite a while to get the drinks after we were seated. Two of us ordered steaks, one ordered prime rib and the fourth ordered a barbeque combination plate. The barbeque combination was a comparatively small portion compared with the other meals. The steaks were generally very good with good charcoal flavor as expected. The prime rib was ordered medium rare, was more like medium. The garlic mashed potatoes were good but the roasted asparagus was improperly trimmed. The ends were woody. The restaurant did have a decent selection of craft beers on tap.</body>

        <body>Really good food, great service/ambience.  Would highly recommend.  Most of the food comes across with a smoky/grilled flavor like you would expect from your own backyard grill.  A lot of how you feel about this sort of flavor will determine how you feel about the overall experience.</body>

        <body>Thought the food was good, but we got stuck in a table for 6 was in cramped and in the isle of 2 sides.  I had a knife dropped on me by a waiter cleaning up a table behind me. And I was bumped  numerous times by waiters and other people in trying to get passed.  This table should have never been there in the first place.  It was uncomfortable for several of us at our table.  We made reservations, and should have been seated in a much better area.</body>

        <body>I had a fabulous ribeye steak and my wife really enjoyed the BBQ ribs. However, service was at best mediocre as server would stop by, notice the water glass, promise to go get some water and then not return. Also, said they were running short on butter for the pretzel rolls (how does a restaurant of this quality run short on butter, it was 5:00pm)?</body>

        <body>We had a party of four and were sat next to a group of 12 and then two more tables on each side of us were sat. Service was slow at first and it was cramped. Food was okay, we&apos;ve eaten here before and had better quality. Prob would go back but sit in the bar area. Didn&apos;t enjoy the family section as much. Little tip to the restaurant, when u sit a big party like that, u may want to move the other tables of four and make them tables of two or eight. That way your not cramped.</body>

        <body>Some of the food items were good, however the some completely lacked flavor. I love bbq but most of there meats were not very well seasoned at all. Side were also bland with exception of baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes. Kids menu chicken tenders were awful and rubbery. Artichok and spinach dip was bland. Not sure my family will be coming back. Great service and atmosphere though!</body>

        <body>Whenever we go to Indy, we like to come to Weber Grill.  It&apos;s always good, and we always have had very good service.  Our waitress was Barbie, and she was very friendly and helpful.  Great job!  The pretzel rolls are the best....just don&apos;t fill up on them before dinner comes.  Good helpings of food, and the ribs were terrific on this visit!</body>

        <body>Menu said for the surf and turf that you get 7oz steak and lobster tail. Received steak and shrimp. Asked about it and server said the menu was old and they missed a few when updating it. Corrected the situation and gave me a lobster tail. Maybe this place shouldn&apos;t so lobster tail because the way they prepare it makes it extremely tough and almost not even fit to eat. They have almost like a stock seasoning that I found to be on almost everything and it&apos;s not a good flavor even. Potatoes had more peelings that really anything. We did have an excellent champagne. Expensive but good. Not a lot of salad options  especially for dressing. Not really a fan of restaurants that do only 1 or 2 dressings and they taste nothing like the average. Sometimes simple is best in dressing. Had classic meal entrees but not really any classic sides which is ok for some. Saw they had crab cakes on the appetizer menu and thought we would try it and it ended up being only a single crab cake and it was most</body>

        <body>We always enjoy the food at Weber, but the service this time wasn&apos;t the best. The waitress we had did ok, but there were things that would have made the experience much better. For example, the wait for drink refills was far to long, we ordered desert for our kids and she brought the huge spoons. On this one we ended up having to ask another waiter to bring smaller spoons for them which he did very quickly. She wasn&apos;t unfriendly, but she also wasn&apos;t super friendly.</body>

        <body>We drove from Louisville to Indianapolis for a concert.  We made reservations for 4 at Weber&apos;s Grill.  We were not disappointed.  We were seated promptly.  The noise level was moderate so we were able to carry on a conversation.   I ordered the barbecue chicken dinner.  It was very good.  My husband had the Mahi mahi and was pleased.   Our friends also had barbecue chicken and ribs.   The evening went great and we were able to easily make the concert.  This was our second visit to Weber&apos;s.</body>

        <body>Food was cold. Mac n cheese was dry. Only thing I had that was good was BBQ chicken. We are family of 5. Son had a burger.  Said it was great. Everyone was not happy. Spend that kind of money. Very dissatisfied.</body>

        <body>I understand that it was Valentine&apos;s Day weekend but we had reservations and still had to wait 20 minutes for our table on Saturday. The food was very good but I was surprised that my $38 steak dinner didn&apos;t come with a vegetable. Just steak and a huge mound of mashed potatoes. I wasn&apos;t impressed. If I eat there again, I will choose a salad or sandwich instead. Our server also did not mention a desert menu or an appetizer so it seemed like we were in a rush.</body>

        <body>Disappointing food qulaity - two of our party steaks arrived so cold that the butter topping had already set up.  Other diners were also having food temperature issues with their steaks also being delivered to the table cold, but cooked correctly.  Obviously some kitchen issues in coordinating the table order so that all food arrives piping hot.   They made it right by re-cwooking the steaks and taking off the bill, but those with us already had eaten and so our meal felt rushed and not relaxing.  This is the first disappointing meal I have had here, so hope they fix whatever this kitchen issue is soon</body>

        <body>Dinner after Christmas Eve church service in downtown Indianapolis.  Great atmosphere, excellent food and super, attentive service!  John was our server.  Terrific baked french onion soup.  I order it every time I&apos;m there.  The grilled scallops special that night was wonderful!  And don&apos;t forget the signatue warm pretzel rolls.  Oh, and the bartender knew what he was doing, too....generous portions!</body>

        <body>Made reservation for 6:30 and was seated on time. Ordered our food and it was prepared in a reasonable time. I ordered the Bbq and pulled pork combo with asparagus and cole slaw. My asparagus was cold as was my corn bread. I  will go somewhere else when in Indy next time. The service was great however.</body>

        <body>This was probably my third or fourth visit. It&apos;s never over the top impressive. It seems to be a bit over priced for the quality of food. Service from the young staff is equal to that of rock bottom or scotty&apos;s bar staff. Desserts here are disappointing. Portion size is level = teaser! Just enough to make you want DQ on the way home. Overall descent place to eat out and would be nice for date night or business meeting.</body>

        <body>Took my wife to dinner here for Valentine&apos;s Day and was not disappointed.  The food was excellent, the staff was knowledgeable and friendly and the service was top-notch.  I would heartily recommend anyone searching for a place to eat to try Weber Grill.</body>

        <body>We were in town for a conference near the airport and  took a cab for a 30 minute drive to this restaurant to experience their tasting menu. It was worth the trip!!! I was a most memorable gastronomical experience. I very rarely give 5 stars in everything. Only exceptional restaurants who impress me as a foodie by taking me to extreme culinary experiences get this high rating. Top congratulations to their executive chef Mathew Weinstein for a terrific evening. We had the 5 Course Tasting menu with wine pairings. Perfect pairings made the entire experience even more memorable. We tasted: Hamachi Crudo, Scallop, Pork Belly, Lamb, and much more, Everything was prepared in the most meticulous and incredible way. Each bite was a total pleasure. We took our time to enjoy our dishes and appreciate the wonderful flavors. This restaurant is now on my must visit list each time I return to Atlanta.</body>

        <body>We looked forward to a nice meal with friends but were disappointed with the overall experience. We aloted two hours for our meal, which clearly was not enough time considering the first course took over an hour to get. The six minute eggs turned out to be 10 minute eggs, which were way over cooked. The main course came out as we finally reached the end of our rope. We ended up having to have the meals boxed up to eat later that night at home.  This place passed its prime. It&apos;s time to move on to one of the hundred awesome restraruants in Atlanta.</body>

        <body>the Chef&apos;s tasting menu with wine pairings is fantastic! Some of the meats were really too rare for me. Presentation and service are very good. We had a new waiter and he was a bit off on the timing of wine and food arriving together. All of the wines were great and I hope I can find them on the open market. Just a side note - the room was cold all around our legs. Don&apos;t know why as there were no doors near.</body>

        <body>greater experience than expected. Get the $90 tasting menu !  All at the table must get it.  I am from out of town, took two customers and they chose the full tasting menu.  I would never get anything else after that experience. The only comparison is French Laundry that I have ever experienced.  It was as close to that as I have experienced...  Great job by the chefs &amp; very professional staff!</body>

        <body>We are gourmet cooks and Woodfire always amazes with combinations that are superb.  The fois gras, wagu beef, pork belly, red snapper, trout and hazelnut roulade were out of this worl as was the wine pairings.  Great atmosphere, THE best restaurant in Atlanta!</body>

        <body>We greatly enjoyed the five course tasting at a Woodfire Grill- between the three of us we had several annoying dietary restrictions (one person with both gluten and dairy intolerance and one pescaterian) and they handled our needs with grace. Everything we ate was tremendous.</body>

        <body>The menu was inspired. Care and attention paid to the dietary restrictions of one member of our group (as well as the preferences of the others) immediately set the tone for a wonderful meal and evening. The service and staff were commendable. Would recommend Woodfire Grill without hesitation.</body>

        <body>Thoroughly enjoyed it even though we were rushing out for our show at the Fox Theater. Everyone accommodated us beautifully so we could get out on time! Thank You!!  Woodfire Grill is our go to restaurant for special occasions and we always order the fabulous prix fixe meals. This time though we didn&apos;t have enough time for that and just ordered a la carte. The food exceeded our expectations and we are now going to make Woodfire Grill our place to eat before we go to Fox theater shows. We are patrons at the Fox so I&apos;m happy to say that you will be seeing us more than the 2 or 3 times a year. Yeah!! Thank you for delicious food and outstanding service. Aimee</body>

        <body>Ironically, I picked this restaurant after looking at the menu online.  The offerings seemed to be varied and of a sort that would appeal to me and my wife.  Since they change the menu every day (a good thing, I think) we hit them on a night when the selection was not as much to our taste (our bad luck).  The waitress explained their philosophy of good, fresh food, interestingly prepared.  We ordered from among the few items that appealed to us.  The waitress appeared to be well schooled in the ability to avoid eye contact, and the result was slower service than necessary.  And when my wife&apos;s &quot;medium&quot; steak appeared in very rare form, we could not get the wait staff&apos;s attention at all.  Finally she walked up to a group of service people who were just standing around chatting, and presented her plate to them.  After that, the entire staff fawned all over us.  I would have been much better had they simply provided reasonable attention when the need existed.  Our main dissatisfaction was</body>

        <body>We used to come here often when Kevin Gillespie was the chef, (and you couldn&apos;t get a table). Things have calmed down a bit, so it was easy to get in. They have a new chef now, and we had a great meal.   If they have a pork belly appetizer on the menu, do yourself a favor and order it. It came with a &quot;scotch&quot; type egg with a perfect center, and the pork belly was cooked down so well, it was the best thing I&apos;ve put in my mouth in months. It was better than the meal, frankly. I want to go back just to have this appetizer.  Some in my table had the trout and the other half had the chicken entree. Both were good, but the kitchen had bad timing and the chicken came out a little cooler than ideal. Our only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars versus 5.</body>

        <body>We were treated like VIPs the moment we entered. In fact, we had reservations for the Atlanta Opera and told them we really needed to leave at a specific time and the entire staff from the host, to the server to the manager knew that we had to leave at a certain time. They prepared our meals quickly without cutting corners on quality or taste. The food was amazing! The restaurant looks small from the outside but once you enter you can see how expansive it really is. Thank you for making my wife&apos;s birthday dinner a success!</body>

        <body>The appetizers were great - scallops, cauliflower soup and gem salad. We ordered the off-bone NY Strip and two trout dishes. Strip was amazing. The trout was bland - no flavor. A huge disappointment. The server even recommended the snapper over the trout and I didn&apos;t pick up the hint.  It was uncharacteristic of Woodfire. I&apos;m going to chalk it up as a misfire and not order it again. Overall, the place is great.</body>

        <body>My wife and I have eaten many times at Woodfire Grill many times since Michael Tuohy brought farm-to-table to Atlanta a decade ago.  Based on our meal there Saturday night, it is now as good as it&apos;s ever been, and maybe better.  As part of our five-course vegetarian and pescatarian dinners, the squash soup was a melange of seductive flavors, an experience we kept talking about after we finished.  The two fish dishes were cooked to perfection.  We got to sample a very wide variety of vegetables and mushrooms, all exceeding expectations.  The space is fine, but not the greatest in the world.  But the wait staff and the wine program all do their homework and make the experience a night to remember.</body>

        <body>Totally not worth the &quot;hype&quot;. Entire 5 course meal lacked depth and flavor. There was no ambiance what so ever, and we hardly ever saw our server. Had she actually visited our table every once in a while, maybe she could  have increased our check amount by providing me with the drinks that I desired. We won&apos;t be back :(</body>

        <body>We opted for the chefs tasting 5 course meal. For the two of us, we spent over $200 including tip. All the courses were good, but none were exceptional, especially considering the expense. Next time we will definitely order a la carte.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to a lot of great places in Atlanta but this place sits far above the rest.  For starters we had the bartenders choice, I had &quot;brown&quot; a pecan espresso old fashion and she had the &quot;white&quot; an Aviator.  Both were excellent. We decided on the 5 course chefs choice, since we couldn&apos;t decide on any one thing from the menu because it all sounded great.  We weren&apos;t disappointed every course was outstanding from presentation to timing to wine pairing and of course taste.  I still can&apos;t decide which course was the best. The Staff was excellent and our waitress friendly and very knowledgeable. We can&apos;t wait to go back and try the 7 course dinner next!</body>

        <body>My husband &amp; I celebrated the anniversary of our engagement at Woodfire Grill.  I am vegetarian;  he is not.  We both had amazing meals.  We were not hurried, but allowed to enjoy each course –  also each other&apos;s company – at a beautiful leisurely pace.  Celebrating any event is a joy at Woodfire Grill.</body>

        <body>The Sunday brunch was fabulous and worth every penny of the price - free-flowing brunch drinks arrived without asking, and it was such fun to try so many things - a friend and I shared a bite of each dish so we were able to sample more - the food is eclectic fusion and it&apos;s very tempting and easy to overdo it as so many offerings are delicious and you want more!  We loved the combination of flavors to make something totally new.  We will be going back again!</body>

        <body>The food and service was great! However, a lot of dishes were brought to the table luke warm. The coffee was even luke warm. But, the food was flavorable. We tried pretty much every dish on the brunch menu and the only one we did not like was the Kimchee Fried Rice. It was terrible and didn&apos;t even remotely taste like Kimchee.</body>

        <body>I have been to Zengo multiple times for brunch and always have a great experience.  Although I was late due to a public transportation delay the hostess was polite and great about seating my party when we arrived.  Our waiter Luis was comical and entertaining, even though he started off quiet.  This was the first time that I had issues wiht my food.  One of the dishes we ordered was undercooked and another was not made as it was in the past.  I ordred a couple to be sure.  Other than that the drinks were great and so was the setting.  I&apos;ll be back!</body>

        <body>What was once a great restaurant, has lost its luster--very disappointing. The experience started with a very confusing call to confirm the Open Table reservation.  The associate stated that the upstairs was no longer open for lunch and actually suggested that I call back to cancel the reservation. I of course called back, and asked if my reservation would still be valid for downstairs. They offered to cancel the reservation again--very odd.  When we did arrive, our waitress was scattered, the food came out in stages (tapas style), was cold, soggy and overall disappointing. Zengo management, what&apos; has happened to you?</body>

        <body>The inventive small plates were excellent, but the real reason I&apos;ll return is this: I cannot TELL you how much we appreciated being able to be seated where we could actually have a conversation, leaving those enjoying the bar happy hour to yell at each other. Excellent pre-theater spot.</body>

        <body>Zengo is a great place for brunch , but sometimes you have to wait 20min for one plate, it&apos;s long ! Our waitress was very busy he couldn&apos;t refill our glasses like we wanted.  But the food is good And the place is very nice so i recommend this place for brunch. Except the wait it&apos;s a great place.</body>

        <body>Zengo is one of my favorites. It&apos;s my go to spot for out of town guests,  birthdays, brunch or just a light bite for the evening. The food flavors are incredibly inventive and very creative. The fustion of latin and asian foods and cultures is a great combination. Add to that the exceptional service and the fun atmospher and you get a perfect dining experience. Luis, our server, was superb. From the time we sat down until the time we paid the check, he was attentive, funny, personable and engaging. He is also great with recommendations for first time visitors as was the case with some of the members of my party. Highly recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>I had an amazing lunch at Zengo again last week. Whenever I go I am very impressed. This was for a business meeting and part of my selection is because you can hear yourself think and speak at Zengo - a definite asset. The best reasons to go, however, are the food and the service. The duck confit &quot;tacos&quot; in a daikon wrap are amazing. The sushi lobster roll was sublime - especially with the special soy sauce. My salmon was a delightful melange of flavors, with the perfect bok choy and brussel sprout accompaniments. My companion loved his chicken and side dishes. His dessert looked amazing. We had perfectly professional pleasant non intrusively attentive service. The excellence of the food and service have been consistent when I visit.  Just have to find reasons to go more often! Zengo is a gem.</body>

        <body>First time diner there - spent time at the bar as our dining companion was running late (the hostess was not fazed at all and just asked us to let her know when we wanted to be seated). Asked the bartender for recommendation for a cocktail - the mango mojito was a perfect suggestion - not too strong, a hint of sweet. Really delicious! At the table, we ordered lychee martinis, also light and refreshing.  My husband and his cousin decided to go with the smaller plates - he had the Zengo chicken salad (good, but not noteworthy) and the pork carnitas rice noodles (light and very good). Cousin ordered the Angry Zengo sushi roll and tuna salad - she enjoyed both (she also loves the crunchy calamari salad).  My husband shared his pork carnitas as the food was too much for him (one dish would not have been enough, 2 were too much). I had the Chipotle Miso Glazed Black Cod on the advice of the waiter - it was absolutely delicious (the fish melted in my mouth), but as a &quot;main dish&quot;, I found it </body>

        <body>Can&apos;t believe I haven&apos;t tried their brunch before, it was truly a great  spot! The ambience was great and the food was yummy. We ordered multiple of the same small plates because they were so good! The bacon fried rice and the arepas were out favorites. The service was also great, food kept coming out right on time and our drinks were always filled up :)   Going again this weekend!</body>

        <body>Second time here and ended up getting the same waiter who helped himself to an extra $3 on the tip from me after my first visit.  Expressed this to the hostess (because we wanted a different server) and she looked like she couldn&apos;t even be bothered with me at all.  Bad customer service and the waiters were all gossiping about me &amp; my friends, all because we expressed concerned about being paired with this guy again.  You think someone would forget something like that?!  Why would I lie?!  I will not be back here....there&apos;s plenty other brunch places in D.C. that have better food and better service!</body>

        <body>This was our first time at zengo. The service was great and the environment was pretty cool, but the food was just ok. I was actually pretty surprised that this restaurant had such high reviews. The tuna wonton tacos were very good, the rest--meh. Considering there are SO many places to eat in DC, we don&apos;t have plan to go back.</body>

There should be a tunnel that goes straight from zengo to the movie theater.  And there should be discounted movie tickets for peeps seeing a film after dinner.  Even though if your at zengo your probably not too strapped for cash it would be nice �</body>

        <body>The food was phenomenal and to have bottomless brunch that included so many different options was beyond amazing. Enjoyed the food, the decor, and the energy of the place. Definitely will be going back not only for brunch, but for other meals as well.</body>

        <body>I like Zengo for lunch because I can actually hear at the restaurant unlike other more popular restaurants in the neighborhood.  However I find the menu odd and I think the portions are very small for the price.  The food is tasty, I&apos;m not saying it isn&apos;t.  But Tadoori chicken with Chinese sides in the bento box?  Odd.   If noise weren&apos;t an issue, I would go somewhere else.  Of course it&apos;s probably quiet in there because they hardly fill half the restaurant at lunch.</body>

        <body>Great, quiet table overlooking the street. Excellent sushi and the black cod was beautiful. My friend had the chicken breast, which was amazingly juicy and flavorful. We shared the chocolate tart for dessert which was non-descript but hey, it&apos;s chocolate!  We&apos;d go back again in a heartbeat.</body>

        <body>Brunched here with a big group and we had a fabulous time. We thoroughly enjoyed the endless food &amp; drink! Service from Michelle was amazing, we never had to ask for anything. She was always on point with the refills and food recommendations!  On the downside, the menu is a little all over the place and there were only a couple dishes that really wow&apos;ed me. Also, something seemed strange with the lighting - kind of orangey? Took some getting used to. The service &amp; overall experience will definitely bring me back to dine here again!</body>

        <body>I have been to Zengo several times for brunch and have been impressed by the food each time. However I don&apos;t normally have a reservation and end up sitting in the downstairs bar area where service can suffer. If you plan to go, I would always recommend a reservation, the difference in service is HUGE! (This isn&apos;t meant to disparage the staff downstairs, they always seem to be under-staffed.)  A vegetarian friend had heard me rave about the food and asked to go to Zengo for her birthday. I checked out the menu and saw a fairly small number of vegetarian options. I attempted to contact the restaurant via their website and received no response - NOT a good sign.  However, our server absolutely awed me with his handling of the vegetarian requirements. He pointed out the handful of veggie options, and as the meal went on he sent out vegetarian versions of normally meaty dishes. When we ordered meat dishes we always received the correct number for our meat eaters, and he even sent out anoth</body>

        <body>My friend and I have been doing our birthday brunch here for years.  We always have such a great time. The servers are always wonderful, too! They make sure our glass is never empty and we always have some delicious food in front of us so we&apos;re never waiting :)  Our server, Justin, was definitely on point, too! He kept us laughing every time he came by the table. We could see it was the same across all of his tables. His friendliness and attention definitely made the experience all the better. This has always been our experience with the service at Zengo&apos;s brunch.  And of course the food is delicious :)</body>

        <body>I recently enjoyed a fun Friday night dinner here. Although, the menu is not very large, I was impressed by the creativity and taste of the vegetarian options. The vegetarian sushi rolls and crispy tofu were absolutely delicious. Probably the best meal I&apos;ve had in DC for a long time. The sakura margarita was also wonderful.</body>

        <body>We heard about Zengo through Thrillist.    This was our first time at a restaurant that served only small plates.  We went ahead and got the unlimited brunch special for $40 with unlimited drinks off a selected menu and all the small plates you can eat.  Definitely bring your appetites!  The food comes out quickly and tastes great!  The restaurant has a cool and modern vibe.  The decor is beautiful.  Servers are very accommodating.  We had a group of 5 girls and each dish was big enough for all 5 of us to share.</body>

The angry zengo roll was one of the many highlights. The plantains were also delicious. Our server was hilarious and catered to our every need.  Well definitely be back.</body>

        <body>I went here with my girlfriend for restaurant week and we couldn&apos;t have been happier with our choice.  The dishes were unique, each bursting with flavor.  We started with the empanadas, the guacamole, and the Angry Zengo roll.  the empanadas were perfect and came with a delicious sauce, and the guacamole was paired perfectly with the spicy crab meat they mixed in.  The roll was the only dish that didn&apos;t stand out.  The flavor was good, but the roll itself was smaller than I was expecting.  For dinner, we had the steak and the salmon.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the sweet potatoes were delicious.  The salmon was outstanding, easily one of the best preparations I have ever tried.  For dessert, we did the coconut tres leches and the churros.  the tres leches was the tasty and the churros were awesome.  They were freshly prepared and came with a tasty dipping sauce.  Overall, it was a great experience.  I would definitely go back.</body>

        <body>The waitstaff at Zengo is extremely attentive! Our drinks were never empty and our table always had food on it. We were there from about 11am - 3pm and got our moneys worth. Some brunch places are stingy with the refills or have time limits but Zengo was all about customer service and the experience.  Would definitely return for brunch!</body>

        <body>Zengo reverberates as a Winner for myself and everyone I introduce it to. I do not think the cod and the crispy tofu can be beaten anywhere in the area.</body>

        <body>Most restaurants will claim to serve fusion cuisine, but mess up the flavors. Not Zengo. We ordered the Pork Arepas and the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. Delicious! I ordered the Chipotle Miso-glazed Black Cod and the explosion of flavors made me very happy: the radishes were the right mix of crispy and the miso-glaze was a perfect complement to its natural flavor. The cod fell off the fork and the chipotle flavors went perfectly with the lightly flavored fish. The dish went around the table and got six thumbs up. We were too full for dessert, but we&apos;ll get some the next time. We also got the pisco sour and Zengo got that right, too. All around - one of our favorite restaurants in DC.</body>

        <body>Sunday night was extremely quiet at Zengo which allowed us to get a window seat. It was entertaining to watch the traffic on 7th Street. The menu has interesting combinations of flavors with an Asian Latin fusion theme. We shared salt and pepper shrimp tacos and chicken empanadas and then each had an order of the Zengo fried rice. It was just the right amount of food and all was very tasty. We were given dessert menus and might have ordered something but the server was so slow to get back to us we decided to just return to our hotel and hope for coffee there.</body>

        <body>We had a delicious dinner at Zengo on a quiet post-holiday Sunday evening.  Although we live nearby, we had not tried this restaurant before and were happy to find that the food and service were very good. Although the corner of 7th and H is usually bustling and loud, the dining room is on the second floor and well insulated from the street noise below.  We shared the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps.  This dish was nicely spiced with enough heat, but without being overwhelming.  Even though it was a small plate, there was enough for two to share as an appetizer.  For our mains we had the scallops and beef short ribs.  Both dishes were delicious.  My dining companion, who usually avoids red meat, kept stealing bites of my short ribs.   We shared the pear empanadas for dessert, which consisted of two sweet, fried empanadas filled with cream and chopped pears.  It was served with caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream  It was plenty for two to share and was a nice ending to the meal. Our serve</body>

        <body>Our waiter was very attentive and good at making spot-on suggestions.  The wine list is very nice.  We loved the chicken empanadas, the salt and pepper shrimp tacos and the short rib entre.  The food is designed to be shared and that is exactly how my family loves to eat - we like to all try each item and compare notes.  We have ordered this way even in restaurants that are not designed to serve the food family style.  It was nice that Zengo was designed for family style dining.</body>

        <body>We go for the fixed price bottomless drinks, not the food and the service is hit or miss.  Its fun to sit upstairs at the window tables. Rudy wasn&apos;t a bad server but we could tell he got irritated when we stopped eating but stayed for the drinks. DON&apos;T go for the food. Its not good. Drinks are overpriced when going outside the bottomless brunch. We have gone a couple of times now but are going to find someplace else to go.</body>

        <body>We went to eat here before the game.  Did not have to wait for our 6pm reservation. There is no valet, so we went down the street to another restaurant to valet for $20. Food came out timely, drinks were good.  Cost was $$$.  Nice place to go for special occasions.</body>

        <body>Early 5pm dinner.  Wait staff pretty busy gossiping with each other.  Servive got better as they got busier.  Octopus hot stone mushroom jalapeño rice very tasty, jusy very low on octopus.  Empanadas an 8.  Other dishes a 7.  Great decor, open plan up and downstairs with nice long bar tables.  Good place to meet up for appetizers and drinks.  Mixed drink menu and quality is best attribute.</body>

        <body>Richard Sandoval has found a way to blend the flavors of Mexico with Asia with interesting and intriguing results.  We were seated  promptly at a round table -a plus for a group of 8. Our server was most helpful as we were somewhat perplexed with the menu. We asked for a sampling of the most popular dishes and were not disappointed- Asian crab tacos, duck enchiladas with daikon chips for an Asian flair.  The short ribs were outstanding as was the steamed fish. We loved all the tastes in the many dishes we sampled-go see for yourself why this is a restaurant starting new food trends in the US.</body>

        <body>As a fan of both latin and asian food, I found this combination unique and delicious. Ceviche with coconut milk was clever and tasty. Thai shrimp with chorizo was an awesome pairing. Pork arepas with hoisin and crema fresca worked well. The margarita was good with fresh lime juice and it was nice to have a Mexican craft beer choice. So many other great fusion combinations to pick from as well. Most plates are small so you can try and share a variety.</body>

        <body>Brunch crowd was energetic, young and loud. Food was very good.  Endless mimosas added to the noise level. Went with two friends to celebrate birthdays. Had gone previously for dinner and enjoyed it very much. Dinner scene significantly different. Enjoyed the non-traditional brunch menu and drinks very much. A good time was had by all and our server, Roberto was great.</body>

        <body>I love Zengo--haven&apos;t been in years, but its as good as ever.  Service, drinks, food are all wonderful.  My only sort-of negative comment is that the lights are a bit too bright on the 2nd floor for dinner.</body>

        <body>This was my first time for boozy brunch here (all you can eat and drink).  The menu had much to offer, and the plates came out in reasonable timing.  Food was great, but not hing super memorable.  Graffiatos does a much better bottomless brunch.</body>

        <body>On Saturday afternoon, a group of my friends got together for Brunch.  Only one of us wanted the Bottomless Brunch option for $39 so we sat at a table downstairs near the bar.  The drinks were very reasonably priced (with mimosas at $5).  My friend and I shared five brunch plates, which was plenty for the two of us.  The lobster grits were very good and filling.  Bottomless Brunch is a good deal if you eat and drink A LOT.  The brunch plates are small.  Some are a much better deal than others. For example, 2 tiny empanadas will cost you $7.  My group is very relaxed and low key.  We are not demanding or super critical at all.  Even when we didn&apos;t get one of our food orders until about 40/45 min. later without apology or explanation... we did not complain.  However, we were shocked by the rude and inappropriate behavior displayed by our waitress.  She mistreated her fellow staff members, mostly ignored our table and spoke very harshly and rudely to everyone in her path without provocat</body>

        <body>Waited an hour for food, &quot;bottomless&quot; drinks= whatever the server had in a pitcher as they walk by. The food runners kept bringing the wrong food to the wrong tables, so I&apos;m not surprised we only got to order 2 rounds of tapas before they kicked us out ( we had a 1 pm brunch reservation... Didn&apos;t think it would take an hour per order). The worst brunch/ restaurant I have ever been to- very disappointed as I was given this recommendation by a friend. Also, the women&apos;s bathroom upstairs was disgusting.</body>

        <body>Zengos was recommended to me through a friend because of my food allergies.  Not only was the food absolutely delicious, but our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable, as were the hosts we met that evening.    I loved it so much I wanted to grab some take-out before I left town; however, when I called a second time (after waiting 10 minutes on hold), I was told they would not be able to take my take-out order for 20 minutes.  Outside of this, Zengos is a wonderful restaurant.</body>

        <body>Chicken empanadas were delish. Waitress was kind enough to point out there was shellfish in the chili paste as garnished.  This is a huge thing for me because I have an allergy to shellfish and it wasn&apos;t listed. Chicken salad was delicious. Beef short rib portion was larger than normal but they didn&apos;t disappoint. My companion eagerly devoured Her scallops. Churros, sorbet, and pear empanadas were great!</body>

        <body>We had dinner at Zengo on the first day of the Chinese New Year.  They had some nice themed specials.   The shrimp tacos off the small plates menu were fabulous.  They also had a nice cocktail list. After dinner we got fortune cookies and inside were coupons for free drinks and food on the next visit.   I would go back again. The downstairs bar was mobbed for $5 drinks and small plates for happy hour.</body>

        <body>If you want to have a decent weekend brunch avoid Zengo. The food was bland, the portions small (even by tapas brunch standards), the drinks rotated between watered down and simply undrinkably bad and the bar area smelled strongly of rotting fruit. The only thing that was impressive was how inattentive the service was. It was the first and only time in my life I have ever had to waive to the waiter to get him to come over and refill my table&apos;s beverages - something I consider incredibly rude, but after waiting for 30+ minutes with an empty glass, became necessary. Several of the dishes were so bad I would have sent them back, had there been any staff on the dining room floor. The brunch was expensive by DC brunch standards, and utterly overpriced based on what we actually got. The most enjoyable part of the experience was the decor (average modernism) and music playlist (good top 40 type mix). That those are the only two &quot;positives&quot; that I can come up with should tell you to go anywhe</body>

My faves (as in I ordered them twice) were the guava mimosas and Thai chicken empanadas. As for service, the staff was quite welcoming.

        <body>Sunday brunch is a fantastic deal.  The small plates style allows for easy sharing of many dishes without having to commit to one larger dish.  I liked that there was a mix of more traditional breakfast food and Asian-inspired dishes.  The drinks were also fantastic, and it&apos;s great that you can try different types of mimosas and bloody Marys, again without having to stick with just one choice.  Service was very good, although dishes took longer as the day went on.  I take that as a positive, though, because this is a place you go to for a long, relaxing brunch and not a quick bite and leave type of meal.  Servers were also very friendly and accommodating.  I&apos;ve been to bottomless brunches where they try to usher you out as quickly as they can, but at Zengo they told us to take our time and order more when we were ready.  They also regularly came by to fill up the drinks (which had a very good alcohol ratio) instead of us having to chase them down for a refill.  Definitely a great expe</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Zengo several times for brunch, and it really is our &quot;go-to&quot; spot to bring out-of-towners or get together with a group of friends.  The drink deal is great because of the various types of juices for mimosas, and I just learned this visit that sangria is included too - wish I knew that a long time ago!  The food is excellent and has never disappointed.  Will definitely return.</body>

        <body>My wife and I went for restaurant week and had an amazing meal. The service was great, we asked for recommendations and all three that we went with were outstanding. It;s pricey, but really good!</body>
