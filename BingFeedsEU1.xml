        <body>have been to this restaurant many times and the service and food is very good, but it is not value for money without the discounts plus the menu is now not as extensive as it used to be so the better things also now have a £3 supplement so all in all I think it will be awhile before I go back because I think they put the prices up so really you are not getting a discount.</body>

        <body>We had 2 courses, starter and main, with wine for 24.95 each, which in the face of it is excellent value. However, the food arrived suspiciously quickly: there was barely time to sip a bit of wine in between starter and main. The service was impersonal and hurried - which there was no need for since the restaurant was not full. We were served by at least three different people. When the main arrived, there was so much food heaped onto the plate that the pasta meal was completely unappetising. We had to abandon the meal and take the wine home. Utterly disappointing.</body>

        <body>Visited on a Friday night on there special pre-theatre menu of 2 courses for £16.50. The service was very prompt and efficient, which when you are trying to squeeze in a quick dinner after work but before getting into a show was exactly what you want. There was an excellent selection on the menu, so much so we really struggled to choose, and when the food arrived it was presented beautifully and tasted amazing. Have been before and will definitely be back.</body>

        <body>This week&apos;s pilgrimage to Cafe des Amis saw me visit the wine bar (the down stairs area) which is evidently frequented by Royal Opera and Ballet performers. When I had lunch there it was filled with some old school looking people who looked like they really enjoyed their wine!  I had the linguine with king prawns, mussels, chilli, garlic and extra virgin olive oil. Darn tasty stuff- simple but really hit the spot - like a bowl of pasta at a local restaurant in Italy. I also enjoyed a couple of glasses of the house wine - high quality stuff for the entry level selection. I started chatting with the bar man Jean Luc who has worked there for 30+ years - he informed me that at the end of March they would be launching a brand new bar food menu (he seemed particularly excited about the Toulouse hot dog, whatever that means!) along with a new wine list! Consider me booked in for next week!</body>

        <body>Went for lunch to Cafe des Aims. First visit. Very pleasant, nice atmosphere, good serving staff. Food was basically French Bistro - but fine for all that. Value for money on the 2/3 course lunch menu was exceptionally good - a wide range of choices on each course and a significant saving on the a la carte menu. Wine prices / choices were reasonable and, given the central location, in some cases better than that. I would lunch there again. 1 point to note - the evening a la carte prices are quite a bit higher than the lunch offers - but the restaurant does have some special offers, so in the evening i would watch out for them</body>

        <body>We came here before the Theatre on a cold and windy Saturday night in London. I was 30 mins early, but our table for 6 was ready, and I was welcomed to sit down and have a drink. The set menu of two courses and 2 glasses of wine was good value, and the wine was very pleasant for the house offering. For starter I had French Onion soup which was nice, though vegetarian I think as the stock didn&apos;t taste very beef like! Main was salmon with potato and veg. Again seasoned well and hearty portions. The place was really busy and really buzzy, and I am glad I have found a new restaurant to add to my pre-theatre list!</body>

        <body>Excellent meal very friendly efficient staff . We had the alacarte menus. The onion soup and Roquefort salad were yummy. We then had moules (enormous portion) and confit of duck both delicious for dessert sorbet and ice cream with a shot of Cointreau and amaretto a perfect finish. Ap water supplied and bottled water not pushed. A bottle of Prosecco (bit  pricey) .used my gourmet card and received 50% of. They also take taste card. But have lots of special deals .</body>

        <body>The staff at cafe des amis were attentive and discreet, charming and nonintrusive, as one would expect, and deserve credit.   The food was however not of the same standard. A nice enough glass of merlot helped but my fishcake was dry and under seasoned. It was accompanied by a glob of mayonnaise which one expect to be homemade in a French restaurant. If it was the chef needs shooting. My friend&apos;s steak was overdone and the frites not of that amazing quality you get in small Parisian bistros. The sauce was packet-like.  Decor and lighting  nice enough with a  pleasant hum of middle-aged diners.</body>

        <body>As on several previous occasions, this restaurant in the heart of Covent Garden provides well-cooked and presented good quality food.  Although the ALC menu is over-priced, with the TT offer is it reasonable value (although the supplements make some of the dishes still on the high side).  The menu is also somewhat too unchanging, making it less interesting for diners who come here on a regular basis.  The service is welcoming and friendly, making it an enjoyable lunch or dinner out. Strongly recommend-with the offer!</body>

        <body>Last time I was dinning at this restaurant was 6 years ago. The you had fresh flowers on every table, bar and even the toilets. The napkins we proper and ambiance and lighting together with music were giving the place charming atmosphere.  Today the place looks like it needs a refresh. the restaurant was really dark, the patio doors had drink stains on them, the flowers were gone and proper napkins replaced with paper ones. The lovely french menu was replaced with standard menu, that to be honest was nothing special. The food was served even though my partner was still in the toilet (a bit inappropriate to serve food when people are not at the table). Food was just warm, not very hot at all. There was no elegant presentation,  the food was slapped on the plate. To be honest really disappointing. Average, food, average service in hear of Covent Garden.</body>

        <body>The manager was REALLY rude. The table we had reserved was NOT kept for us,  the ONE other group in the restaurant (downstairs) was sat at it. The Manager told me I made her feel &apos;uncomfortable&apos; when I stood near her when she was trying to search for the terms and conditions on the computer, she told me I had to sit down! She made up terms and conditions to the offer saying we had to have THREE courses to qualify, these conditions are NOT on the conditions sent to me by Open Table.  She made the whole experience very unpleasant and forced the other people off the table we had reserved causing us untold embarrassment. I&apos;ve been coming here twice yearly for years to meet special friends I rarely see, such a shame she ruined it. The bar man, on the other hand was lovely and he salvaged the unpleasant taste the manager had put in our mouths. PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS</body>

        <body>Service was lacking. My friend ordered the duck for main and could not even eat it. The rest of the food was ok. Not many vegetarian main options, only Ravioli available, which was disappointing for another of my friends. The Tuna was good though and this would be recommended if anyone is thinking of going but be sure to ask for rare as the medium was more well done than the medium requested. We ordered drinks which never arrived and after 40 minutes waiting for wine, we gave up. Paid for the bill and went for dessert and drinks elsewhere. I won&apos;t be returning in a hurry that&apos;s for sure. Only good think was I didn&apos;t pay full price as I had booked through OpenTable.</body>

        <body>We arrived at 17:30 sharp as the Cafe des Amis was filling up to capacity quickly, yet were provided with an efficient and friendly service which made it possible for us to enjoy a three-course meal in under 1h15minutes (two guests). Ordering a la carte was not the lowest cost option but the food was overall very good (even if the restaurant clearly does not offer the best meat in town). The only real disappointment came with the &quot;bordeaux&quot; ordered by the glass and which was slightly corked....</body>

        <body>The special offer made our visit to Cafe Des Amis very good value and we enjoyed our pre dinner drink in the downstairs bar. Overall the food was very tasty, my only complaint was that the food came very quickly which made me wonder how freshly prepared it was and my main course was not very hot. However, the service was good and I would recommend this restaurant if you use the special offers available.</body>

        <body>Meeting up with friends to spend time together mainly to catch up, Café des Amis is an ideal location.  It is both central and relaxed.  We had the three course with a glass of wine option for £28.  The wine glass really was more than half full!  The choices of courses were varied and although not &quot;haute cuisine&quot; were generous and seasonal.  The fishcakes were a bit bland but the fresh salads were appetising.  Service was efficient and we did not feel rushed; when we asked for more time between courses they were fine with that.  Yes, not out of this world but it does not burn a hole in your pocket.</body>

        <body>I came for an afternoon pre theatre meal, the atmosphere was really good for an afternoon it was busy and the staff we&apos;re friendly, polite and attentive.   The food is top form and is completely worth the money they are asking and the fact you can get deals makes it even better.   I shall be returning as i felt very relaxed and comfortable eating here and i shall be advising to all my friends to come as well.</body>

        <body>Being a frequent visitor to the Royal Opera House I&apos;ve always been aware of Cafe des Amis&apos; presence but had never visited it. Wow was I glad to have dined there with my other half! Firstly, fabulous value - 50% off and free bottle of good quality house wine. I enjoyed the French Onion Soup - it was pipping hot and extremely delicious - just what I need on a cold March night! For my main I enjoyed the sea bass and gnocchi - yes a weird combination in theory but Cafe des Amis&apos; treatment of it rendered a really tasty dish. For pudding, I&apos;ve heard so much about the Chocolate Soup from friends - wow - really good - think an extra gooey fondant in a bowl! Oh yeah, the service was super friend, particularly the manager named Ruta!</body>

        <body>I returned to an old favourite after a number of years absence due to living abroad to be told that the deal I had booked online was not valid. Although the staff subsequently relented and honoured their obligations, the exchange left a bad taste in the mouth, not a good sign before a meal! After that the service was very prompt, the food tasty &amp; well presented, especially the tuna steak and roquefort salad. Overall, with the 50% discount that I was grudgingly given, the meal was good value</body>

        <body>We were seated promptly on arrival and our service was both pleasant and professional. Our waitress was most helpful in her recommendations of dishes. Our food arrived within 15 minutes of being ordered and was hot, beautifully cooked and presented. There was a lovely atmosphere to the whole dining experience at Café Des Amis and I will certainly be visiting again</body>

        <body>Booked this for my two sisters and I, changed the time a number of times before the actual booking, Cafe de Amis was extremely accommodating. Service was great, quick and polite staff. Food was great - creme brulee was especially good and house white, easy drinking and complimentary to a variety of food. We chose the 50% of the a la carte and it was very good value for money.</body>

        <body>The Calamari is always average but the main course was good. Last time I came  I had the sea bass; it was NOT good. Your food presentation does not match the standard of your decor. I mean PAPER NAPKINS?? That is just second rate. Your waiter service is good though, you just need a classy chef.</body>

        <body>The meal was adequate/good despite being &quot;A La Carte&quot;.  However the real point of contention was the pricing of the menu shown on the website was considerably cheaper, particularly for mains than the actual one presented at table- Calves s liver £3.50 more, Lamb +£4 more to note just two items that stood out  House wine for the Open Table offer was also different to the wine list too.  Bit cheeky really...recommend to others probably not.</body>

        <body>We went here for a  dinner, which was ideal, informal and unfussy.  The only catch was that to honour the open table deal they insisted we have a pudding, which was a bit cheeky.  The other issue, which is not uncommon, was that the service charge was merely a hidden cost for the food, but they removed it without fuss.</body>

        <body>Food was very nice and good value with 50% off and free bottle of wine.  However, when we have been to Cafe des Amis in the past it has always been quite full and buzzing and we were very surprised to see it was half empty. I can&apos;t fault the food but there did seem to be something missing and we wondered if the restaurant has changed ownership. We had paper napkins rather than linen ones as we had in the past and the restaurant just felt it lacked some atmosphere. Even the bar downstairs was empty and in the past this would be full. Although the meal was very nice I don&apos;t think we will rush back as the restaurant appears to have lost something,  but I can&apos;t put my finger on what this is.</body>

        <body>A second recent visit to this Covent Garden eatery. This time the service was much more efficient and the food as good as the previous occasion. The only downside was a very noisy birthday table not helped by the restaurant not having much in the decor to soak up the sound - so always a noisy experience and that fact needs to be borne in mind if you want an evening not having to shout at your companion.</body>

        <body>My first comment is &apos;don&apos;t&apos; go here if you are drinking wine as no matter what the discount they charge the same prices as Michlin starred restaurants with house wine starting at £30 a pop. Really not on given this an average restaurant at best. The offer is there to hook you in so they can rip you off with the wine. That said if you are not having wine then the offer is fair value. The inside looks very tired.</body>

        <body>Excellent food as usual and good service. We chose the 50% off with free wine offer and although this is a reasonable offer, by not giving the discount on the dessert and including a service charge which is calculated on the total bill before deductions it is not as good as it seems.  Personally, I do not like so called &quot;optional&quot; service charges being added to the bill.</body>

        <body>This was a very last minute booking for a Saturday evening. I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect from a restaurant so close to theaters especially just before 6pm at it&apos;s busiest.  The staff were delightful, friendly and attentive. The food was tasty and there was no compromise due to speed. Every course was delivered quickly but we were not made to feel rushed. The ambiance was relaxed and the seats comfortable and well spaced out.  This was an absolute joy and would really recommend Cafe Des Amis.</body>

        <body>We arrive 5 minutes early and told to use the bar in the basement, and to return at our reservation time.  which we did, we then found several other groups with books after us, being taken to tables!  When we were finally shown to our table it must have been the worst table in the restaurant, it was right where all the staff when to get drinks, so we were always being knocked or being interrupted, also there&apos;s a large mirror which forces you to lean away from the walk, not good for eating, also there&apos;s a column which juts out, so you can only just about move your chair to get in, and the other end, there&apos;s another table, and again, you don&apos;t get enough room to sit down comfortably.  It took along time, before our order was taken ... asked if we wanted bread, I said &quot;Yes&quot;, but none never turned up!  We had 4 people come to take our order, but when we did ask for the dessert menu - it took over 30 minutes before our waitress came back!  I was really really disappointed with Cafe Des Ami</body>

        <body>Too big, so a little thin on atmosphere.. Worked alright as a pre-theatre restaurant, but rather expensive - pre-theatre fixed price menu has surcharges for more interesting dishes and wines seemed very pricey. Food was OK with plentiful starter. Staff were fine.</body>

        <body>An Essen und Trinken (Wein, Kaffespezialitäten) gab es nichts auszusetzen. Alles war genau richtig und entsprach den Erwartungen. Der Service war durchgängig professionell und die Akzeptanz der Karten sowie die Angebote vor Ort entsprachen den Angeboten online. Für dieses durchgängig qualitativ hochwertige Essen und die guten Getränke und den absolut einwandfreien Service darf man dann auch gerne ein wenig mehr nehmen...</body>

        <body>We had three course meal deal with 50% off the first two courses and bottle of house wine included. On this basis the meal was good value but have to say would have been expensive at full price (the house wine was £25 per bottle). Quite busy on Sunday lunchtime with other couples on the same deal.  Good location but restaurant lacks in our view atmosphere. Service was good and attentive throughout.</body>

        <body>Everything went swimmingly, with a good selection of dishes but the offer we had selected online appeared not to apply .  The à la carte offer, pre 5 pm clearly stated  that it included a half bottle of wine which our charming waiter knew nothing about.  It was still good value in a perfect location for the Opera House, but should have been amazing value.</body>

        <body>We went with friends and had been there before and liked it . We were not disappointed and would go again and have already recommended it to other friends visiting London. It&apos;s a lovely restaurant in the heart of theatre land offering all things to everyone. Eat alfresco or inside, the service is excellent and the food very tasty! Go onto their website for a great deal. The wine we chose was very palatable so we had 2 bottles between the 4 of us with our lunch!  We are looking forward to going again soon.</body>

        <body>As always the Cafe des Amis doesn&apos;t disappoint. The two meals plus glass of wine is excellent value for this centrally situated restaurant. Great atmosphere, staff are professional, polite and helpful. There is a good choice on the menu, both starters and mains were delicious - I had the tuna tartare, be sure to ask for bread, followed by the sea bass, the vegetable base was fresh and lovely. My friend enjoyed the calamari and thought the chicken with pappardelle was even better than the last time.</body>

        <body>Excellent food - just right for lunch with a former colleague.  My starter of Scottish Smoked Salmon Rouleaux, Shrimps &amp; Marie Rose was delicious - excellent flavours, light &amp; refreshing, and I really enjoyed my main dish of Pan-Fried Sea Bass, Gnocchi &amp; Bohemian Vegetables - very well balanced.   My friend enjoyed his Calamari starter and Entrecote Steak.  Service was very courteous and not slow.  Well done!</body>

        <body>We booked for the location as we had theatre tickets for a show nearby and knew there was a pre-theatre menu.   The two course menu is only for a starter and main (no choice of having a main and a pudding) and there was a £3 supplement on one or two of the dishes, so it began to feel like not such a great value, especially when a small glass of very ordinary house white was £6.50 and most wines were £8.50 a glass plus.  The starters were actually very good - I had the goat cheese with carmelised apples, my husband the duck salad - and the servings were very generous.  Our mains were a so-so pasta and a not very good burger (tasted more like meatloaf than an actual burger.)  Service was friendly  and ambience was fine but food not as good as places like Cote and rather more expensive.</body>

        <body>This restaurant has, in my experience, been consistently good. The location is extremely convenient for Covent Garden and other nearby theatres, and provides an oasis of calm and civilisation in this sometimes over-crowded area. Both food and service are above average; and there are tables outside, which provide ample people-watching possibilities. On this occasion, two minor problems were instantly and agreeably resolved - which provided yet another incentive to return soon.</body>

        <body>The menu had plenty of choice although we had the pre-theatre menu.  The service was excellent even though it got really busy when all the other opera goers arrived.  I was allowed to leave a suitcase while I went to the opera and although were two woman, we were well catered for.  A glass of prosecco  was included with our dinner which was £18.50 per person. . . excellent place to go.</body>

        <body>Despite being busy this restaurant has zero atmosphere. The staff are over familiar to the point of rudeness and completely disorganised.  The food itself is totally over priced so even with 50% discount you are still paying London prices for very average to poor &apos;French&apos; food... It is also very disconcerting to order your food and have it delivered to your table in less than 5 minutes!  Over all a total disappointment and if it wasn&apos;t based in perpetually busy covent garden &apos;cafe des Amis&apos; should have closed years ago.</body>

        <body>Cafe des  Amis du Vin was a place to go in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Not any more. Visiting earlier this week with a professional friend, it looks  and feels like a 1990s time warp. Scuffed, furniture, peeling paint, an odd smell,  and. very average food. Almost empty  on an early March Monday, despite its fabulous location, the few diners  were nevertheless largely ignored . A great shame.</body>

        <body>We went here for a pre-theatre meal. Service was acceptable but the food was extremely average and came almost immediately  - not a good sign.  The onion soup  was not caramelised, the very basic salads were tasteless with poor ingredients and the squid was just about OK.  The main course pasta dishes were obviously frozen and tasteless, the fishcake was truly awful with  hard tomatoes and a ridiculously excessive lemon garnish and  the lentils with the duck very overcooked. I could not serve this food at home.  I would not recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>Service was very poor to start - we were left without a waiter for a long time - and then when our food was ordered, each dish came within 5 minutes of the previous one. It felt very rushed. As for the food, mine was very bland and the portions were small. Overall I was quite disappointed by cafe des amis.</body>

        <body>We did get a deal and it was great value. The only downside is that when ever i book through Open Table I always get a table near the loos or near the kitchen . . . but it was full when we went on Saturday evening 7am so no ability to move us. The signature dessert is a bowl of melted chocolate with a bit of warn sponge round the side - the way i describe it no one would choose it - but its fab, if you like chocloate. Well worth it - in fact worth going just for it.</body>

        <body>We booked in advanced and dined from pre/post theatre menu.  The restaurant was busy and we were taken to what looked like a &apos;back room&apos; where there was minimal decor and ambience. My husband&apos;s main came out cold - he asked for it to be heated and it came out lukewarm. My seafood linguine had almost no flavour, it was very disappointing. We dined here a year ago and had a much better experience. Standards have fallen significantly and we won&apos;t be returning here anytime soon.</body>

        <body>Good selection of food on the 2 course lunch special - portions were very generous too! I thought the desserts were a bit pricey at £7.95 considering 2 courses was under £15 but they were very scrumptious (I expected £5 for dessert). It was empty when we arrived at 12.30 but was full an hour later and had a good buzz. Service was attentive and good.</body>

        <body>Went for Valentine&apos;s Day as the Valentine&apos;s menu looked good (£55-a-head), so was hoping for a nice meal with good service. Too much to ask?  The look of the restaurant was nice, and initial service fine. The first issue we had was with the wine - it wasn&apos;t cold enough and we weren&apos;t given an ice bucket, so told the waiter and he brought us over a new bottle in a bucket of water with a little bit of ice, which didn&apos;t last long.  The Valentine&apos;s menu included Prosecco each, which never materialised.  Starters were nice and served promptly.  Mains looked good but tasted very average and were certainly not worth the price. Although disappointed, we didn&apos;t complain.  It took half an hour for our plates to be cleared - quite irritating given the place was only 2/3 full. Desserts were not very nice and we barely touched them, and it was 25 minutes before they were cleared. The waiter took two almost full plates without even querying why we didn&apos;t eat them.  We asked for the bill. 20 minutes</body>

        <body>After hearing so much about the bar menu from longtime barman Jean Luc, I had to come back for its launch. Very tasty food - not overly complicated but ideal for a really good, non-pretentious meal. My friend and I shared the Chicken Satay and Duck Spring roll platter - tasty stuff that went well with the bottle of Sancerre we were drinking (great new wine list by the way - wonderful selection that is worth paying a visit for on its own). For my main I enjoyed the Steak and Ale pie - wholesome, hearty dish with flavourful garlic mash and surprisingly good pea purée . My friend had the star of the show - the Chicken Caesar Wrap - I know it is a basic thing but it was beautiful (tasted good too!)! I&apos;m already booked in for next week, and will be chilling here Friday evening..</body>

        <body>The restaurant is very nice and clean and the staff were friendly. It&apos;s definitely an amazing deal. I did the 2 courses and glass of wine for 2 for £29.99. The courses were large and you could have anything on the menu. The food was beautifully presented and well cooked. The wine is a house one, but they were not stingy. It smelt of bleach in the entrance which wasn&apos;t nice!! I think they should put out candles or something! But don&apos;t be put off by this. The whole experience was very pleasant.</body>

        <body>Dined at Cafe des Amis and the food was as delicious and comforting as ever. The new wine list has  some good options, too. The service was a bit rushed, but overall a very enjoyable experience. Will be back soon - have tickets to the Royal Opera!</body>

        <body>We have been to Cafe des Amis on previous occasions and the food was better this time, although there is a tendency to drown the salad with olive oil and almost every starter and main dish was served with olive oil and pesto dressing. Friendly staff. There were so many different offers that they were confusing. We did not realise that the 50% offer included a bottle of wine, hence did not order that.</body>

        <body>Took a 2 course deal at this French restaurant that nowadays seems to serve a lot of Italian dishes. The service is a bit haphazard but my goats cheese starter and tuna main were tasty. The place has nothing to soak up the sound so is very noisy and has no need of tinned music on low in the background. The a la carte is expensive for the place it is and so is a glass of wine,; no wonder they do deals. Would probably be better off decreasing cost of food and wine so not having to do constant deals; but I am sure they have their reasons.</body>

        <body>several visits here food good value using toptable 50% offer. Service on top form as usual, had a query with discount on bill, waiter solved in minutes. All dishes cooked to our preferences with minimal waiting time. Downside - wine was expensive for average sauvignon. We liked the space around the table. Will return.</body>

        <body>As I&apos;ve just switched jobs and am now frequently in Covent Garden I&apos;ve decided to make Cafe des Amis my new go-to restaurant. I came here for the second week running and - surprise, surprise! - another great meal! I enjoyed the special soup with was really tasty, followed by the Tagliatelle, Wild Mushroom, Chicken Supreme - was really comforting and delicious. My partner enjoyed the  salmon fish cakes - simple but hit the spot perfectly. Best of all, you can&apos;t go wrong with the 50% off deal and the new wine list is fantastic (is it bad to drink during the day!?!).</body>

        <body>Cafe des Amis does not disappoint.    The ser vice is smooth and unobtrusive making it an ideal place for pre-theatre meals.  I have been eating here for several years which I think is a good enough recommendation.</body>

        <body>Post ballet at the Royal Opera House, my partner and I went to Cafe des Amis for a romantic dinner. My partner is in a wheel chair and found it easy to gain access to the restaurant. We were greeted and seated almost instantly, with the waiting staff aware we were requiring an accessible table. The food on the menu had altered slightly from the one published in advance which threw us a bit but was still lovely. We had a 3 course meal and found the food to be fantastic. Once we had finished and paid the bill we were not rushed to leave (even with them being busy for valentines), and had time to finish drinks and book taxis. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wanted to splash out on a nice evening meal.</body>

        <body>The food and service started well but once the mains were finished the service was poor. Several people standing around paying no attention to their guests. We had to ask for the desert menu!! Not acceptable for the price of the menu.  And then the food, my wife got food poisoning and spent the night being sick. The starter and main had come out too quickly and had quite obviously been sitting on the side! Not a place I&apos;ll be visiting again and would only suggest that those who do go beware!!</body>

        <body>Good restaurant, attentive service in a great location.  The menu&apos;s fine, but very overpriced, but as there&apos;s nearly always an offer available the prices are brought down to a reasonable level.  Don&apos;t even think about eating there if you&apos;re not on a deal.</body>

Would thoroughly recommend  it.  Lambs liver, steak and duck confit favorites, although have tried most of menu and all has been consistently good.</body>

        <body>The calamari was undercooked yet still tough. The ravioli was similarly undercooked. My duck came with one single lardon, and the much-feted chocolate soup was basically warm cake batter in a bowl. The black pepper ice cream was delicious, but a bit late for redemption at that point. Prices with the special offer (50% off) were acceptable - without them it would have been extortionate for very average food.</body>

        <body>We booked a table at this restaurant when we were visiting London.  The food service and ambience were all one could wish for.  We would highly recommend it.  We were welcomed and served by polite staff and the food was so good we returned 2 days later.  Our first visit was early evening in the restaurant but on our second visit we went to the bar downstairs.  Again we were welcomed by polite staff and we had a light lunch, perfect start for afternoon sight seeing.</body>

        <body>We had a meal on a Saturday evening at Cafe Des Amis. We had booked for 7 o&apos;clock but had to wait to be seated as the table wasn&apos;t ready. This was no problem to us, we were a group of 8 and the staff were attemtive and apologetic. We had a good meal although we only found out when we came to settle the bill that the offer advertised only applied to 3 course meals. We had a very pleasant evening though. This was our second visit to the restaurant and, as before, the staff were very attentive even though they were very busy.</body>

        <body>The front of house lady was sullen and preoccupied which should have warned us about what was to follow.  The food arrived in seconds - a little too fast to convince anyone that anything but a microwave was involved.   They clearly have a deal on with the pesto oil supplier because it was showered onto both our starters and both our mains. My over cooked tuna steak was inedible as it continued to swim in the oil.   My crime brûlée was average at best and, given that we were both far too cold to be comfortable, we escaped to have a coffee somewhere (anywhere) better</body>

        <body>Booked at short notice and largely drawn by the price.  The restaurant was fairly empty but that enabled prompt and attentive service by the staff.  Food was quite good, nothing too elaborate but some signs of an effort having been made and certainly was good value for the price.   The bill contained a mistaken double charge, which was swiftly corrected when pointed out.   In sum not too bad, Ive tried it but wont be rushing back when there are so many other places to visit.</body>

        <body>It wasn&apos;t clear that the 50% only to the starter and main course. We had nibbles plate and dessert and have to pay full price although it is on the A La Carte menu.  I think it should be making clear when book at the conditions so the diners known from start.</body>

        <body>This is the second time i&apos;ve been to eat at the restaurant, it&apos;s become one of my favourite places to eat before a show. The staff are always friendly and attentive, the atmosphere has been buzzing every time even for an afternoon meal. The food is top notch and very tasty, i shall be returning with more people and i would recommend to all my friends. I will be using this place to eat every time i attend a theatre show. Well done Cafe Des Amis, you made my afternoon today one to remember.</body>

        <body>We visited the restaurant on Sunday 29th March.  We opted for the 50% off your  starter  an main an a free bottle of wine when ordering three courses. You could choose off the full a la carte menu which is good as you usually get a set menu in other restaurants.the staff were very attentive and made you feel very welcome.the food was excellent quality and served at a leisurely pace to suit ourselves. The ambiance was very nice but the background music was very intermittent. The only downside to the restaurant was the standard of the toilets which my wife agreed had deteriorated a lot since our last visit. But overall as usual our visit and food were a pleasurable experience.</body>

        <body>Pasta dish did not look as if it was freshly prepared.   Dessert crepe was also served cold when I expected it to have been freshly prepared and therefore warm. Would have commented to staff when asked if everything was okay, but was in conversation with friend and distracted. No disabled toilet . Service was good.</body>

        <body>We have been here so many times, it&apos;s our favourite place to eat in London!! Always good value, even if you don&apos;t have an &quot;offer&quot;. I signed up to cafe des Amis a few years go, found them through Time Out, have  told so many friends about them, have taken family there to. This visit was to finish the day, as we had been in London all day , we had the offer menu for 2 with a glass of wine each £29 if you want dessert and coffe that&apos;s extra, but even then it&apos;s still a very good meal The staff are excellent, and welcome children. We have tried so many other restaurants in London, to us this is the best. The vegetarian options are good to. If its your birthday you will receive a message telling wht treat there&apos;s waiting for you, for me there was a bottle of prosecco. Please try as you won&apos;t be dissappointed !! 10/10</body>

        <body>I always enjoy the ambience at Cafe des Amis! For me, It is too expensive without the 50% discount and free bottle of wine! With the offer it is a great place to be! The tuna tartar was gorgeous, the tuna main delightful and cheesecake a wow!  My partner was a wow too which always helps! More seriously, the lady who greeted us upon arrival was extremely pleasant, service excellent we&apos;ll be back! For as long as the offer is on!</body>

        <body>On arrival, our table wasn&apos;t ready so we had to go downstairs to their wine bar to wait. When we were given our table for three it still wasn&apos;t ready, insufficient glasses and cutlery which was only noticed when they brought drinks and food. Not a great experience.  We came here on the recommendation of a friend, I&apos;m wondering if it was the same restaurant!  The food, was distinctly average. Our mains were cold, as if they had been sat under the lights a while. My pasta sauce was growing a skin. Ugh.  We had the 50% off deal- which only covers starter and mains (which we found out at the bill stage). I wouldn&apos;t pay their 100% prices at all. Even at 50% off it was a struggle.  The service was surly and slow, the food average. It was a birthday celebration for the two others I was with, which I had made clear in the booking, and wasn&apos;t acknowledged at all. Which was a disappointment really.  When the bill arrived, we found that service wasn&apos;t an optional extra. That really gets my goat,</body>

        <body>It is always a pleasure to meet friends at Café des Amis.We stayed for nearly 3 hours and the service was perfect. This time we didn&apos;t make good use of the offers so it wasn&apos;t such goood value, but that was our fault. Still highly recommended.</body>

        <body>This is one of my staples as it normally offers such great deals however on this occasion we were left disappointed. We went on the 50% of a la carte and a free bottle of wine but after eating and ordering a second bottle of wine were surprised to be charged for 2 bottles. Although this was not mentioned in our confirmation email at all apparently we had to have 3 courses to get the first bottle free. I&apos;m pretty sure this was never the case but was told it had always been so. They did kindly say that we could order 4 desserts to get the first bottle free but we declined as it would have cost just as much as the wine. Buyer beware here I think and read the small print.</body>

        <body>Restaurant serves both Italian and French food, however it claims as beeing French and the quality of the food is very poor and way too expensive. I am glad I had 50% off on food with my discount card. Unfortunately this was my first and last visit.</body>

We had to run for the theatre because they took so long. Good was mediocre. Cheapest red wine is £26?! Should have gone to pizza express for a better all around experience!</body>

        <body>I have always found Café Des Amis to be an extremely busy and stylish place to take friends for lunch or dinner. Great value too with 50% off food and free bottle of wine when booked through open table. This time I was disappointed with my main course which was a very tired, several times reheated fishcake! But, my partner and friend were delighted with their flavoursome linguine.....I do hope Cafe Des Amis continues to appreciate it&apos;s popularity and does not become complacent and let standards slip. Upon reflection without the 50% discount the service and quality of food would have been disappointing. Maybe they are too busy catering for a high turnover to really be considered as a serious restaurant without the 50%.</body>

        <body>I took my mum and sister here for mothers day and I have to say it was disappointing. We had a 50% off deal thank goodness, but the food wasn&apos;t up to standard with tough pasta and watery sauces. The staff were nice and helpful, but we did wait a long time for our bill and my mum was given a basket of raisin bread to go with her moules...   Such a shame as I went there several years ago and it was excellent. Fine for a quick lunch before a show, but that&apos;s all.</body>

        <body>Visited Cafe des Amis againafter a concert at the Royal Albert Hall -well worth the walk across London for outstanding food . Excellent value with 50% off the food bill from the A La Carte menu &amp; certainly no effort to have a minimum of two courses but my partner &amp; I were tempted to have three anyway !!  We will definitely be back - good service, very pleasant staff &amp; outstanding food.</body>

        <body>I booked Café des Amis via an online offer, something I understand they do regularly. There was no voucher to take so we mentioned the offer to our server when we were given the full priced menu and she then told us that there were 2 valid offers that night.    Given the noise level and speed of delivery the offers were difficult to understand but we chose 2 courses with a free half bottle of wine per person.   The meal was adequate and good value given the offer but if we had not asked we would presumably have just paid the very high prices shown on the menu.  Unlike the food that sort of confusion marketing leaves a nasty taste.    Good value and not bad if you get an offer but otherwise don&apos;t bother.</body>

        <body>2 course meal &amp; 1/2 bottle of wine!  Are you kidding me!? What an exceptional and delicious meal at an incredible value.  The wine they provide on the meal is delicious and regular 26£ for the bottle I believe.  Very good food. We had the Sunday roast (you do have a selection to choose from) and it was excellent.  I  think I will return every weekend!  Highly recommend!</body>

        <body>The restaurant called to confirm our reservation and were fine when I said we might be slightly late and that we weren&apos;t in a hurry so didn&apos;t want to be rushed off our table.  It was very busy (6pm Saturday to be fair) and we had to wait quite a while just to get our drinks.  Food was very average - okay but had that sense of mass catering about it.  However, it was nice and we were well looked after until we came to pay the bill.  Although we had said we were on a deal when we arrived the restaurant has so many deals that even they don&apos;t seem to know what they have!  The manageress virtually accused me of lying saying she would check the website!  I was incredibly polite - considering I had 5 guests and suggested she did just that.  Our amended bill did eventually arrive (after we had to ask for it again) but no apology or acknowledgement.  A shame really; mistakes happen and we weren&apos;t looking for a fight however the difference was £15 per head - significant!  So if you do choose to</body>

        <body>Took advantage of the 50% of a la carte plus bottle of wine. Then found out the 50% only applied to the starters &amp; mains. Desserts were described as between £5 &amp; £8, but all except one were at the top price... The starters were fine, &amp; the fish &amp; lamb mains were OK proportions if not massive. However, with a £3 supplement  on the calf&apos;s liver I have to say it was a joke! one small sliver on a teacup of mash for £14.50 (after the deal was applied) is not what i call good value! Overall quite expensive too -  Lamb was £28.50 less 50% plus £3 i.e. £17.25 for two average lumps. A classic case of doubling the price &amp; halving the portions so not a 50% off deal at all  Wouldn&apos;t rush back &amp; would have complained heartily except didn&apos;t want to spoil Mum&apos;s mothers day evening out</body>

        <body>We like the Cafe des Amis. Been here a couple of times before and always been well treated and fed. Pre theatre menu excellent value for Covent Garden. We went for half price and free wine. The wine was acceptable the food better and the service impeccable as we kept changing our minds. Need to book before 1900. There were spare tables after that.</body>

        <body>If you were to look up &apos;good&apos; - not &apos;great&apos; in the dictionary, surely Cafe des Amis would come up. You don&apos;t come here to be blown away by innovation - but for good, consistent, reliable food and drink, particularly when going to a West End show or nearby opera or ballet performance. Whilst the menu is in line with the neighbourhood; i.e. not cheap, with the menu offers eating and drinking here is very, very high value.</body>

        <body>On arrival we seemed to be a slight irritation to staff in the middle of lunch service. We were seated but forgotten.Eventually staff caught up and the service was then friendly enough. We had booked a 50% off deal - at first sight good but a la carte prices seemed inflated by around 33% to part compensate. Food was good but no outstanding and portion sizes fair. But the wine was extremely expensive - house wines starting at over £23?</body>

        <body>I have now been twice to this restaurant and I have found it absolutely fabulous.  The food is not particularly cheap but the offers make it affordable particularly when you&apos;re going to the theatre as well. The main selling point is the speed of the service and efficiency without making you feel that it is rushed.  The  offer menu has enough on it to make you feel that it is worthwhile and everything is very nice palatable and  nicely presented.</body>

        <body>Luckily I had taken advantage of the excellent pre-paid voucher offer (2 courses from the a la carte plus a glass of house wine for 2 people for just £29.99) because had I paid the full price I would have been bitterly disappointed. The place itself is fine, with a good atmosphere and fantastically located for the Royal Opera House. The service was very good. The house wine was surprisingly good too. My son enjoyed his starter of tuna tartare, but the moules for his main course simply weren&apos;t fresh, the sauce was bland, and it was served with toasted garlic bread which was &apos;undunkable&apos;. My starter of duck confit salad was OK - I wouldn&apos;t order it again. For my main course I chose the home-made pappardelle (the pasta itself was lovely) with salmon, shrimp and mussels. The mussels were placed around the dish and were cold. The salmon &amp; shrimp sauce was uninspiring - certainly not worth the full menu price. You live and learn.</body>

        <body>Located centrally for theatre land ,this restaurant has great potential. Unfortunately the food which was ok,was generally uninspiring. The worst thing was the lack of coordination between the staff.They are all very pleasant but there seems to be no leader taking charge of front of house. For example, my starter came up very very quickly,followed very quickly by my main ,which was served whilst I was away from the table.We then had to wait 25-30 minutes to order our dessert , by which time we had lost interest . We were in no rush as we had already been to the theatre,but the lack of cohesion throughout the meal spoilt the evening  a little. Food served more like a bistro but at restaurant prices , shame.</body>

        <body>My boyfriend and I were recommended by my parents to go and the food was good. We both had steak and while it was a little fatty mine was cooked perfectly. The salads we had to start were only average for the £8 price tag. The main thing that let it down was the hurried service. If you have a show to go to then this is perfect but we went at 7pm. You would not be having a two course meal at 7pm if you had a show to see at 7.30pm, so I thought it was unnecessary to serve our main directly after clearing our starter plates.   But they were pleasant staff.</body>

        <body>This restaurant, hidden away on a small street in Covent Garden is such a lovely place to dine. There is a good choice of food on the menu, the starters are particulary nice as are the desserts, if you have room left after your main! Pre or post theatre it all adds to a great day out, without breaking the bank.</body>

        <body>After a bit of a break from this restaurant (opting to go to the new @Cellar des Amis, instead), I came back for a nice mid-week lunch. As ever, it was tasty meal with amicable, helpful service. I enjoyed a glass of Champagne, followed by the tasty Soupe du Jour, followed by the moreish chicken supreme a la creme served on top of tagliatelle. There are plenty of more adventurous restaurants in London but this place is consistent - always good food and drink here!</body>

        <body>Been here quite a few times and would go again on the offer of 50% off total bill, which is excellent value. 7 of us dined recently Ambience was lovely, service excellent , most of the food very enjoyable. However, 2 people were vegetarians and there was only 2 options for main course. Either spinach and ricotta ravioli or wild mushroom risotto. Not very imaginative. The ravioli was OK but the risotto was a very small portion placed in the middle of the plate and looked very unappetising. It was also very bland.  The sea bass and gnocchi was a good portion and very tasty but swimming in olive oil. I had to drain it before eating.  Generally enjoyed though.</body>

        <body>Shockingly poor food - cannot imagine why we were recommended to dine here.  No ambience whatsoever - being the only people in the restaurant.  So called Bellini contained some very nasty artificial peach syrup.  Our starters were revolting and my daughters was stone cold.  Main course vegetables looked like something my dog had brought up.  A very expensive mistake I will not be making again.</body>

        <body>The food is lovely and interesting (I hear the inminent new menu even more so). The calamari salad (starter) is fantastic and I would have it again without hesitation.  Overall, food is a fair value for money but watch out for the cocktails ... nice but very pricy.  Also, if you are a foody on a budget, beware of the 15% service charge that gets added to the bill automatically unless you want to argue the point. The staff are very nice and helpful so we could bring ourselves to ... it adds up.</body>

        <body>Food was well below average, and the choice was pretty pathetic. I accept it is a temporary arrangement, but I would have thought somewhere of this reputed class and price could have come up with more than 5 options. The starter came in about 3 minutes so clearly pre made, and then we had to wait 25 minutes for the plate to be cleared, and another 15 minutes for the mains. When I was finally asked by the &apos;waiter&apos; if I could take my plate, and replied yes please, as it&apos;s been there far too long, his response was that it was my fault, because my arm on the table was somehow hiding the fact that I had finished. What?? Mickey mouse would have given a more professional service, pathetic. Needless to say, I will not be going back for another overpriced disappointing meal.</body>

        <body>This was our 5th visit to this restaurant and unfortunately will probably be our last! Previous we have enjoyed excellent food and service however sadly since the referb things have clearly changed which is such a shame particularly as we had used this visit to celebrate our son&apos;s birthday and this was his first visit having, heard very good reports from us following our previous dining experiences - he was clearly disappointed! As other reviewers have mentioned the style of the restaurant has changed and in our opinion has moved down market but the price hasn&apos;t!! The food is still good but the choice on the menu is now very limited. Why change something that was clearly working well??</body>

        <body>The food was absolutely incredible, and the service was excellent.  Not the cheapest option, but you definitely get quality food in a great setting, very central too.  Cocktails a little pricey but very tasty.  Cannot recommend the ceviche, calamari and steak enough - they were all amazing.</body>

        <body>Located just down the road from the London Coliseum, this is a great option for late after-opera/ballet dinner after having seen a show at the ENO. The ambience is fantastic as is the decor and the toilets are unique once you figure out the locking system.  The food doesn&apos;t disappoint either, with a great mix of Brazilian and East Asian influences, well cooked and generous portions. The staff are very attentive and helpful. The only downside is the expense, it is very pricey and the deals from Opentable aren&apos;t really helpful in keeping the costs down which means that this is only for those special once in a while occasions!</body>

        <body>First reaction was that this was a hotel restaurant and all the negatives that this can sometimes imply.  But it was absolutely fantastic, with intriguing menu offers (it was difficult to select) and superb tastes and flavours.  Perfect staff and great surroundings.  Highly recommended.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve loved this restaurant for years. Haben&apos;t been for  2 years, though. The menu completely changed ... also the style of everything. Unfortunately the quality as well. My son had a stak that was un-eatable. We had to beg everytime to get our glasses re-filled (we had a bottle of wine). Not amongs my favorites anymore ..</body>

        <body>Staff were hugely accommodating when people ran very late! The food was really delicious and due to party size it was served banquet style so we had lots of variety and there was more than enough to go round. We were also moving seats throughout the meal and the staff were very accommodating to that too. The atmosphere was great - buzzing but not too noisy. All in all a really excellent experience.</body>

        <body>Having dined at Asia de Cuba many times before and loved it, I was very dissappointed this time. I had arranged the dinner for my Father&apos;s birthday so the whole family was there. When we turned up we were told that we could not dine in the restaurant itself as it was closed to the public for refurbishment - instead we were seated in a pop-up restaurant. This was something I was not made aware of when booking. I&apos;m sorry to say that whilst the food was good, the experience was not the same. The pop-up restaurant was empty, there was no background noise and the wait staff weren&apos;t as attentive. The reason I booked Asia de Cuba for my Father&apos;s birthday was because of the ambience and interesting decor of the restaurant - if I had been told of the refurbishment I would not have dined there at this time.</body>

        <body>booked this restaurant on my experience of Philippe stark decoration back in Paris :-) However the service is outstanding every one is caring of you (sometimes too much) The choice of meals is broad enough to satisfy any kind of taste.  Pit is quite expensive but we had a very pleasant experience I recommend</body>

        <body>Pre Theatre and A La Carte Menus were pretty much the same.  The Pre Theatre was value for money so would suggest to go for this. The food was average in taste not hugely special and really not enough choice for my liking.</body>

        <body>Pop-up restaurant lacked ambience. Main restaurant and Light Bar closed for renovation. no mention of this when I booked. No obvious effort to mark Valentines Day except fixed price, no choice menu. Expensive for what was offered.</body>

        <body>The outside of the hotel gives nothing away about this interesting, original and gorgeous restaurant where the excellent service represents the delicious food.  Each detail down to the lighting in the toilets was obviously well thought through and the service was unquestionable even with a slightly late bowl of Asia-Cuba &apos;fries&apos;.</body>

        <body>I picked Asia de Cuba for my birthday lunch.  The place was going through a refurbishment and the restaurant was set in a temporary room with a similar decor, however the whole lunch was accompanied by loud drilling and banging. The restaurant let me know last moment with no warning about the noise.   The starter was good. My main course stake was the worst I have had. It came cold and tough. When I asked for a stake knif I was told that they don&apos;t have any. Some of the yucca chips were so hard I couldn&apos;t even cut through them.  They must have been training their kitchen porter to a back up cook or something.   The deserts were excellent I must say.   The staff was friendly and attentive.   Lunch for two was over £100. The dinner menu has prices doubled! Overall not a good experience, the whole stay felt very provisional.</body>

        <body>Went for my birthday celebration with friends from Africa and USA. Was disappointed with the ambience. The main restaurant is under construction. If I had know I would have dined somewhere else. As the dining area was cold and not impressive. The wait staff and food was good.</body>

        <body>This was return visit to Asia de Cuba for us and whilst the food remains good we did feel that the portions have become quite small especially the Black Cod which didn&apos;t even go round 4 people. The lighting in the restaurant was extremely dark, I know that other diners felt the same as  one complained and the lights were turned up.</body>

        <body>What a place! From the entrance hall with oversized furniture bathed in yellow light, to the quirky interior of the restaurant itself, with a pot plant wall, quilted chesterfield pillar and mock library pillar. It&apos;s Alice in Wonderland meets Willy Wonka&apos;s factory in terms of wonder. The food is a fascinating fusion, as the name would suggest, with flavours bursting from all the dishes we sampled. The staff accomplished the perfect balance for us too, friendly and welcoming in perfect measure. What a wonderful place.</body>

        <body>My husband and I had been to this restaurant before for an afternoon tea and enjoyed it so much,  that we decided to have a nice lunch.  Our waitress was Sophia. She was lovely, and greeted us with a smile and recommended the perfect cocktail.  Sophia looked after us so we&apos;ll and the other tables so well, that you could tell that she loved her job and the people. She is and the other waitress on that day an assist to your team at Asia da Cuba.</body>

        <body>Have the black cod, but order smaller bites too as it is tiny but extremely tasty.  Also had some of the Cerviches and they were wonderful.....staff were attentive and chatty wonderful &quot;den&quot; with interesting art installations - my favourite was the stormy sea and boat but the cricket painting was also good - see if you can spot the cricket ball.  The bar was dark and intimate (hard to read the menu as numerous mobile phone lights went on and off throughout the night).  Save your battery and engage with the staff - they mad a bespoke mocktail for us non-drinkers.  For those that have been in the city all day a cloakroom for your day bags so you can be free in the nigh time.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve eaten at various Asia de Cuba locations over the years and have made a point to always come back. I&apos;ve been to the Covent Gardens location 4 times, Miami South Beach 2x, etc. In my recent trip to this location (St. Martin Hotel) I was very disappointed. Not only have they changed the menu (not for the better) but the service was horrible. Sad to say that my decade long affair with Asia de Cuba has come to an end.</body>

        <body>But not any more- it has become just regular restaurant with not ironed tabele cloth , cheap glasses and to attentive staff, who behave like apologising. It was better before redecorating, it was busier and with great food menus and athmosphere...to come there was a special event ... And now it s one of many restaurants-were more than disappointed :(</body>

        <body>Founded by Jamie Oliver, Barbecoa is much more than a steak restaurant ? it?s a celebration of fire-based cooking and incredible, quality ingredients. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our in-house butchers handpick and prepare the very best meat from farms around Britain, then our chefs use it to create beautiful, modern dishes making the most of Texas pit smokers, tandoors, fire pits, robata grills and wood-fired ovens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You?ll feel the heat, see the flames lick and the smoke drift upwards from our open kitchen as you indulge in one of our beautiful cocktails or a glass of whisky from our impressive selection.</body>

        <body>Treated my boyfriend for his birthday, and was not disappointed! Everything was perfect from the welcome greeting, to the service throughout our meal, the view of St. Paul&apos;s and the best part was the steak which was cooked perfectly, abit disappointed I didn&apos;t have room for dessert!</body>

        <body>Barbecoa has a high standard meat cuts, cooked at the perfect term; all the rest of the kitchen is disappointing from all points of view: overcooked and greasy vegetables, burn mushrooms all served in a unattractive way, together with an overpriced wine list, makes this restaurant a once-in-a-lifetime place to be visited.</body>

        <body>Amazing steaks- best I&apos;ve tasted almost ever!! Medium was more medium/rare but I was glad actually. Try the incredible green olives on ice! Great decor/ atmosphere and views but only if you sit on the right side of the table otherwise you get a blank wall/ the bar/ waiting area for serving staff- it would be better if the tables were sideways to the view so that more diners can enjoy. Good portion sizes. More side options needed- green salads etc. it would be better if you could choose your steak topping as the sirloin came with sweet onions and balsamic dressing which I loved but may not be to everyone&apos;s taste. The hand cut chips were a bit disappointing. Staff friendly but forgot items and it was always a different person- it felt a bit rushed rather than leisurely which wad a shame given the price! Also we were near the kitchen door and it felt rather frenetic as there were always about 6 staff milling around- they seem incredibly well staffed! Not as relaxing as it couldve been. A</body>

        <body>Good food (a little pricey), great views, great location, very comfortable tables/ seating arrangements in plush leather sofa-like seats facing each other across corners.  Poor disability access (had to bring wheel chair of my parents from way back of the building.. took us forever).. should be an elevator into the main restaurant floor from the ground floor entrance.</body>

        <body>Food excellent as always, only criticism is the portion sizes can beat you! The apple ketchup with the pork scratching a was fantastic.  The service left a little to be desired seemingly mixing too fast at times (between courses) and too slow when looking to order drinks or food.  Hard to find value on the wines so it does push the cost up.  Overall great meat and fish every time I have been and always happy to return.</body>

        <body>First time at Barbecoa. Simply amazing. Friendly greeting at the reception, after which we were directed upstairs to one of the best seats in the house - a view directly opposite St Pauls cathedral. Staff were welcoming and service was excellent and efficient. Food was superb. It was more expensive than I would normally spend time on an evening meal, but definitely worth it.</body>

        <body>Sorry to have to this negative, but the whole experience was awful.  Table wasn&apos;t ready, greeter was apologetic but it was obvious she didn&apos;t really give a hoot - and when pressed a second time blamed it on customers exceeding their time (your policy, hon).  Music was so loud it was hard to talk across a small round table.  At 9.30pm, four mains were not available anymore limiting the choice somewhat.  Three of our mains arrived, with the fourth arriving more than 5 minutes and two requests later - not acceptable, no apology.  At £33 a pop for a steak, you expect a perfectly cooked piece of meat.  Not so - it was just ordinary, slightly more cooked than I had asked for, and dry.  Jamie, you need to rethink this, fella.  Try Hawksmore, Hix in Soho (not Tramshed), or even Gaucho for much, much better cows.</body>

        <body>I think it&apos;s fair to say that the team loved everything about Barbacoa. Excellent food, service and venue. Would recommend the prime and fillet steaks and the carpaccio starter was sublime.  We need to come back to experience more of the whiskey selection.  Thanks for having us - we&apos;ok hopefully be back soon!</body>

        <body>Me and one other shared  the ribs and cheviche, obviously very different flavours. The Cheviche was not alot for the money, but still tasty and fresh,  The ribs were very good value, and amazing! I had the double pork chop, it was huge, and took me ages to get through it, but I  impressed the waiter with finsihing it-I could of done a heads up on how huge it was though. My friend had the slow roasted and was very impressed. Our shared sides were good sizes the mushrooms were amazing! We shared the bacon and bourbon sundae-definlty a good size to share.</body>

        <body>The ambience of Barbacoa is so romantic. The lighting is perfect for the chilled and sophisticated atmosphere. The views of St Paul&apos;s are breathtaking - even at night.  The staff were very attentive, but not overbearing. Davide was our waiter, and he was fabulous, He described the dishes in great detail, and recommended some great food. I have many allergies, and he was very thoughtful and careful to make sure that everything I ordered was suitable and that I was happy.  A wonderful experience,</body>

        <body>Barbecoa is not a restaurant when you want to enjoy a nice dinner for 2. It&apos;s incredibly crowded which explains the constant and loud noise. My wife and I almost had to scream to understand each other. Even the waiter didn&apos;t understand us as he forgot the bread (which is not for free by the way) we&apos;ve ordered. The food was okay but definitely not worth the price. I&apos;ve eaten better and larger steaks at better and normal grill restaurants. The appetizer wasn&apos;t good at all, looked and tasted more like a cheap soda. We got the starter even before the appetizer. For 1 appetizer, a very ordinary starter, a main course with some chips and 1 glass of wine, we paid about 140£. I don&apos;t mind paying for quality food but this was too expensive for the quality and environment that we got. The flavors were also very ordinary, nothing special. We should have known up front but it was definitely not a good experience. Guess you pay the name Jamie Oliver which is a shame. Much ado about nothing.</body>

        <body>is not cheap - but is worth the money  good service, ambience, food  only down side i can think of - is how closely set the tables are - they are very close together (even on a week night) and hence getting up out of your seat is not good. nor is the fact you can be heard and hear the tables next to you.</body>

        <body>Food was excellent, the pit beef was amazing!! couldnt fault a thing.  However!! Not impressed with the 12.5% service charge added to our bill, we ordered a £250 bottle of champagne  which had a high enough mark up on it and to add another 12.5% to that i think is a joke, our bill for 4 people including the champagne was nearly £550, we were only there 2.5 hours i think a £70 tip is crazy!! i must be in the wrong job!!</body>

        <body>I saw a Google review when booking this that suggested it was overpriced for the quality and you would be better going to Bodeans if you wanted bbq-style food. Having now been, I completely agree.  Knowing a friend that works locally, I understand it is perhaps the kind of place best saved for when you are expensing a business lunch. I was catching up with a friend from out of town, purely socially, and we were both disappointed. The ambience was nice and our waitress was charming but we did feel as though the staff were trying to rush us. Our meal arriving within five minutes of ordering didn&apos;t alleviate such concerns. Maybe we ordered badly but the meat wasn&apos;t any better than the aforementioned Bodeans, though I did enjoy the bbq baked beans with burnt ends in. I won&apos;t be going back.</body>

        <body>Great food, beautiful view of St Pauls, good service. All in all a great night. The starters are a little overpriced and on the small side, but the steak was to die for and the portions are very generous. The sides were also delicious. The waiter could have been a little more attentive topping up the wine, but it was very busy. Definitely recommend this for a special occasion!</body>

        <body>My wife and I went to Barbecoa in September for our wedding anniversary and when it came time to pick a restaurant in London for her birthday, this was number one on our list.  The food as per last was simply superb!  My wife loves sampling the different cocktails and every food that was brought to tables near us made our mouths water and develop food envy - until ours arrived!  We&apos;ll definitely going back, easily our favourite restaurant!</body>

        <body>A disappointing start when we asked about allergies - all paranoia and no information or help deciding what could be eaten. Ended up with talking to manager as the waitress just repeated bland statements. He was better but then the food came it was very average and one dish was not what was ordered... We decided not to stay for dessert!</body>

        <body>Gorgeous food, beautiful ambience with great location and a view of St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral. The staff were excellent. I have special dietary requirements and my waiter was the most knowledgable of the menu that I have ever come across, leaving me totally reassured and able to enjoy the meal. And enjoy I did- it was delicious. Top quality meat packed with flavour, and stylish deco- it is upmarket but not stupidly overpriced.</body>

        <body>The Barbecoa is a &quot;club style&quot; restaurant. Meat lovers have to go! We had a 3 course diner. The food was very good, the service of our waitresse was great &quot;darling&quot;. The only downside was that it felt that they were rushing. The entree and main followed in a very quick tempo. I would advise to take a bit more time in between, for me it would have resulted in drinking an extra glass of wine.  Overall a great experience. When w&apos;ll vissit London again w&apos;ll join this restaurant for sure.</body>

        <body>The mains I define as &quot;meh&quot; and we struggled to finish the fries as they weren&apos;t that appealing. Meat heavy, dark decor, the only redeeming feature was the dessert plate.</body>

        <body>My husband and I have been looking forward to visiting the restaurant for a long time and we were not disapointed. We had a nice table with a lovely view at St. Pauls&apos;. The food was excellent (I would especially recommend the rips for a starter which were delicious) and the service friendly and attentive. The noise level was quite  high but this might be normal in a completely booked out restaurant. We are from Austria and have not tested any other Steak houses in London for comparison, but the Barbecoa is definitely a good choice unless you prefer to have your meal in a more quiet and intimate atmosphere.</body>

        <body>I have visited the restaurant with my family who was here visiting. We got an amazing table with St Paul&apos;s cathedral in the back drop. The food was excellent , very tasty and huge portions. 3 of us had steak and one had the pork chops, we tried 5 different side dishes. Unfortunately there was no room for dessert as we were super full after our main courses.  We even had to ask for a doggy bag. I would definitely go back or recommend it to friends.</body>

        <body>A special meal out for my husbands birthday.  I asked for a window table and got a fantastic table for two overlooking St. Paul&apos;s; I really loved the whole atmosphere and styling of the dining room.  As with all JO restaurants I have eaten in, from his chain Italian to Fifteen, the service was just right - friendly, informative, timed perfectly without a hint of snootiness which is often all too prevalent in London restaurants. Fab cocktails - particularly the candy bar. Favourite courses were the pigs cheek (very good pickled veg), ribs 3 ways - truly delicious and the peanut butter and cherry cheesecake - I was sharing it but should have had one to myself!! All in all one of the best meals I have had in London for quite a while.</body>

        <body>We dined at Barbecoa on a Sunday evening for my brother&apos;s birthday. Had a roomy table for 5 with a superb view of St Paul&apos;s cathedral. Good wine list and aperitifs. The Portuguese red wine was excellent. We ordered crispy pig cheeks, smoked duck, burger, ribs, rump, calamari, but chicken wings. All was excellent except the smoked duck starter which was cold. Tasty chips. Would go again.</body>

        <body>I was in a group of 6 and we all really enjoyed our meals. The starters, mains and desserts were all great and the drinks selection is very good too.  The only annoyance was the hassle before we arrived. I received a phone call on the day of the booking to confirm we were still coming, which is pretty standard these days. But then I received another phone call to ask AGAIN if we were still coming. This was at exactly the time the booking was for so I felt it was a bit unnecessary considering I had confirmed the booking only a few hours previous and we weren&apos;t even 5 minutes late at the time of the call.</body>

        <body>I had been to Barbecoa at lunchtime during the week where the experience was laid back and chilled. So I had expected something similar for our evening visit.  However the restaurant had been turned into an expensive canteen, where diners were piled high and sold food not so cheap! It felt like Mr Oliver had produced a conveyor belt as the dining experience, and his eyes must have been lighting up as the cash rolled in!  Food was good, but we felt like we&apos;d been pick pocketed rather than served quality food.</body>

        <body>The steak wasn&apos;t really worth the cost. Although the meat was good quality,  it was a bit burnt on the outside and a bit tough for a medium. Not what I expected as similar steaks at other restaurants are more worth the cost.  Also the mash potato was somewhat watery.  The wings for starters was very nice though and tasty.  All in all not sure I would go there again.</body>

        <body>I had requested a Gluten free meal.  It seems you dont cater for gluten free specifically.  You know that meat is GF and the vegetables are, but there is no attempt to modify any other foods to make the choice for a coeliac more enjoyable.  So I ate meat and veg.  You brought a standard menu, and there was nothing on the standard menu for dessert that was available either.    In summary it was a really poor attempt you even rang me and confirmed that one person was gluten free.  I would rather have you told me that you dont cater for GF easily.   As a result,  I wont eat here again or at any other Jamie Oliver restaurants.</body>

        <body>First of all: the view is great, but only if you get seated next to that single table row in front of the cathedral. However, all what you can get there you can get anywhere else for less money. There is nothing special. The food was okay, but not special. The restaurant is extremely noisy, it is like in a train station hall. It is more or less unacceptable. We expected more for the money. In total we paid for two starters, the main course, and one dessert, one glas of wine, two Prosseco, two coffee and one water in total 145 Pound. That I can get for less.</body>

        <body>Barbecoa is a steak house. And when it comes to steaks these were very tasty (although not the best steak I&apos;ve tasted). Service and ambience of the restaurant were also very good. On the con side, the table was rather small for 4-people making eating uncomfortable. The prices were way too expensive (competing with Michelin star restaurants while not being one).  Overall, if you are around it is worth to try it, if you plan ahead you can find better.</body>

        <body>We have compared the restaurant to the one just 50 meters away from the other leading cooking guru in England. Unfortunately the Barbecoa has been only the second place.  The food has been OK, but not really outstanding. Some of us have choosen even the same dishes - JO has not delivered the better once...  Also the service has not been that good - we have not received any bread with butter or any cream to start the evening diner. I would have expected that.  The wine list has been good. But no help from any sommelier showing up. Having a wide knowledge myself I had no problem with it - but rather estonishing in this class of restaurants.  Over all I think for a price of 70 pounds per person I would have expected a bit better performance. I would rather recommend the restaurant around the corner....</body>

        <body>I have been here in several occasion and have always enjoed my meals. Portions are generous and I never manage to finish them.  I ordered the Dover sole from the menu but they didn&apos;t had that one so the waitress offered me to have seabass instead. I got my Seabass but it was ok. My partner ordered lamb chop but he said that it was bit too burnt. We did enjoyed the starter of chicken wings and cocktails. Overall when I got the bill they charged me the price of Dover sole for the filet of Seabass and even without informing us.</body>

        <body>We had heard good things about Barbacoa and were looking forward to our evening However the whole experience was over priced and at best a mediocre night out The tables were crammed close together, it was badly and dimly lit and the music was intrusively loud   The servibg staff were attentive and courteous   Food was ok. Wine was very expensive and we were shocked to find our bill came to £170 for 2 people We eat out a lot and would have happily paid that for an outstanding experience It was by no means outstanding. We will not be going back.</body>

        <body>We were very impressed walking in to the restaurant to be met downstairs and shown up to the bar area as we were 15 minutes early for our reservation. We were very disappointed when half an hour later we were still not seated and found out our table had been given away to another couple. However they did eventually show us to a great table overlooking the cathedral. Food was really good, definitely reccomend the ribs! Very pricey so would definitely only come again for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>Four of us went on a Friday night. Those of us who turned up a little early for our 9pm seating were promptly seated and told not to worry about the time limitation mentioned in the booking.  We were to relax and enjoy, which we did in the large large leather seating.. Once everyone had arrived we were walked through the specials and the items unavailable. I made a special request on my ribs &quot;three ways&quot; as i dont eat beef. The gentleman serving us promptly found out if my request could be accommodated and, it could! i got extra pork belly instead of the beef jacobs ladder. WE continued to receive great service whilst we ate our amazing food. A really good night out with the lads with good cocktails, wine, whiskey and food! they even brought out a birthday macaroon for our buddy. Only reason I wouldnt give it a five is nothing is perfect and the bill at the end was a lot more than our drunk little brains had accounted for. Well worth it for a special treat, but we arent city bankers w</body>

        <body>My husband and I went for dinner on the 13th February. We were looking for something special and were certainly not disappointed!  As soon as we arrived we were taken in by the ambience - great location overlooking St. Paul&apos;s cathedral and gardens, great music, lighting and most of all style and setting of the restaurant, very &apos;New York&apos; Charcoal grill, with huge open barbecues smoking away in the kitchen with mouthwatering meats cooking away.  The food did not disappoint either. We decided to opt of &apos;nibbles&apos; to start as we wanted to tuck in to a good portion of meat for the main but there were some good starter options- there was nothing keeping us away from the olives on ice and light and fluffy pork cracklings!  Our waiter was absolutely fabulous also! Having not eaten much as Barbecue restaurants before, I leant on his advice as to what to have for main so fillet it was me and ribs three ways for hubby, all of which was a melt in the mouth sensation!   We got some sides of burnt </body>

        <body>I must admit we were expecting more. although the meat was juicy and well cooked, it lacked in deep flavour one would expect from top notch meat. Same applies to the side orders. great view. too loud although this is not a deciding factor for me.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been here 3 times now. First visit was outstanding, loved it and that&apos;s why I came again. The second time wasn&apos;t as great, food was standard and didn&apos;t knock my socks off like it did on the first visit. My third visit was 2 days ago and it was much the same as the second visit. Nothing that exciting about this place and the price isn&apos;t cheap for the quality in my opinion.  The drinks took a very long time to come, the food was cold within a short couple of minutes, the food itself was tasty but nothing spectacular.</body>

        <body>We ate at Barbecoa located at One New Change across from St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral. We sampled multiple entrees and starters - not a single one disappointed. The food was rediculously tasty, the service was exceptional, and the ambiance and view was nearly unmatchable. I will go back again and again when I am in London.</body>

        <body>It was not the romantic restaurant that I thought it would be. It was a very noisy restaurant. There was so much noise that our waitress had to bend over and talk to either me or my husband to make herself heard. It was not possible for her to stand up straight and talk to both of us. It was even difficult to make conversation just between the two of us. Restaurant is big en crowded. No romantic of festive dining. It is best to have a table with a view of the kitchen since it is too loud for a decent conversation. Food is good and tasty, but not spectacular. Too expensive for its value. Courses follow each other in rapid speed. They want you out in under 2 hours. Dinner at Barbecoa is not an evening long of food en dining. Waiters and waitresses are kind and helpful, but push for drinks. It was not the experience I hoped it would be. Alas.</body>

        <body>I enjoyed my meal at barbecue, but I felt there was something lacking and wouldn&apos;t go back... I felt the menu or staff didn&apos;t have enough explanation, so was unsure what to order. I felt the side dishes were very expensive, the red salad was bitter and not very exciting.  I would have had a 2nd glass of wine but didn&apos;t manage to get anyone&apos;s attention so didn&apos;t bother, we didn&apos;t bother with dessert either as it seemed like hard work..  The 12.5 service charge pushed the bill up and after I got home I realised we&apos;d been charged for an extra drink. We&apos;d been recommended to go there and it was a nice experience but I feel that there are better restaurants in London that are better value.</body>

We were then sat at a table overlooking St Paul&apos;s Cathedral. A stunning view!  To top it off there was a specially created plate for dessert with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate sauce.

        <body>as a group of friends we where so looking forward to the outstanding BBQ meat experience however maybe the PR has been used to leverage expections and I would have loved this energy to go into the food and intension to detail. Jamie&apos;s food is all about flavor that packs a punch so was expected (for the price) steak with incredible caramelisation plus some lemon, chili......something but I was just ok. The chips where not good which also can&apos;t be right however the beans and naan bread where outstanding. Best dish on the night was pulled beef. We agreed that we woul try again</body>

        <body>Great location, friendly and great service but to be honest, the price you pay is in no relation to the served meals. The filet steak is a filet steak, good quality but niothing special. For a piece of beef 32 british pounds without any sideorders is way too much. Ok it&apos;s jamie oliver maybe because of the name or because its london everything is over priced.  I have seen it but i would&apos;t recommend it, except money isn&apos;t a limiting factor.</body>

        <body>The service was brilliant - the staff are clearly well trained. The food was delicious and you could really taste the difference with the meat here and the way it is specially cooked. I asked for a table with a view of St Paul&apos;s Cathedral and the staff were so friendly and welcoming in offering us such a fabulous table. It was so refreshing to receive such friendly and attentive service when I was beginning to lose faith in some of London&apos;s restaurants. This place isn&apos;t cheap but it isn&apos;t ridiculously overpriced either. We were in a particularly lovely area of the restaurant and there is a busy buzz to the place which could perhaps go against a romantic evening - and this was on a Tuesday night - but top marks to this place.</body>

        <body>Four of us had lunch here on Sunday (10th May) and couldn&apos;t fault the service or food.  Unfortunately a couple of us ordered the Dover Sole and one the duck pate but the chef said that they were sub standard so wouldn&apos;t serve them which meant choosing different meals but it wasn&apos;t too much of a problem. Only drawback to lunchtime on Sunday is the restaurant was very very quiet which meant the ambiance wasn&apos;t as good as it probably is in the evening.  that said we all really enjoyed our meals, nothing was rushed and the waiting staff were very attentive.  Would definitely recommend and will be back.</body>

        <body>It was with great expectations we booked a table at Barbecoa for our weekend-trip to London. A London restaurant carrying the Jamie Oliver-brand was sure to be extraordinary.  BUT unfortunately we were hugely disappointed as it proved to less than ordinary and smelled more of a milking cow than an gourmet restaurant.  First of all, after walking through the extremely nice and scenic setting in the main restaurant, we ended up being seated in a kind of back-room, with no view and the lights so dim, we could hardly see the food on our plates. OK, it was a busy night and someone had to sit there - and it could just as well be us as it could be anyone else. So bad luck for us... And as it turned out, the lighting was our luck, because the food was arranged with absolutely now sense for food-for-the-eye.   But even that would have been ok, if the taste of the food we had just lived up the brand and price. However, the food was without flavour, to such an extent that we desperately tried to</body>

        <body>We found the quality of the food very average for the price you pay. The ambience is nice and the fact that it is in front of the St. Paul&apos;s Cathedrale is a plus. Nevetheless to much to pay for an average meal. I will not go there again. There are much better steal houses in London for the same cost.</body>

        <body>We ate at Barbecoa on a Friday evening, the restaurant was super busy but our waiter was attentive without being too pushy. We shared 2 starters between 3 of us which was more than enough. The mains were delicious, I had the double pork chop with a side of mash and the others had the Mexican Chicken with chip and the Pulled Pork - we all really enjoyed and the portion size was more than enough...we did have room for dessert - I&apos;d recommend going for their sweet treat platter..a few of their most popular desserts in smaller portions to share - we went for individuals and it was just a little too much.  All in all a lovely evening - forgot to mention, cocktails were delicious too!</body>

        <body>Bij binnenkomst kregen we een tafel in een hoek naast een gordijn bij de ingang. Een paar tafels van ons verwijderd zat een man die behoorlijk dronken was en voor overlast zorgde. Het duurde nogal enige tijd voor het personeel deze man uit het restaurant verwijderde en dit ging gepaard met veel kabaal en geschreeuw. (fuck you etc.) Er werd door het personeel wat lacherig over gedaan en er werden geen excuses gemaakt naar de gasten. Het voorgerecht was goed, echter de hoofdgerechten waren slecht, de ribjes waren erg vet en smaakloos, de garnalen was erg weinig en ook smaakloos. De rekening echter was voor hetgeen is gepresenteerd buiten alle proporties, samengevat een waardeloze avond met slecht eten en slechte ambians.</body>

        <body>Considering the price, the sirloin steak was a really poor cut. Very sinewy and part of it were inedible. The burger was not worth £26, and to have to pay for sides on top of every main meal meant the price really ramped up.</body>

        <body>This was our second visit to Barbecoa although have visited a couple of other of Jamie&apos;s restaurants and enjoyed all. This one more upmarket and expensive.  Great staff who are all very friendly and seem genuinely quite thrilled to know you have enjoyed each dish and your overall visit. They are an asset.  We enjoyed all our food, great combinations of flavours and beef and lamb dishes excellent, tender, full of flavour and not smothered in sauces.  Malbec wine, although at cheaper end of those on offer, was superb. Really recommend.  One member of party thought prices were a bit too high for what offered and felt a bit rushed but no criticism of food otherwise.  Surroundings and views looking onto St Paul&apos;s Cathedral were amazing. A great meal.</body>

        <body>The waitress at our table and the maître-de worked very hard to impress, knowing full well that the quality of food and our dining experience was below Barbecoa&apos;s standards.   Saturday was manic. Staff were running around like headless chickens. From the intro to table, drinks ordered at bar not arriving, chewy calamari starter,  to our undercooked main steak meals, then re-cooked and still not edible, plus ribs (starter and main) were dry and tasted like they were a day old and warmed in microwave. One positive from four mains was the excellent Dover sole. For the price paid for drinks I expect anything from the fridge to be cold, not tepid, i.e. Champagne. Things just continued to go wrong.   I recommended to met friends, who&apos;d travelled into London for the evening, on Saturday night at Barbecoa as I had enjoyed a fabulous experience on a Tuesday evening in December 2014.   We will not be back and we will not recommend.</body>

        <body>Not as good as it used to be. The crab starter I had had so little crab on it, it could only be described as a taster. The trio of ribs were Ok except one was luke warm. The best part was dessert - the sticky toffee pudding. Service was poor and orders for drinks were taken after the food order had been given.  View was great but overall experience was disappointing.</body>

        <body>My other half and I had a dinner reservation at 8.15. We arrived at 8.10 and were told our table wasn&apos;t ready so could we have a seat at the bar. As we were 5 minutes early we thought little of it. The staff were plentiful and all had head sets on so I was under the impression they knew which diners were where and that we would be informed as soon as our table was ready. How very wrong I was!  25 minutes later (and seeing other diners coming in after us and being shown to their tables) I went and asked a waitress when our table would be ready? 5 minutes I was told.  Ten minutes passed and my partner and I decided that a half hour wait for a table was completely unacceptable - we paid for our drinks and left. As we were getting ready to leave we were told our table was now ready but to be honest we didn&apos;t want to spend any more money in a place that kept you waiting that long.  We were very disappointed and would expect much more from a high-end restaurant.   After leaving Barbecoa we </body>

        <body>I have been to Barbecoa before and enjoyed it. This time they were very busy and we were stuck away in a far corner with no view or atmosphere and I roughly measured it, 9 inches from the next couple. It is not cheap so everything has to be right and on this occasion it really wasn&apos;t. I wouldn&apos;t go there again - the prices have gone up, too many people crammed in. Disappointing.</body>

        <body>Been to Barbecoa before and loved it, everything was perfect and as requested. this time was slightly different, the portion size was alot smaller which is ok by me but perhaps not others as lets not forget its very expensive. Meat was ordered to be well done and specifically asked for no blood, no red atall and it came with blood on plate as i cut into it. This nearly made me head straight for the door I was so put off. They took it back without hesitation and were very good about the misunderstanding but when it came back it was still quite red in the middle which i couldn&apos;t eat, so i find myself in expensive restaurant, cutting round the outside of my food - unimpressed. Last time same request was made and it was perfect. I guess its all down to the chefs at the end of the day but i didn&apos;t love it.. Other parts of meal were great tho. Beautiful view of st pauls, good ambiance and service, if a little rushed. If you can&apos;t eat rare meat, order something else or go somewhere else, its</body>

        <body>I booked online from Munich, Germany with a question about the butchered meat because of histamine disorder in our party.  1: Barbacoa called me in  Germany to answer my question!  2: Upon being handed the menus, the waiter pointed out which things on the menu had been discussed over this telephone discussion! A very special service that one doesn&apos;t get in many places! I personally didn&apos;t like the &apos;garden salad&apos; of garden roots not leaves. I do not recommend having an important discussion while there. It is a bustling place. The grill was very good! Expensive as London goes..........</body>

        <body>For a place that does steak, it must really learn how to cook steak. We ordered a steak for two, on the bone, which admittedly is hard to cook. However, it arrived burnt on the outside, and also overcooked on the inside. We complained, they took it away, and gave us a sirloin for one to replace the rib eye for two that we ordered. No discount. Not happy.  This is the second time there and on the previous visit, they undercooked the steak - it was so rare that my sister could not eat huge chunks in the middle because she does not eat red, bleeding meat. Twice now, and they still can&apos;t impress me. Will not be returning - despite the friendly waiters and good starters.</body>

        <body>A busy Saturday evening, service was excellent.  We were wedged into the furthest corner with a view of the shopping mall, not St Paul&apos;s. The Pig Cheeks were delicious. The (huge) sirloin was ok - asked for med-rare, the middle third was almost blue. Mexican chicken was very nice but too big to finish! £140 for 2 with a bottle of prosecco is usual for the area but we would&apos;ve been happier with a better table.   Typical aesthetic attention to detail that you would expect from Jamie Oliver. However, if you ignore the fixtures, fittings and tableware, you can find just-as-good steak anywhere else in Central London.</body>

Everyone enjoyed the whole experience and although it was an expensive evening we new it would be but it was a special event.  I asked for the house red which was a great drink and OK price.</body>

        <body>The food was delicious. I&apos;ve had better, but it was certainly very good. The calamari, chicken wings, mushrooms and ribeye were all beautiful. Both the bourbon &amp; peppercorn sauce and the mayonnaise were quite bland, though, and the chips were a little undercooked. We had a cocktail each, my wife had a glass of wine and I had a beer. The drinks were all excellent.  Despite telling them my wife&apos;s name twice, once in writing and once over the phone (where I spelled it out), they still managed to spell her name wrong on the birthday dessert plate. (Her name is only three letters, so it ought not to have been too hard.) That was a little disappointing, but we laughed it off.  All told, it came to around £180, which is a lot, however you look at it. Too much. It felt very overpriced for what we had. I enjoyed it, but I probably wouldn&apos;t go back.</body>

        <body>This is not my first visit to Barbacoa but it it the first I have not enjoyed. Since my last visit B has decided it will is ring you to confirm the booking and if you do not pick up, will ask you to ring them back. I made my booking by email, so much easier. I do not want to be spending time ringing and confirming details and a date I have already committed to. A waste of my time.   We were  25 mins early for a 7.00 booking and my party of four was told quite clearly that if we went straight to the table our 2 hour slot would start immediately. The impression being our early arrival was some sort of sneaky attempt to gain more table time!  Something that would not above applied apparently if we went to the bar for the interim period.   Those of you who know B will be aware that they have an area surrounded on three sides by walls with no view of St Paul&apos;s of London. Despite the booking and confirmation and early arrival and giving an assurance we would not stay beyond our allotted tim</body>

        <body>The fact that my very first experience of a Jamie Oliver restaurant was Barbecoa was because we could not get reservations at any other Jamie restaurant. I was ready for a meat-intensive dining experience with little touches of &quot;Jamie&quot; but my fellow-diners were not. I, therefore chose judiciously: the lamb chops with Indian spices (vindaloo) seemed just right and it was excellent! My fellow dinners chose the rump steak and the double pork chop respectively. While their meats were excellent, the accompaniments were not really sides but little dashes of flavour -- they were not-so-satisfied!  For the diner from the US, a warning is in order: do order side dishes because the main is just the meat as the centrepiece, no carbohydrates or greens to balance the platter. (The lamb chops were the exception.) A final word on the view: the restaurant is glass-fronted and the view of St Paul&apos;s is stunning! It stares at you up close and feels so magical against the night sky.</body>

        <body>They gave us a lovely table with an amazing view of St Pauls. The initial service on entry was faultless, we were attended to straight away, and they were very welcoming,  as the meal went on, they were a little bit lax with topping up our wine, with us looking around for our waiter to make eye contact. The chicken wings are the best chicken wings I have ever eaten, and the crab was also beautiful just the portion of crab itself was very small. We had the ribs and steak for mains, ribs were lovely but a little fatty..The steak was amazing and cooked to perfection. A bit of a wait between our main dishes being cleared and getting a dessert menu, again involved some looking around to get eye contact..but the dessert didn&apos;t disappoint. Overall it was a lovely night and to be fair I must note that the restaurant was very very busy. They were also kind enough to charge my phone.</body>

        <body>Having eaten here last year and having enjoyed it very much I thought barbecoa would be a great place for my husbands birthday. Disappointing. The food was good but several aspects of the service were not good at all. With few exceptions wherever we go to eat we would normally have a drinks order taken whilst we look at the menu, at barbecoa we had our food order taken and then had to ask if we could order drinks. We had to prompt drinks orders throughout our meal, the waiter was not forthcoming, at £7.50 per bottle of beer and £11.00 plus for cocktails I would thing they would be keener to encourage drink sales and I would expect better. We asked if there was a children&apos;s menu, we were given two uninspired options, fair enough this is not a family restaurant as such. We ordered for our daughter, no food for her with our starter or with our main course, we chased it up to be told her food had not been ordered, the waiter said he thought we were only asking for children&apos;s options out o</body>

        <body>Premium quality food, served beautifully but still remaining true to Jamie Oliver&apos;s core. We had the pork cheek and smoked duck to start, followed by the t-bone for two - both top-notch. Shared the dessert sharing platter to finish off. Liked that we could buy a carafe of wine instead of a whole bottle.</body>

        <body>Service was undoubtably good. From the moment we stepped through the doors we greeted, coats taken and they radioed ahead so someone else took us to our table as we got to the top of the stairs. Had the crab cocktail as a starter and for the most expensive starter was not really that much better that you could make at home. My sirloin was cooked well, a little lacking in sauce, and good but maybe not mind blowing as you may expect from a specialist meat restaurant. The ribs and pork belly were underwhelming in flavour and a bit dry. We had the desert board that sampled all the individual deserts, of which I think one or two were decent. Water, 1 Starter, 2 mains,  1 desert board, prosecco bottle was around £160.</body>

        <body>First: the food is spectacular. Second: The service is fantastic. I love American BBQ food, and I&apos;ve been a regular at Barbecoa since around 2011. As a BBQ fan, I try to explore as many venues as I can. Barbecoa is definitely at the top of my list for taste. It falls when it comes to price, although this is easily justifiable by framing Barbecoa less as a regular BBQ joint, and more as fine dining, with a BBQ theme, in a prime location. The downside to my experience yesterday was that the Calamari was slightly overdone, but that&apos;s easily done, and easily forgiven. Try Barbecoa - you won&apos;t regret it!</body>

        <body>This is a very busy restaurant so I feel the service is a bit slow. They also cocked up the order and the stake were overlooked. Great views and very popular but has a major design fault, as when sunny the sunlight reflects of a  glass rain canopy and blinds you if you are facing it.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been half a dozen times and would go more if I were tee-total. Unfortunately the wine list is pitched about two notches higher than the food prices (as are the cocktails). So do go for the splendid meat, but unless you are feeling flush, wait until you are on the wagon....</body>

        <body>I went with my family visiting from Australia. I requested a table with a St Paul&apos;s view &amp; was not disappointed! We had a mixture of ribs &amp; crab to start, all of which were beautifully cooked &amp; presented. We all had steaks for main, again cooked as requested &amp; very delicious. Cocktails were excellent &amp; a wonderful selection of wines available. Very polite &amp; attentive staff. Overall a fantastic dinning experience</body>

        <body>Service was excellent. Our waiter was always smiling and had great interpersonal skills. Food was tasty and the steaks were very generous portion size. Wine hugely overpriced. Be prepared to spend £100 per head for a 3 course meal with wine. Not for everyday eating.</body>

        <body>Arrived at Barbecoa and was greeted warmly by the staff who took our coats and ushered us to our table. Stylish and beautifully decorated restaurant. The waitress (didnt get her name unfortunately) was brilliant, smiley, helpful and fun, just what you want to add to the experience. We made our order and food arrived within 10 minutes. Incredible wine - £26 per caraffe however. Calamari was not the best but the duck pate was delicious. The heroes were the steaks, probably the best steak i&apos;ve ever eaten and those chips, wow!! And I&apos;ve eaten some amazing steaks. Great place, great food and great service. Cant ask for more when spending £150 on a meal, but worth every penny in this case. My only gripe was that the tables are so close together, it didnt feel like a romantic meal for two, it felt like there were two other couples sitting with us. :( One too many tables in my opinion.</body>

        <body>+ve: Rib-eye + chateaubriand were of good size and well cooked.  Attentive service -ve: Beans tasted of bbq sauce not a hint of the smoky meatiness promised from the burnt ends Ribs were either too salty, tiny Jacobs ladder or badly basted. Broccoli were just steamed broccoli no hint of lime or chilli chips were decent, but not as special as you would hope for such a venue  For what you pay you expect food of high quality unfortunately even the chateaubriand and rib-eye although good can be found elsewhere (Criterion/ Hawksmoor/ Sophies) where they are equally as good, if not better.  The waiters were very accommodating, if a bit slow with the drinks, but there did look to be a very small bar area for the entire place so hardly their fault. We were initially sat next to a table full of city boys guffawing at each others jokes. After mentioning this they quickly found us a table closer to the magnificent window and the view of St Pauls.</body>

        <body>Second time at Barbrcoa and this time for client entertaining. Food was good, although not as good as I had remembered. For a barbecue restaurant, I expected to see many options of barbecued meat, but the dishes were pre-conceived with set weights / cuts. This was not a major issue, but one of the steaks cooked medium-well, when asked for medium-rare was a surprise  Ambience and feel of the restaurant was very good, as you expect from a JO. Bill was more expensive than I had expected, so can&apos;t score high on Value  Overall, was a good place for the purpose</body>

        <body>We went for a Valentine&apos;s meal and as expected the place was very busy. However we still managed to have a very personal and private experience, there were lots of staff on hand who were very attentive, and the food was excellent.  Need to be prepared to pay a little more than usual for the experience, but still worth every penny. Will be going back to try the Sunday lunch menu.</body>

        <body>Nice location with a selection of different environments within the restaurant. Great views of St Paul&apos;s. Very happy with the choice of food and drinks. Really is a hearty menu. Service started off well but towards the end of the meal we were left for long periods looking for service, not what we expected. We ended up skipping desert as we were so frustrated by the end of the evening.</body>

        <body>We are relatively new to London and I read about this restaurant on Time Out and instantly jumped on it as it boasted incredible views of St Pauls. There definitely was an absolutely stunning view however sadly only a very small part of the restaurant gets to enjoy this. We were placed on a small table right by the kitchen and literally back to back with another diner which I was slightly disappointed about, but understand this is to some extent the luck of the draw!My partner&apos;s main also came out a fair while before mine did. I really can&apos;t fault the food though, it was beautifully cooked and both main dishes we ordered had incredible flavour. The dessert menu was also beautiful and we couldn&apos;t decide so went with the dessert platter and sampled mini versions of all of them - they were all gorgeous but I especially loved the white chocolate cheese cake - hands down the lightest cheesecake I&apos;ve ever had. The drinks menu was equally impressive and we really enjoyed the cocktails we ord</body>

        <body>We went there for a special occasion.  I had asked for I seat with a view which  they gave me overlooking St. Paul&apos;s&apos; cathedral.   The surroundings were modern and comfortable.  We had already decided to have the lunch set menu before we entered the restaurant.  It was three courses for 26 pounds.  We thought that it was reasonable vale for money although the choice was limited.  We had ribs to start which were ok with a nice garnish, but we really enjoyed the rump steak.  The dessert we wanted had sold out so we were given the choice of any dessert on the menu, which was great.  We had sticky toffee pudding and pana cotta, again delicious.                     Throughout the meal the staff were very attentive.  In conclusion a lovely experience which we would repeat</body>

        <body>Our table was so close to the couples on either side of us that we were closer to them than to each other. Having a conversation was quite difficult as you couldn&apos;t hear much.   The views are not as expected as you are only on the 1st floor.   The decor is very nice and the food was good. One of our steaks was overcooked and replaced straight away so the service was great. I would say it is not worth the money though as I have eaten much better steak at Hawksmoor and Cau.</body>

        <body>On Monday, 20 April 2015, my partner and I attended a celebratory dinner at Barbecoa. The restaurant had been informed that it was my partners birthday and I had requested that the table be ready for 20:00. I was emailed a confirmation that informed me that the table would only be available for 2 hours.   Upon arrival, we were told that the table was not ready and we would have to wait in the bar, no apology. We were escorted to the extremely full bar and simply left to our own devices. There was nowhere to sit and we weren&apos;t even offered a drinks menu. The lone barman did not even acknowledge us for a full 15 minutes. When we eventually got his attention and asked for a menu, the lighting was so poor it was very difficult to read.   We placed an order for some of the &quot;Nibbles&quot; which was Sour Dough Bread with Chicken butter while we reviewed the menu. We then ordered our self-chosen wine and some starters, which were recommended by our waitress - baby back ribs and Tandoori Prawns. Th</body>

        <body>The location is very nice. The beautiful view with St. Paul&apos;s just nearby is stunning. The open kitchen with the grill and meat displayed lets your hunger grow. The staff was extremely friendly and helpfull and we felt very welcome. The food was good but not outstanding. We missed the dressing on the side salad and eventhough the waitress told us she will fetch some more, it never arrived at our table. The one really negative point was the noise. It&apos;s really loud and even being just a party of two, talking together was very difficult because you could hardly hear each other at a normal speach volume. It was a relief leaving the restaurant towards the much quieter street. The prices are rather high for what you get. I&apos;m Swiss and used to expensive food, but I thought it was a bit too much.</body>

        <body>For the price I would have expected much better, the bbq ribs were ok nothing special a bit dry to be honest. The beef ones were better marinated then the pork.  However the chicken wings were quite nice.  Although wheel chair accessible they have such big bases on the table you can&apos;t put the wheel chair in and have to eat at an angle. And no other options available there.  The sticky toffee pudding was alright though very small amount of ice cream with it.

        <body>Unfortunately we were seated next to the door and had to move as it was too cold. I booked 3 months in advance and wasn&apos;t given a good spot in the restaurant. My wife&apos;s dish, Dover sole was uncooked when it came to the table as confirmed by the manager. The second was overcooked to compensate.  When the final bill came, they had taken off the cost of two sweets to compensate for the main course! I commentated that there was nothing thing wrong with the sweets so why had they done this. They then removed the cost of the main course.  A service charge of 12.5% had been added and I asked for this to be reduced as I felt it was not warranted.  I will not be going back and would not recommend it to anyone. Disappointing!!</body>

        <body>When booked asked for a table overlooking St Paul&apos;s, when we arrived, said a table wasn&apos;t available, which was fine, but put us right at the very back of the restaurant, was very impressed with that. Service was good, meal was o.k, but very expensive</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been here a few times now and it never disappoints. Service is without exception friendly and attentive (but not fussy). There is a decent cocktail list and area to have a drink before going to your table. The menu is full of great flavours and food combinations and the standard of cooking really is top notch. Extensive wine list compliments the whole evening and thoroughly recommend Barbecoa.</body>

        <body>We ordered a nice old bottle of wine, which really could have done with breathing or decanting, but they only brought it after our food came, so didn&apos;t quite live up to its potential. Service was quite slow and inattentive overall  Food other wise was fantastic, and their boubon selection is amazing.</body>

        <body>Had lunch here on Monday - the food was excellent. Service a little slow (perhaps to encourage more drinking) but the quality of the food really made up for any lack of attentiveness as it was to-die-for. I had the rump steak with smoked aubergine and I would eat it again right now! The host on reception was a little surly but the waiters and staff inside the restaurant were perfectly friendly (when they came over to the table). Overall a very good experience and I&apos;ll definitely dine here again.</body>

        <body>I took my partner to Barbecoa for a surprise birthday lunch. Even though I expected the food to be fabulous, I cannot begin to describe how fantastic it really was, we both agreed this was without a doubt the best steak either of us had ever had. My only disappointment was that we were too full to sample the desserts but at least that gives us an excuse to come back. The staff are knowledgeable and welcoming and overall this was just a fantastic start to a birthday weekend.</body>

        <body>...when the sun came down I was blinded by sun for at least 30 minutes and there were no blinds. A small niggle when balanced by the excellent service and absolutely delicious food.  I ate the pit beef, my partner had the ribs 3 ways with chips and baked beans on the side. The pit beef put me in mind of the opening credits of The Flintstones where Fred&apos;s food made his car tip over. It was HUGE. The ribs were well cooked, well smoked and really tasty.  I will definitely be coming back to try the steaks.</body>

        <body>Our starters were fantastic but our main was very poor, the short ribs were overcooked and dry, to be fair to the restaurant they did agree and took the price of the dish off our bill but we were disappointed.  The wine seemed very expensive for what you got and overall the restaurant was very loud with tables very close together.  Overall a disappointing evening, we expected much more.</body>

        <body>We consisted of a group of 5 businessmen and were given a table in the corner. This worked against us as we frequently had to try and grab the attention of the staff for service. The food was good, personally I skipped the starter as although there was a choice it didn&apos;t have anything that was within my taste range. The steaks were good as were the desserts. If the service had been better it would have been a good choice.</body>

We had a wonderful three course meal, where the highlight was the fantastic cooked chateaubriand.

        <body>We loved the food, it was amazing, some of the best steak I&apos;ve ever had. The drinks menu was also top notch and we enjoyed a cocktail followed by a delicious wine choice. Our waiter and all of the staff who served us were a delight: friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable and they never left us needing anything, always very quick to fill out glass and clear our plates. The atmosphere of the restaurant manages to stay very relaxed but is a stunning back drop with great views of London with St.Pauls just outside the window. I went with a friend but would also be perfect for a date or for a special occasion. I would really recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>Was not outstanding as I had expected it to be.  Wine by the glass was very good - Pinot noir and a very good malbec. filet lacked flavour and was slighting more than medium rare for me.  if I go again, would ask for a juicy, bloody medium rare.   chips were a rather woody and dry and again pretty flavourless.   staff were attentive and cheerful.   receptionist did not acknowledge our arrival until he was off the phone. I simple smile and hand up would have been nice. bit officious and off hand.</body>

        <body>This was my second visit and it really didn&apos;t disappoint. Great food and the views are spectacular.   If you want to have the best food of its kind this is the place to you. You cannot get meat like this anywhere else. And there are alternatives on the menu if you are not a great meat eater, but try it and be surprised. It isn&apos;t like the quality of anything you can buy or cook yourself.  The view is amazing. Sitting looking at St Pauls in the greatest city in the world, and from where you are there is access to great shopping, the South Bank and the Thames, and some of the best parts of the city.  Service is also great. Very friendly and helpful and new the menu well.  I couldn&apos;t recommend this place more.</body>

        <body>Me and my husband went to Barbecoa for Valentine&apos;s dinner. I ordered the sirloin - which was really good - and my husband had the T-bone steak -which wasn&apos;t any good at all but rather tough and wiry.   We also had the specials dessert: a chocolate fondant w/vanilla ice cream to share, which was delicious!  The view, atmosphere and service at Barbecoa is fantastic.  All in all this was a good (but rather costly) experience.</body>

        <body>Really enjoyed our dinner here last Friday. Was a very busy Friday nifghy and restaurant was full but still an enjoyable noise level. Our food was mixed - starters were ok (calamari was cold and they messed up our order by bringing a main instead of the starter so we had to wait a long time) Main were great - the ribs were beautiful and served with a side of creamy mash - ideal! My partners pulled beef was nice but probably not worth the price tag. Couldn&apos;t manage a dessert but they looked amazing! There was also a problem with our bill - we were almost charged double for a lot of what we ordered - no real explanation given and not sure how they could have gotten it wrong. Watch out for this as partner almost paid without checking the bill until he realised it seemed a bit steep....  Overall very nice restaurant and meal but a few disappointments that you wouldn&apos;t wpect from such a high end place.</body>

        <body>I have a been a few times and think its a good venue with excellent views of at Paul&apos;s.. Food was very good but thought it was overpriced. Service was ok, would go again I&apos;m sure but there are other places that would be higher on my list to revisit.</body>

        <body>The range of choices and design of dishes on the menu is generally good. The food well prepared and appetising.However, the enjoyment of the occasion is greatly undermined by the noise level throughout the restaurant and the over&apos;attentive&apos; intrusion of serving staff,who were either too quick to e.g. refill glasses and whisk away plates which were barely finished or were gossiping between themselves in full view of the clientele but nevertheless unresponsive to being hailed when really wanted.. The excessive noise was due to the combination of echoing conversations and back-ground music volume far too high. The overall impression being to provoke a quick turnround of covers .</body>

        <body>2 people in the party ordered the lamb chops and when they arrived, the chops were extermely fatty, in fact 85% of the plate was bones and fat, with very little meat and pretty disappointing considering the price tag attached to the dish. However another member of the party ordered the steak and this was an excellent cut of meat with great flavours. So i guess i chose the wrong option. Service was great and very attentive, nothing was too much trouble. I would go again but would pick something different from the menu.</body>

        <body>The food was excellent (especially the bbq ribs appetiser and the chateaubriand with truffle butter!!) and the service  was also great.  I also requested ahead that we get a table with a good view, as we had overseas visitors, and the restaurant very kindly obliged with a table by the window overlooking the dome of St Paul&apos;s Cathedral.  A great night overall.  Thank you very much Barbecoa.</body>

        <body>As present to my sister-in-law we chose Barbecoa for lunch &amp; it turned out to be a great decision. The staff were friendly, very well informed on the food &amp; drink menu. Attentive without being intrusive. The pricing was also a pleasant surprise &amp; we did not hold back!  I would return any time &amp; maybe we can push the boat out for dinner on the next occasion.</body>

        <body>I frequently use Barbecoa to entertain friends/guests.  It has never failed to deliver and surpass expectation.  The ambience and outlook on St Paul&apos;s are fantastic - never fails to impress.  I regards the beef as second to none in London.  We had the Chateaubriand for 2 - it was cooked to perfection and melt in the mouth.  Service and contact with all staff was delightful.  I look forward to my next visit already!</body>

        <body>My ribs were delicious and my companion was very complimentary about their pork chop - the portions were very generous as you would expect of such a meat-orientated establishment (though there wee a lot of seafood dishes on the menu).   The cocktails started at about £8 but most were £10. Service was very efficient, we didn&apos;t have to wait very long for anything but then we went early, sitting down at 6.30 p.m.  The restaurant is a big, roomy space decorated in a modern, male style - dark, very &apos;City&apos;.  The tables are a nice size and reasonably spaced.  We found it a little noisy but not ridiculously so but we were on the edge of the floor.   I had a main course, a non-alcoholic cocktail at £5, coffee and water and my share of the bill was about £43. Very happy to go again, especially for an early dinner.</body>

        <body>Booked for my husbands birthday and so glad i did. Our view of st Pauls really topped off a fantastic lunch. We took our 10 month old son, who fell asleep just before desert and the waiting staff were so helpful getting the pram and asking if they could assist. The food was beautiful, my husband said it was the best steak he had ever eaten, and i must agree, it was cooked to prefection and the spinach was so tasty. We have already recommended this resturant to my family who work in London and friends who will be visiting London soon. On our next trip to London we will be booking again.  The service was excellent, very atentive but not over the top and we were left to enjoy our meal.</body>

        <body>We had the ribeye for two - best steak we&apos;ve had in years, and we know our steak! The smoked aubergine was sublime - it was meant to accompany the rump steak, but we were allowed to order it as a side with our ribeye. The charming wait staff had the right mix of professionalism and friendliness. Stylish and comfy 1950s-style banquette seating compliments the wonderful fare.</body>

        <body>A little hard to find, we arrived early and they changed our booking, it wasn&apos;t overly busy .  The table we got was lovely .  We had a nice view.  The server was lovely and recommended they could make a menu for my daughter if she wasn&apos;t a big eater.  Which I though was lovely.  She had fillet steak rare and loved it.  She said it was her best meal .  Trust me this kids eats  in lots of restaurants and will state her mind still giving out about Scott&apos;s in May fair and the sea bass.  I had the squid .  To be fair had a lot better meant to be chilly !! Try banjos in Channel Islands for squid with chilly.   I had the cheese board it was fab.  I would come back.  Did enjoy the experience.   Steak and chips 40 pounds a little pricey .  We are use to paying around 25 in channel Islands.</body>

        <body>Food was good but had unfortunately the impression that  it was a matter of getting guests in and out  to quickly. Not enough time in between starters - mains. Nice view to Sct Pauls but very noisy setting  due to  far too many guests in restaurant. Ambience therefore not the best. Too expensive for the value of money and not quite the  experience we had hoped for.</body>

        <body>I don&apos;t normally write reviews - I often intend to but never get around to it - but on this occasion I have to leave a review given the wonderful service we received at Barbecoa. My other half and I had an amazing dinner here on a Friday night, celebrating our anniversary. When I initially booking, I had asked if it would be possible to have a &apos;nice&apos; table given we were celebrating, and they certainly didn&apos;t disappoint. We had a beautiful view of St Paul&apos;s in a very comfortable and spacious banquette seated table. The food was delicious, I went for the calamari starter which came with a fab red pepper and chilli sauce followed by the sirloin which was perfectly cooked. My partner went for the ribs followed by the slow roast pit beef which looked so soft and succulent and he thoroughly enjoyed. But in some ways more than the food, we enjoyed some of the best service that I have experienced in a while from Louise, our server for the night. Louise managed to balance the fine line between</body>

        <body>Overall, the food was really, really good. But paying 40 euros for a piece of meat without any potatoes, chips,  vegetables seems insane but the amazing tastes makes it worth it. What really put me off however, is the audacity to ask for a 12,5% service charge. With prices that high for the food, a 12,5% service charge gets up to 30-40 quid easily. That, for bringing three dishes made my visit to barbecoa less pleasent than it could have been.  When i tried to pay by card, they included the service charge, while other restaurants ask you if they can include it.... at barbecoa they didn&apos;t  In terms of atmosphere, i would say the restaurant is really noisy so I do not recommend it for private parties.  In short: Food&apos;s worth it, but ditch the service charge. I want to give a service fee, but not 40 quid. Compliments to the chef nonetheless.</body>

        <body>Had a wonderful dining experience at Barbecoa last Sunday. Could not fault the place in terms of the ambience or the food. Food was well presented and tasty and definitely will leave you feeling full and satisfied. Staff were very on the ball and efficient. The view from the restaurant was amazing too and just an overall lovely feed. Make sure your wallet&apos;s full though. £7 for a side of mushrooms with your in excess of £30 steak was a bit steep but again if it&apos;s a one off, special occasion it can be justified.</body>

        <body>On arrival at the restaurant we checked in as it were and headed upstairs to the restaurant.  We were half way up the stairs when the receptionist called out &apos;stop - you can&apos;t go there as there is no-one to show you to your table!&apos;  - we literally had feet on different steps and had to wait there until someone could show us to our table.   Not a great start.  My guest and I both had steak (I opted for fillet steak - guest had sirlon steak).  We both asked for medium rare.   Seeing as this is specifically a meat restaurant, and with the Jamie Oliver name, we were looking forward to a wonderful meal.  Starters of pigs cheeks and crab were ok.  The steak was a different story.    The fact that both steaks were medium to well done and massively overcooked was the least of the problems.   The meat was of terrible quality - so much so that I am not 100% sure that mine was not fillet steak.     I hacked my way through the worst quality meat I have had in a long time.   When we mentioned the </body>

        <body>This restaurant is just amazing. We had to wait about 30mins for table but we had drink in the bar so time went quick and we understand because ithe restaurant was fully booked. Staff fantastic,friendly and helpful and atmosphere was really good. We get table by the window with amazing view to St. Paul&apos;s. Food and wine was perfect. I would recommend to everyone :)</body>

        <body>All the main courses were good - we all had steak of some description - however my tandoori prawn starter was tiny - only 3 small prawns - and tasted too smoky for my liking. The resturant was very busy but had no real atmosphere. If you were on the side where you could see St Paul&apos;s the views were amazing - otherwise you were very aware that you were in a shopping centre.</body>

        <body>After seeing John Relihan at a cookery event last year in Dublin we wanted to go to Barbecoa the next time we were in London. It was definitely worth the trip as the steaks are really special here. I had the 8oz fillet steak and it was perfect. The service was excellent and there is a nice casual atmosphere in the restaurant. There are also great views of St. Paul&apos;s cathedral. I would definitely return to the restaurant the next time I&apos;m in London.</body>

        <body>The service and food were both spectacular. Very attentive and helpful wait staff, without being too intrusive. Lovely cocktail to start served in a cute milk bottle. Delicious steak for main. Would recommend. Also great atmosphere and view of St Paul&apos;s. Expensive but worth it for a special occasion or just a great quality dinner. Would love to go back and try a dessert as well!</body>

        <body>We were early so had a couple of drinks at the bar, then moved to a table for two at the window with St Paul&apos;s right next to us.     We really enjoyed the food and will be back to try something different from the menu next time.  Can highly recommend this restaurant setting, atmosphere and food are fantastic.  Service from reception to bar to waiters all very professional and friendly.</body>

        <body>The setting, with St Pauls Cathedral as a back drop, is first rate. The ambience and decor is attractive, but the food and service does not deliver to expectation. Barbecoa follows the Jamie&apos;s Italian formula with much higher prices and without any improved quality. For that reason, we were rather disappointed.</body>

        <body>Fabulous location looking out towards St Pauls.......restaurant really vibrant and lively in atmosphere. The food is a meat-lovers delight.....didn&apos;t notice vegetarian options but they must have been there. Corn bread is a MUST TRY. Beautifully presented food.....huge portions! Dessert excellent too. Loved it!</body>

        <body>My wife and I took our son there for a midweek birthday dinner. The first thing to say is that anywhere that looks out to St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral gets a big tick in my book. the second is that, if you hadn&apos;t already worked it out, this restaurant is all about meat. The decor is industrial. The service was good. Our seafood starters were definitely on the small side but the meaty mains were just that, meaty. The steak and ribs were delicious.  At about £70 per head including wine, it&apos;s not cheap but that was to be expected given the location.</body>

        <body>My husband and I had a gorgeous meal here on sat 4th April.  The steak was delicious as was the sharing desert board.  We loved it. Prices seemed reasonable for the high standard, only thing on a slight down side is that I thought the wine selection was very expensive.  Great service and the staff are very friendly.  Thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.</body>

        <body>Arriving at an empty restaurant around 12pm, the service was phenomenal, the food was superb, but as the place filled out, the service went South very quickly.  We had our young son with us so had to skip dessert due to time and patience levels and wanted to pack his food back. Unfortunately they threw it away instead, so we spent a further 40 minutes while they tried to locate it/recook it.  By 1pm the service staff were inattentive to the point of being rude, but will remember the place for the food and ambience over the service.</body>

        <body>We had great expectations, but the food was cold when it arrived- we sent back both the vegetables and the meat.  The tpas at the beginning were ordinary and &apos;fluff&apos;.  We would have had a better meal at half the price if we had stayed in our own home town and eat at one of the restaurants we typically frequent.  We will be reluctant to book a meal in the future with a restaurant just because of a celebrity name.</body>

        <body>Jamie Oliver&apos;s venture into the premium steak market. Noisy and crowded, and staff a little too keen to cycle the tables. Prices are at the top end of the spectrum (e.g. rib eye for two, £70 - and that&apos;s without any sides at all, which are ca. £5 each). Much of your money is going on the decor and the unparalleled view of St Paul&apos;s cathedral in the background. The food was pretty good quality and nicely presented although my medium rare ribeye was virtually raw on the inside. Waiters had a lot of trouble getting nibbles, starters, and sides correct - what came was essentially random - and several items we hadn&apos;t ordered appeared on the bill and had to be wrangled over. I don&apos;t like places where the wine bottles are whisked away from you and kept somewhere else - you spend half the night trying to flag a waiter down to refill your glass. I did enjoy the evening but I don&apos;t feel compelled to return. Apart from the spectacular views, other places do roughly the same sort of thing better.</body>

        <body>If you love meat then you&apos;ll love Barbecoa. Classy space, great service, stunning wine list and food that makes you pause and make a Homer drool face... It ain&apos;t cheap but it&apos;s worth it. If you can get a window seat in the shadow of St Pauls it&apos;ll impress your date or if you&apos;re a suit your business colleagues. Just make sure you go with an empty stomach...</body>

        <body>Great service and the fact my sirloin steak was horribly over cooked was dealt with efficiently...the free dessert was a nice touch. Wine list is extensive but a bit overpriced.  Ribs were nice but not stand out I&apos;d not return or recommend though as there are other, better steak restaurants.</body>

        <body>i was surprised at how ruse my waitress was... honestly its liek i was in a random resatuant on the corner of any old high street, not in the city at a big name...  the main courses (the beef and the 3 way ribs) were shockingly DRY! like inedable!  the only postive is when they asked what was wrong with the food and i told them, the manager offered me 2 free drinks or free dessert but tbh by then i wanted to just leave... but then even that was hard and my waitress paid NO attention to me so it was difficult to ask for my bill!!!  2nd bad experience at a jamie olover restaurant, and i wont be going to 1 ever again!</body>

        <body>Lovely ambience, very busy, friendly staff, When you enter the restaurant it is very impressive with a large meat chiller on display. My Client and myself had a starter which was good however we ordered fillet steak and mine was fill uf stringy sinew I did not complain because I did not want to make a fuss and it would seem that fortunately my clients steak was good. I found it dissappointing that a chef would cook and serve steak like this. As a well travelled eater of steak I know that you can always tell when you cut a peice of steak from the fillet you would see all of this sinew. This is the first time I have used this restauarant, I will now  return to the Gaucho Grill   Gilly Devan</body>

        <body>Came to Barbecoa for my 30th with a bunch of mates. We had a great table that seated us all within talking distance from each other and which had great view of St Paul&apos;s. The food was great and included a selection of steaks, ribs and other BBQ-fare, as well as several fish options. Not one for veggies! Good selection of craft beers (local and import), and the wine list was extensive (if pricey). Would definitely go again and recommend if you&apos;re looking for a decent meaty meal!</body>

Great setting with St Paul&apos;s as a backdrop, a restaurant that serves great food at the same time as giving you a location to really appreciate the city. When you book ask for a table with a view of the cathedral.</body>

        <body>The starter I had was Baby Back Ribs, it was quite tasty, but it was barely warm. it felt a bit dry  like it was placed on the food warmer counter while our other starters were been prepared.  The discretionary tip of 12.5% was skillfully added to the total, so it was not until later that evening that I noted the figure (it was quite a lot more money than the service received). It should be refunded, as in our case the service were received was not worth more than half the tip discretionally levied on us. That said, I will be back, but much wiser.</body>

        <body>The food was decent.  The service makes was great.  My wife recommended it since she like Jamie Oliver’s shows on Food TV.   Given the price of meals, the value just isn’t there.  There are other restaurants in London that goes the extra mile to make the experience better.  It was packed the night we went, so make sure you make reservations.</body>

        <body>The ribs &apos;three ways&apos; was amazing. Rump steak was also very good. I would give the pork scratchings a miss (more like prawn crackers) and the desserts were average - but do go for the meat and the view of St Paul&apos;s cathedral. A real treat overall.</body>

        <body>Been to Barbecoa 4 times now. It&apos;s consistently good. Service is friendly, the staff are extremely well informed about the menu, provenance of the ingredients and the techniques. They&apos;re incredibly accommodating too and serviced my request for an off the menu option (BBQ tomatoes, amazing!).  The portion sizes are substantial, we always find it unnecessary to order a starter other than the bread. The drinks menu could be expanded, they&apos;ve chosen to push wines which is great if that;&apos;s your thing, but it would be nice to see a few more ales and ciders added to the selection.</body>

        <body>Went with friends on Sunday evening. I have booked the table 2 weeks in advance especially requested for a table by the window for a nicer view as it was my friends first visit to London. The lady at the reception only had a glance at the additional request as she was trying to arrange a table for us despite requesting weeks in advance. Not very professional i must add. She then informed me that there was no tables by the windows available for 3 and seated us by the kitchen with no window view. I then noticed they had other larger tables available. I then requested  to move to a table for 4 without a decent view.  The waiter was friendly, sadly at least 25% of the main course on the menu was not available on Sunday evening. 12 dishes on the main course menu and 4 dishes was not available. Also we ordered BBQ ribs 3 ways,later the waiter informed us that they only had 2 ways as the 3rd rib was no longer available! I was certainly not impressed with the food availability considering it </body>

        <body>Barbecoa was a big disappointment.    I had been looking forward to trying Barbecoa for many months and went with my wife and two friends.  I love to barbeque even in winter, so I was really looking forward to seeing how the pros do it.  We had pork scratchings and crab &quot;hush puppies&quot; with beers to begin.   The scratchings were made of almost nothing but air and were just peculiar, nobody really having much good to say about them; the crab &quot;hush puppies&quot; good, but mostly that was the responsibility of the sauce which was very tasty rather than the deep fried crab balls which were non-de-script.  For starters two of us had baby back ribs, which were good.  The three different marinades were interesting.  The salad was spicy but a bit too salty.  Overall a success. The others had crab and fennel.  This was lacked flavour, vibrancy and acidity.  For mains two of us had a trio of ribs, which were good.  My wife and I (unfortunately) had the pit beef which was in part very fatty and in equ</body>

        <body>Having eaten at Barbecoa previously,I bkd a table to celebrate my daughter&apos;s 18th.Emailing ahead the occasion &amp; requesting a table with a view of St Pauls.On the night, we arrived to be told there was no window table available &amp; led to a table at the back of the restaurant which was not acceptable.We returned to the bar area to wait for a more suitable table-we were not offered drinks or menus but just left sitting there.Eventually we were shown to a table-with a view of St Pauls.We ordered ribs &amp; prawns as starters which were tasty-a finger bowl to go with the ribs would have been good.After a longer than usual wait,our main courses arrived-steak med/well &amp; chateaubriand.My partner&apos;s steak was bloody &amp; served on a cold plate.The chateaubriand arrived on a cold white plate, 4 pieces of meat &amp; nothing else.Having previously ordered the same dish,I expected it to arrive nicely presented on a wooden board-At £75, this is not a cheap dish &amp; we were left feeling very let down.Our side orde</body>

        <body>The food was good. The meat was delicious. We had a Chateaubriand steak to share and there was plenty of meat. It was really a case of quantity meats quality. The meat was exceptional - most probably the best we&apos;ve had in London (yes better than Hawksmoore and Gaucho!!!). The service was really good and staff knowledgeable. The only let down were the mushroom that we had as a side and the calamari really - not a great starter and needs to be improved (hence the 3 stars). It is pricey but well worth it. We would definitely go back for a treat.</body>

        <body>Me and my partner dined here friday.  When we entered it wasn&apos;t until we sat down that I was asked if I wanted to check my coat so it had to be passed awkwardly over the table, my large handbag and partners coat were ignored. The tables are packed in together and you feel so far away due to lengh you have to shout to here each other,  which explains the loud atmosphere.  The food was average I had the pit beef and it was dry my partner had the three way ribs and said they were below par. During the meal we saw countless waiters and even two managers standing by the bar with pads taking notes while looking at the diners. It&apos;s always great to feel like you are being rushed out of a meal that you didn&apos;t enjoy and have paid over the odds for.    An expensive meal is fine if the quality, service and ambience is great. If it is not there like with the Barbecoa it&apos;s just a scam.</body>

        <body>Lunch with my wife and three kids. Service has always been a strong suit here, and nothing is too much trouble. BUT, and it&apos;s a big but, the quality of meat has taken a fall. You can get far superior steaks at Hawksmoor - the cuts here are uninspiring, no choice about weights, and provinence is not really talked about much. If you&apos;re a real carnivore, just don&apos;t bother with Barbecoa.</body>

        <body>I booked a table here based on the generally very positive reviews on OpenTable. I have to say I was slightly disappointed though.  We had to wait 15-20mins for our table (understandable as it was busy) however the food didn&apos;t quite match up to the price for me. The ribs were excellent, as were the bbq baked bean burnt ends, however the crab starter and the calamari weren&apos;t great.  It was also very loud in here - again understandable I guess with such a busy restaurant.   Overall, it was a nice place to try but I doubt I would go back.</body>

        <body>Pretty noisy due to high ceilings and staff arguing next to where we were sitting. Tables pretty close together too.  Steak was competently cooked but not up to the standard of similar priced restaurants in London. Chips were small and fragmented as if they were from the bottom of the batch.  Asked if the sauce came on the side and was told yes. It came all over the steak.  Another one of those places that presumes it is OK to stick a quid on your bill for their chosen charity.  (-1 star for that). I would have asked to have it and half of the included service charge removed if I hadn&apos;t wanted to just leave.</body>

        <body>The Open Table of 50% off the a la carte menu constitutes very good value. The menu is wide with several original dishes. Particularly noteworthy are the numerous imaginative vegetarian options which is not always the case in some restaurants. The portions were large but of very good quality. The ambience is generally satisfactory although the tables are perhaps too close together resulting in conversations from neighbouring tables being overheard. The service is faultless. For particular commendation was our main waiter, Sofiane, who was polite, helpful, cheerful and discreet. A restaurant to be recommended.</body>

        <body>We were having a pre-theatre meal and arrived at 5.45 so should have had enough time. They knew we had to be out by 7.15pm. However, staff were slow to take our order and very slow to being our main courses, which meant we were constantly looking at out watches, and had no time for desert. However, what we ate was very good: &apos;The best french onion soup I have ever tasted&apos;; Delicious cassoulet of mussels, clams and chorizo; succulent breaded calamari and delicious griiled tiger prawns.</body>

        <body>We had booked this table for a relaxing Saturday night meal during our London Weekend. It was very busy and the serving staff appeared rushed. Food was good, but the timing of delivery of some things was a bit haphazard. As no-one offered us a drink when they gave us menus, we had to wait to order an aperitif and bowl of olives until the waiter came to take our food order. He then ordered all together. As a result, our mains arrived before the aperitifs and olives! So it was a bit rushed rather than relaxing! To be fair, he did cancel the olives. We then had two people offering us desserts.  To sum up, good food, nice place but I think they need more staff at busy times.</body>

        <body>You feel like going back home everytime you are here!  The waiters give you the biggest smiles they have and can&apos;t wait to serve you!  Food is still on the slightly salty side, but absolutely delivious.  My friend who is a vegetarian loves it - as she has three salad options and two soup options to pick, and she got a total of 4 mains to pick from the a la carte!  Absolutely fabulous night.</body>

        <body>... it hasn&apos;t. I am always astounded by this restaurant. Having first gone in &quot;on spec&quot; some 4 years ago because they could seat me on a busy end-of-week evening I keep finding that it is one of those places that keeps up its standards in the face of the commercial pressures of Covent Garden. I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for an intimate or romantic meal in Covent Garden, especially if you can get a table downstairs The food is always magnificent and tastes good as only the French can make food taste. The service is friendly and accommodating almost to the point of vacillation. Its only problem is that it gets full too quickly on show nights.</body>

        <body>I was a regular at Boulevard when living in London some 20 years ago.  It was an excellent venue, that served me well for celebratory meals with the family, through to intimate romantic dinners for two of an evening.    Thus, having experienced the disappointment of returning to old haunts to find them changed beyond all recognition, it was with a certain sense of trepidation that I booked Saturday lunch at Boulevard for myself and my girlfriend, prior to seeing a matinee on Drury Lane.  And I was most certainly not disappointed.  Although I&apos;m no longer on first name terms with the staff, they were attentive and courteous and went out of their way to ensure we had a lovely time.  The food was fantastic:  my girlfriend&apos;s fig salad starter was &quot;the best I&apos;ve ever had&quot;, my baked brie in filo with cranberry chutney was perfect.  My steak frites was OK - not the best bit of steak I&apos;ve ever had, and I wish I&apos;d gone for the fillet, but perfectly serviceable and cooked blue, as requested.    </body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been going to Boulevard Brasserie for many years, probably since it opened as I worked nearby for over a decade. It never disappoints, and this trip was particularly good. We had a table upstairs with a lovely view. We three girls arrived at 7 and ate but a friend who is diabetic could not eat before 8.30 for  medical reasons so when he arrived, after we had eaten, he ordered a main course. He asked for a simple salad and some Parmesan (neither of which were on the menu) to accompany his meal. The young waiter could not have been more accommodating and charming and took some trouble to bring my friend what he&apos;d asked for, without knowing why his dietary requirements were so particular. The restaurant emptied out until we were the only table left but we weren&apos;t made to feel as if we had to leave at any point. The meal ended with a little Lemoncello on the house and a warm goodnight from all the staff. A real gem in touristy Covent Garden and a beacon of hope among all the chain re</body>

        <body>I went to Boulevard Brasserie in Covent Garden with a friend. I had been here before and as before I was not disappointed. The food was lovely, I had the quinoa salad to start and the sea bass as main and both were really good. The service was faultless and we were not rushed which was a nice. We booked the 50% al la carte discount so it definietly was fantastic value for money. I will definitely be going back again.</body>

        <body>A very enjoyable dinner for four old friends in relaxed surroundings. The food was good and authentic; the wine list was short but well-chosen. The only real criticism was that the restaurant was far, far too dark. It was impossible to read the menu without the light of a mobile phone and you simply could not see what you were eating.</body>

        <body>Booked a table 2hrs before a theatre show so had plenty of time to sit and enjoy a pre-meal chat. On arrival the staff greeted us with friendly smiles and showed us to our table. The menu was good and there was plenty to choose from. The food arrived and we were all pleasantly surprised that portion sizes were good and by the end of the meal no one on the table felt they needed any more to eat. We were well tended throughout our visit and when the bill arrived we were very happy to pay the requested amount. We have already recommended this restaurant to friends and would certainly visit again.</body>

        <body>Well located for pre-theatre dining, but menu unimaginative. No steak/frites for example at a reasonable price and no interesting salads.  Set menu very limited and pretty stodgy.  Starters better than mains.  Friendly and helpful if not very well informed staff and good ambiance.  In summary, good to meet up with friends before the theatre, but that&apos;s about all.  Shame, the menu could be so much better.</body>

        <body>The first time I dined at this restaurant with my partner, which was about a years ago, we absolutely loved it as food and service were great. However we have been back a couple of times since and each time we have been back it has got significantly worse. This most recent visit was the last straw unfortunately. The service was terrible. The waiter forgot to bring our wine, was generally very slow and forgot to put our opentable special offer discount on the bill. My prawns were very overcooked and the sauce tasted burnt. The experience was also made worse by the table sat next to us, complaining very loudly after waiting over 2 hours for their main course and as a result missing their train. We went to the Palm Court Brasserie (same owners) since this visit, which does a similar menu, and is much better, so would recommend there instead.</body>

        <body>We had another great meal at Boulevard Brasserie. This time there were six of us and we had a fantastic table in a booths alcove which was just right for a group. Our waiter was charming and the food was very good. We all enjoyed our evening and will certainly return.</body>

        <body>I booked Boulevard 24 hours earlier for early evening dinner prior to a theatre visit after looking through Open Table recommendations around Covent Garden. The restaurant was almost empty on our arrival. I have booked 2 Course and Kir Royale at £17.50 Service was excellent, food very good. We had a couple of glasses of house wine which was alos very good. Thoroughly recommend.</body>

        <body>Boulevard Brasserie is well placed for a number of theatres in the area, as wellas the opera House, and sensibly provides a pre-theatre menu.When booked through Opentable, this includes a cocktail. Unlike many such menus, there is a reasonable choice for each course (four dishes per course) and the food itself is very tasty. Our helpful waiter checked at the outset whether we were going to a show, and made sure that we finished our meal in good time.</body>

        <body>Lovely food on a summery spring afternoon with a friend. Good selection of vegetarian choices for my friend and great options beyond posh nosh and chips. Drinks were London prices as expected but the issue was the over attentive staff that failed to make eye contact when taking the orders. It felt as of they didn&apos;t appreciate us as customers which dampened the experience. However I would go back again pre/post theatre for an evening meal.</body>

        <body>Visited on a Sat evening on our way to see Shakespeare in Love. The pre-theatre menu had plenty of choice and the food was all lovely. The service was brilliantly quick and efficient for the most part, though we did have to ask for our jug of water twice before it was brought (arriving after the starters). My big grumble was that sitting downstairs, while the ambience is cosy and interesting down there, it was absolutely roastingly hot - and this was in March. It would definitely put me off going in the Summer months as it was pretty unbearable even on a mild day and made the visit a little unpleasant. Lucky we were in and out in an hour really.</body>

        <body>Took my mum with my sister here for pre-theatre dinner on Saturday.  Very attentive service, very good food, nice ambience in restaurant and tables not too close together.  There was a strange whiff of cheese around the place but soon became accustomed to it.  Very good value with the two course + kir royale for £17.50.  Would highly recommend.</body>

        <body>We attended when all pre-theatre had gone. We wanted a good value meal with no element of &quot;fast food&quot; or &quot;chain&quot;. We were shown to a suitable table and it was fully explained to us how the &quot;Opentable&quot; offer operated.The service was good and quick and we had certainly no complaints about the food. I never like the &quot;discretionary service charge automatically added&quot;, but I do often see it - be aware as it&quot;sneaks under the radar&quot; sometimes</body>

        <body>Went for a pre theatre meal and wasn&apos;t disappointed. The service was friendly and prompt without feeling rushed. The food was very good with good portion size and complimented by a decent wine list. I particularly liked the option of a half bottle of wine when there&apos;s only two of you. All in all a very good venue for a pre theatre meal and would certainly go there again.</body>

        <body>Really French atmosphere here  Menu looked good   However the starter I ordered was not available nor was the main course I ordered  When I expressed surprise that it was lunchtime  and already no calamari and no pork belly  the waitress had a face as long as a gasman&apos;s coat .  No apology  Then my companion found her water glass had a piece of glass missing from the rim    Replaced with a grim look from said waitress who did return later to apologise    When the bill arrived we found the 50% had not been deducted for the food   Grim faced waitress rectified this . altogether a not very satisfactory experience    The younger waitress was charming but the slightly older one needs retraining  .</body>

        <body>I had checked on the phone that it wasn&apos;t a Valentine&apos;s menu and that we wanted the pre-theatre. Unfortunately, on arrival we were told that we could only have the Valentine&apos;s menu or a la carte.  This was disappointing, &amp; a let down, as we were a family of five adults.  Waiter service professional.  Perhaps if we&apos;d sampled the pre-theatre we would of returned, but limited choice means we won&apos;t return.</body>

        <body>I booked a last minute table for 7, and they were very accommodating and helpful- they even offered a dessert that was not on the menu so we could have something to fit everyone =). Great service, nice location, good atmosphere. The food was pleasant but did not set the house on fire but the rest of my table really enjoyed the meal.  I would definitely come back and probably order the duck next time =p</body>

        <body>The standards have massively slipped over the years. The waiter pretty much ignored every other table apart from a group of 6 good looking ladies. Quite comical on reflection but when your trying to get his attention and he intentionally ignores you its very irritating. The Sunday roast beef took a long time to arrive and when it did it was like canteen food. Roast potatoes were undercooked, beef was chewy and the meat used was pretty much just fat and sinew which was disgusting. 12.5% service charge was smacked on to the bill but the waiter didn&apos;t question why we wanted it taken off which was one bonus.</body>

        <body>4 of us decided to meet up for dinner with short notice and I booked Boulevard Brasserie also with short notice, taking the 50% of the menu offer. None of us had been there previously. We dined late at 21.15 and 2 of us came later we order two dishes to start with and our mains when the other two arrived. The menu offered a good and concise range definately catering for what we were looking for. We were all pleased with the dishes, particularly the mussels with the very creamy sauce, the tuna steak and the seabass. The service was very good! The ambiance French contemporary is a very pleasant way. We left very late, being the last guests, but the  staff dis in no way urge us to go and were very friendly to the end.  We can only recommend Boulevard Brasserie and we plan to return.</body>

        <body>We visited for a pre-theatre dinner and to celebrate a birthday.  Nothing was too much trouble: the waiter was friendly, welcoming and very good humoured.  The food was enjoyable - one of our party has food intolerances which can sometimes be a problem but the waiter and chef went out of their way to accommodate this.  The waiter brought a birthday dessert with candles and about four members of staff gathered round to sing &apos;happy birthday&apos;.  We would definitely go again!</body>

        <body>Despite mentioning that we needed to leave at 7.00 for the theatre, when booking, on arrival and on ordering our main course had not arrived at 6.50. After another reminder it arrived at 6.55! Rushed what was great food.</body>

        <body>Great location for pre theatre dinner. The set menu was good value. The service was speedy without being intrusive or hassled. We were well received at the entrance and shown to table upstairs where we had a window table looking down on the bustling street below. Liked the additional availability of a 500 ml carafe instead of usual 750 ml bottle which met with our time restraints. Would recommend and would visit again.</body>

        <body>If it wasn&apos;t for &quot;trying to  be funny&quot; reply from the waiter&apos;s response to my question about which rice had been used to make the risotto, this meal would have been perfect.  BB is always a bit hit and miss, but serves great food and you have remind them you deserve 50% off food with the OT deal.  Enjoy it... It&apos;s lovely and central.</body>

        <body>the service was good but the restaurant is definitely showing signs of needing a refurbishment.  Looked dirty inside and out (décor).  The food was ok but nothing spectacular - I ordered salmon on crushed potatoes and that is what I got, no vegetables, no side salad so looked sparse and I felt a little robbed.  In great anticipation I ordered crème brulee for dessert (my favourite) but was sadly disappointed as the layer of caramel was barely there and the crème tasted and looked like set packet cus</body>

        <body>I met up with old friends for a lunch, picking this venue as it had good reviews.   The welcome was good, and the service fairly attentive but I was constantly brushed by a waiter moving behind me to serve a table which was on my left and more tucked away. The noise from diners and also the music played(too loud) was obtrusive and detracted from my enjoyment of the occasion.  We went for the 50%off option, and the food was reasonable, but only at those prices.   I will not return and would not bring a group here.</body>

        <body>We had a fabulous afternoon last Saturday where we opted for the 3 courses and a Kir Royale for £20.50. Excellent value. Sometimes the choice on the set menu is limited but here we got lots and the quality of the food was great. Service was outstanding, attentive but not pushy and the restaurant was really comfortable. A great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. I would definitely recommend!</body>

        <body>I am always pretty skeptical about restaurant in Covent garden - often they cater to the pre-theatre crowd, charging a high price for poor service and poor food.  I have to say, therefore, that our group was pleasantly surprised by the boulevard brasserie.  It was a bit tight for space but the food was great and in terms of value, with 50% off, we were very happy!  One small criticism - the house red was awful!!</body>

        <body>The restaurant is well situated for Covent Garden and we even managed to find a parking space so it was a short walk to the restaurant and another short walk to the theatre.  There was plenty of choice on the menu but there was a little wait after the main course which meant that we were tight on time for dessert so we had to give it a miss.  All the food was good.</body>

        <body>An excellent location for a meal before a visit to the Royal Opera House, the Boulevard Brasserie provided an acceptably tasty meal of paté de foie followed by salmon with crushed potatoes and hollandaise sauce.  Good value with the Open Table offer of a 2-course meal with accompanying kir royale. Pleasant, friendly service. Not outstanding, but a good experience for being in the right place at the right time</body>

        <body>Unfortunately we had to leave before our main course was served as the restaurant were unable to provide us with what we&apos;d ordered from their Pre-Theatre Menu, even though we were there for an hour and twenty minutes.. We got our starters and wine quite quickly but then the rest of the order was clearly forgotten until we&apos;d asked about it several times. We had to pay up and run to catch the curtain up of the show that we were going to see. They very kindly only charged us for our wine so we had our starters for free. I had had the salmon with lentils, which was delicious. A great shame. Mind you, the £4.50 tiny pot of Pringles and the £3.50 ice cream that we bought during the interval at the theatre as a replacement for the dinner were considerably cheaper than the meal would have been. Every cloud....</body>

        <body>Great value for money.  Super location  - very close to the theatres and the hustle, bustle and exciting atmosphere of Covent Garden.  I had the salmon and lentils for starter and boeuf bourguignon and mash - all very tasty, not rushed. I would definitely recommend the pre-theatre menu.</body>

        <body>Had a lovely meal here in the week. It wasn&apos;t too busy which meant there wasn&apos;t much noise or bustle going on whilst you ate. The only thing we were disappointed with us that they automatically added 12.5% service to the bill....which for 3 people I thought was a bit much as we didn&apos;t require that much service. We had a special meal deal too so the food was good value for money. Would recommend to friends.</body>

        <body>Seated upstairs by window and found the staff very courteous.   Had 2 course pre-theatre meals.  I chose salmon and creme brulee.  Extremely tasty, however, very garlicy.  My husband had the pork chop which he enjoyed and chocolate pot.  Would certainly recommend this restaurant as went to see Beautiful and was situated near Aldwych theatre.  Nice ambience and value for money.</body>

        <body>we were well received on arrival and our table was immediately available. The waiter&apos;s knowledge of the menu could be better along with his command of English! He did annoy me with announcing that we were on the 50% deal (no need for this) and he announced that the steak &amp; chateaubriand were not part of the deal which had NOT been mentioned at the time of booking. That having been said, the food was great, each course arrived in a timely manner and the wine was excellent. It almost felt like being in France and the ambience added to the enjoyment of the dinner especially as we could hear our conversation without screaming at each other! Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>The dishes we ordered were tasty, albeit rather salty. The wine selection quite minimal. Service fast and with a smile. Gabriele, our waiter, was very welcoming and friendly. The set menu could be good value, but the &quot;a la carte&quot; dishes are on the more expensive side. We were seated on the entrance hall, with uncovered tables. Later we discovered that the other rooms of the restaurant were more elegant with white table clothes.</body>

        <body>Me and two friends had an excellent and enjoyable meal here on Saturday night. I enjoyed three courses of excellently-priced, classic french food - french onion soup, a rabbit main course and creme brulee - all were generous portions and delicious. Service and general friendliness and attentiveness of staff was excellent. The restaurant was particularly helpful when booking the table in meeting a special request relating to my friend&apos;s mobility issues and it is obvious that the restaurant&apos;s staff care about their diners and their experience. The ambience of the restaurant was lovely with candlelit tables and surprising privacy given the closeness of some of the tables. I visited Boulevard Brasserie regularly nearly ten years ago, but hadn&apos;t been for some time. It was great to see that standards had remained high in the intervening years. Would definitely go again and recommend to anyone looking for a mid-priced, high-quality restaurant in the area.</body>

        <body>I have dined on several occasions at the Boulevard Brasserie before heading out to the theatre.  The quality of food and service is consistently reliable and the food engaging enough for me to happily return.  The food did not lose out because of the pressure of serving many theatre diners.  The only downside that I would point to is that the tables are rather packed together.</body>

        <body>We had a lovely meal at Boulevard Brasserie pre theatre, made extra special by the great service we received from Marco.  Nothing was too much trouble and he was professional and friendly.  My chicken and chips was delicious but so big I had no room for desert which was a shame because Jonathon&apos;s tarte tatin looked lovely.</body>

        <body>My birthday treat lunch was also a pre-theatre meal on 28th February.  A very warm welcome and could not fault the staff.  As my daughter has several dietary issues these were explained and totally understood by everyone, which led to a memorable lunch for us both.  Special thanks to Carlos who was so gracious.  Having left some shopping behind we had to return later to collect it - nothing was too much trouble for all the staff!  Thank you for making the day so special.</body>

        <body>I asked for Soup as my starter. I was surprised to see that bread was omitted when the soup arrived. The waitress asked if I wanted bread and said it would be £2 !  Everytime I have ordered soup in a restaurant bread has ALWAYS been served alongside the soup.  The main I ordered was the fish and that was delicious. I do not think I would visit again. My friend chose this restaurant because of the offer of 50% of the food.</body>

        <body>We booked for a pre theatre menu for 6 on Sat 14th March.   We were made to feel very welcomed and seated in a lovely table by the window.  Three of our party had the pre theatre menu which was excellent value for money, especially with the glass of Kir Royale thrown in.    The other members of the party picked from the Al La Carte and equally enjoyed their meal.   The only grumble was cool coffee that we sent back and was quickly rectified and the mushroom soup that turned out to carrot!.  We were however offered an alternative.    I would certainly recommend the Boulevard Brasserie  and would definitely visit again</body>

The service was impeccable and the food all 4 of us felt it was one of the best meals, Sea bass, Mussels, Seafood pasta and steak all cooked to perfection. We will definitely recommend and go to this restaurant again</body>

        <body>We booked the special offer (3 courses + glass of Kir Royale) for £20/head through Open Table. However the restaurant did not honour this and charged £22.50/head - disappointing. Otherwise all was good as on previous occasions - just take care the deal you sign up for is honoured by the restaurant when the bill arrives.</body>

        <body>Although we had booked we had to wait for a  table and this did mean we were a bit rushed. We had to chase to order and also for drinks which were included in the offer. That said the food was good basic fair, portions were generous and good value. As we did not rate the service, however it was disappointing that 12.5% was automatically added to the bill - would have preferred the discretion to tip as we thought fit. The restaurant is well located for a number of theatres so would possibly consider returning</body>

        <body>The waitresses are attentive and the locaiton is fabulous in the heart of covent garden.  While the food is definitely worth the value and has great flavours, they are on slightly the salty bit.  But definitely will visit again!</body>

        <body>This was the third time I had been to the Boulevard Brasserie, and it was even better than I had remembered.    We sat downstairs for the first time in a quiet alcove - perfect for a relaxing catch-up with friends.  The food was excellent - the men had liver and bacon and moules, both of which they raved about (we all dunked bread into the mussel broth which was delicious and plentiful).  The girls had salmon with garlic potatoes and hollandaise - also delicious.  Chocolate pots and tarte tatin were excellent too.  House wine was fine as well.  The service was brilliant - sorry, I don&apos;t remember our waiter&apos;s name but he was great: very patient with us while we dithered over what to have, accommodating when we wanted to combine pre-theatre menu + a la carte + gourmet card, and good fun throughout despite being (apparently) in sole charge of the downstairs dining area.  A perfect evening - thank you!</body>

        <body>Booked this literally ten minutes in advance with a friend for a catch-up dinner. Food was good although nothing ground-breaking. Considering the number of mediocre eateries in Covent Garden it&apos;s a good find. Food was a little slow coming out but we had lots to chat about so didn&apos;t mind. :) They didn&apos;t hassle us to leave after we were done, which I also appreciated.</body>

        <body>The food was very good, especially the fillet stake and the Brie in a filo pastry. The Olives we ordered as apéro didn&apos;t arrive, so we had to ask again. The wine we ordered for each course well in advance only arrived nearly at the end of the course. When we asked for the final bill, the desert was not discounted. Another 20 minutes went by without an adjusted bill. I had to go to the till and get the waiter to do it in front of me. Very disappointing service, I guess that is what you get when there is a compulsory 12.5% service charge and the waiters don&apos;t need to make an effort. I have to admit it was busy and the waiters were short staffed but this is likely the normal case here. Good food, would go back for the food but not to celebrate a special occasion. Very good tastecard offer.</body>

        <body>We dined here last Friday, this was our second visit in 5 weeks.   The service was very good, friendly and efficient.  We were asked if we were going to the theatre and as a result of this our food was served quicker than if we were not. It&apos;s a great location for a pre theatre dinner, we were met with a smile and shown to our table, the food is good and service efficient and unintrusive. I chose the seafood linguine which was delicious, the portion for me was far too big, half would have been sufficient.  A lovely traditional crime brûlée for dessert went down a treat.  I do find the coffee there a bit on the bitter side but that&apos;s just my personal opinion. All in all a nice friendly restaursnt and we would go again if going to the theatre.</body>

        <body>Took my mum for her 70th birthday. Went to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and booked the Boulevard Brasserie before hand. Got a great deal 50% off your food menu A La Carte only. The portions were great and can thoroughly recommend the Seafood linguine and the beef Bourguignonne.  Great food, great location everyone enjoyed it. Thank you. Regards Brad Wirral</body>

        <body>Boulevard Brasserie looks on the outside like many other bistro type restaurants, but it always delivers at its price level and often has good offers.  Upstairs and down provide different atmospheres, upstairs often more busy and hectic, but this does not effect service, just whatever one suits you best.  Service is always good, but unintrusive and dishes are well prepared and served.  Wine list covers most points, although there are no bargain basement wines here.  Always enjoy a meal here.</body>

        <body>We booked Boulevard Brasserie for a post-theatre dinner on our anniversary weekend. Im so glad we did, we probably would have walked straight past it! It had a lovely ambience, not too big or busy with lots of candlelight, good value drinks and tasty food. I really enjoyed the meal and would go again</body>

        <body>Booked lunch for 5 on Open Table deal of Kir plus 2 courses.  Warmly welcomed.  Great service from Sofiane.  Food excellent and good value. Room a little noisy when full, so not ideal for intimate gatherings, but great for a general get together among friends.  Convivial atmosphere. Would definitely book again or use for pre-theatre dinner.</body>

        <body>Booked a table for four on Valentines Day for a pre theatre meal after using tripadvisor. The restaurant advertised a set meal for pre theatre bookings and this was also displayed outside on arrival.  We were seated and the receptionist gave us the menus showing is the pre theatre menu.  Happily made our choices to be informed by the waiter that due to Valentines Day these&quot; specials&quot; had been withdrawn!!!  We did point out that it was still advertised on the board outside but to no avail. This left a rather sour taste with the feeling we had been conned. Suggest you check that all the offers advertised are still available especially around Mothers Day, Easter, Fathers Day, Public Holidays, Christmas........  Very dispappointed</body>

        <body>Was there on Thursday night with 2 friends and we had a great time. The staff were particularly good, as was the food and all for a pre- theatre price. Nice atmosphere as well even if the upstairs did get a little quiet after everyone went to the theatre. Already planning my next visit for next Friday !</body>

        <body>The ambience was warm and welcoming.  Service was prompt and staff recommended dishes without being asked.  Goat&apos;s cheese salad was fresh and full of interesting flavours.  Duck confit was well cooked and tasty. My companion&apos;s tuna steak was well cooked and as she requested.  We had 50 per cent off the cost of the food which made it extremely good value.  Service was prompt but not rushed for our pre-theatre meal.</body>

        <body>I have visited several times and the experience has never let me down.  Frequently I book for a group and they always have enjoyed the meal.  I have recommended it several times, the last time yesterday, to a cousin who takes his eating out experiences very seriously</body>

        <body>The three-course menu is excellent value and the food good.  Service is very friendly and efficient, even when the restaurant is very busy.  It can be rather nois at times, especially in the evenings but that&apos;s a minor quibble for such a consistently nice place.</body>

        <body>Good value meal with 50% deal, would have been quite expensive otherwise.  Food was mainly good and so was the service.  The only thing that wasn&apos;t very nice was the dauphinoise potatoes, which were very rich and gloopy.  Would eat here again with the 50% offer</body>

        <body>Our second visit. Very good food, service and atmosphere. Would have liked a table on the ground or first floor but none available so we were in the basement. Despite this we had a very enjoyable family meal. We ate from the fixed price theatre menu which is excellent value for money. We would visit again.</body>

        <body>Having been to Boulevard many times before I took a group of friends for a birthday celebration. The morning of our meal I had a message to call the restaurant while I was in a meeting to confirm, which I did. We were 5 minutes late for our booking because of heavy rain to be told that they had given our table away and we were squeezed onto a smaller table. Not a great start but the food and service were up to their usual standard and the set menu was excellent value. I would recommend Boulevard to friends - but make sure they were aware of the unfriendly reception staff!</body>

        <body>Very average food for the price. Baked brie starter was almost cold. Service wasn&apos;t great with the food literally banged down in front of you. Was not asked whether we were happy with any of the courses and the bill at the end had someone else&apos;s items added to it + the undeserved 12.5% service charge. Don&apos;t bother- there are many other eateries in the area.</body>

        <body>We went the Boulevard Brasserie on Sunday for lunch. We were seated and offered drinks, and the selected dishes from the Open Table Sunday Lunch offer. This included a Bellini; which was very pleasant We had Brie in Filo pastry with a cranberry relish, and the smoked salmon with lentils as our starters. Both were good and came in adequate portions. We both selected the roast beef as our main course. I specifically asked if I could have mine as rare as possible. We both got beef cooked as we had requested. Unfortunately it was quite tough! The garnish was well thought out, with roast potatoes, carrots, cabbage and parsnips. There was also some pleasingly strong horseradish sauce. The Yorkshire pudding was a &quot;soggy pancake&quot;, but that was the luck of the draw, as other customers seemed to receive nicely crisped ones. For our third course we both opted for the Roquefort with poached pear. This came in the form of a hearty wedge of cheese with a pot of pear chutney, and some water biscuits</body>

        <body>This restaurant continues to deliver good food from an appealing menu with super service. It is a winning combination at full price but if you take advantage of their fix price options on the day or go for a pre-booked discount deal, the value is outstanding. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our latest visit.</body>

        <body>Went here for restaurant week, 3 courses and a kir royale for £20. For such a cheap price I was pleasantly surprised to find the food was very good! The brie starter in particular was great. Service was friendly and the place had a nice ambience.</body>

        <body>Great value for money we went on the 2 courses and a kir royale deal. The food was tasty and like a nice home cooked meal! Very reasonably priced drinks. However can&apos;t say that the 12.5% service charge was justified... Overall good experience</body>

        <body>Had the 50% off offer.  Food was tasty - we had french onion soup and boeuf bourguignon - although may be a bit salty for some.  Service was good and the restaurant has a cosy ambience - great for a pre-theatre meal!  Will come again.</body>

        <body>A restaurant that has the right balance of being a place for meeting friends, loved ones or business.  Good food, wine and ambience.  The choice of food is right, offering suitable dishes for vegetarians and non-vegetarians.  I have been here several times now, and will keep going back.</body>

        <body>I took 2 young Canadians, one of whom was celebrating her graduation, for dinner here. The latter had been put off by the discourteous service she&apos;d experienced in ANOTHER venue at lunch time, but the personable greeting we got as soon as we set foot in the Boulevard Brasserie, followed by the service offered by our waitress, made up for her lunchtime experience. My guests loved the food:all 3 services. Would I take other guests there? Most certainly!</body>

        <body>When I walked in, I saw a very elegant old lady having onion soup, it makes you feel like you are in Paris and she is a local and she goes there everyday. That was a very good first impression of the restaurant. And it didn&apos;t disappoint. Service was high quality. All the food we ordered was really nice. And good value too. Highly recommended. And it&apos;s a perfect place for a pre theatre meal I think.</body>

        <body>Went for a post theatre meal, staff attentive. One of our party decided on the tiger prawns, she asked the waitress if they came peeled, she said yes, but she misunderstood, the prawns came up in their shells, we asked for a finger bowl and was immediately asked if she would like an alternative meal, we said no it would be OK, the manager apologised. Later on the manager came to our table with the waitress they apologised again and gave us a kir royale  on the house, we were impressed with the service. Would recommend</body>

        <body>Superb atmosphere, layout, and cooking - service wasn&apos;t quite up to the mark on this occasion, had to wait a while to order and it was getting very late, and the menu was very heavy for eating just before bedtime, then we had to find our own coats - a little bit of a let down as I had a special guest for a birthday celebration, but will come back as it is still my favourite restaurant in London!</body>

        <body>We went to celebrate my birthday. My husband and I arrived a bit early but there wasn&apos;t a problem as our table wasn&apos;t in use so we were welcomed and seated immediately. Attentive and engaging staff without being overbearing. We ordered a cocktail each and water with no pressure to order wine. The food choices were not extensive but we enjoyed the food enormously. We both had the pea and mint soup which was fantastic and I had the monkfish and hubby had the veal. Both were again fantastic. Deserts also were lovely. All in all we absolutely loved our experience and again the staff were all very very nice. We will definitely go again, hopefully for our wedding anniversary in December.</body>

        <body>Too, my wife for her birthday in December and booked a good few months in advance, asking and hoping for a table in the conservatory based on past reviews. Thankfully we did get a table in there! Going by the quick view of other tables on the way out I reckon the conservatory adds or detracts (if outside there) about 30% of the experience. Service and food was amazing- can see why it gets booked way in advance and would look to go again!</body>

        <body>Amazing experience at a Clos Maggiore. Dishes that stood out were the pigs cheek and truffle mash. So rich in flavour! We were sat next to a table of 4 people who were slightly loud. Considering the room only had two other couples in there, the group of friends made the atmosphere a lot less intimate than I would have liked. Overall a lovely restaurant that I will definitely return to and recommend.</body>

        <body>I can&apos;t believe, having lived in London for fifteen years, that I haven&apos;t been here before: I think the location may have made me assume it would be a tourist trap.   It most certainly is not.  Two courses with half a bottle of wine for £24.50: both food and wine were superb and service was attentive and friendly. Romantic conservatory at the back, with a more formal dining room towards the front, it is a gem for all occasions.  I will be back within the month, no doubt about that.</body>

        <body>The food was outstanding and the service was good. I found that the location of where you eat is significant to the dining experience. My partner and I were seated near the front of the restaurant and so could not be immersed in the wonderful floral scenery towards the back of the restaurant. In fact, we were quite distracted by the fact that we could not sit in the main area.  Regardless, the food was exquisite.</body>

        <body>Not having met up with friends for a while, we chose Clos Maggiore as our venue to have lunch and to catch up with each other&apos;s news. We could not have made a better choice. From the moment we entered the restaurant, we were welcomed and made to feel special by every member of staff. we lingered over lunch but we were never made to feel hurried. Another delightful dining experience at Clos Maggiore.</body>

        <body>Although the four of us are English, we two  live in France and our two friends live in Canada, and we were meeting up in London.  We two had eaten twice before at Clos Maggiore  and were pleased to be able to take our friends there for lunch.  It was as good as we remembered and our friends were very impressed.  It was so nice to be able to mooch around Covent Garden, lunch  splendidly and leisurely,  then mooch again post-lunch.  Altogether a very enjoyable experience - without being too expensive!  The staff  were very obliging,  the food excellent (the petit fours served with coffee absolutely gorgeous) and the restaurant charming.</body>

        <body>You look at the website and obviously you want to book a table in that room with the flowers in the ceiling. There&apos;s nothing saying you can&apos;t or the waiting list is huge.  You book the table you actually write in the special requests that you would like your table to be on that specific room.  Nothing happens until the day before and they call you to confirm your reservation. They just ask you that you want to keep your booking and nothing else so you assume everything is fine.  You get to the restaurant and they take you to another room and when you ask that&apos;s when they tell you oh people on that room booked 3 to 4 months ago.  So, no information at all in the website and even after using the special requests field no one warned me about this not even in the day before when confirming the booking. Only when you get there and they take you to another room. And they ask if you want to take a picture in the other room with everybody else eating there.  That&apos;s how special my wife birthda</body>

        <body>We went here for my friend&apos;s birthday to make it a special evening and we loved it! We were sat in the conservatory, which is beautiful and received free glasses of champagne when we sat down. Service was attentive. The Food was delicious, the truffle Pasta and truffle mash being a highlight. Had a lovely dessert too. All in all, pretty much faultless and the restaurant in itself is just so pretty, you are just in awe the whole time :)</body>

        <body>This lovely restaurant manages to mix high end service and quality with precision and yet such ease that  the experience is comfortable rather than pretentious and pleasant rather than overbearing. Lovely, helpful, knowledgeable  staff and service seemingly working seamlessly without  effort. So much so, what should have been a quick half hour lunch was an hour and a half and we had to run to the theatre! Exquisite tastes and delightful presentation</body>

        <body>Our second visit did not disappoint. We had been for an evening meal to celebrate a special occasion. The conservatory was magical; the lights, ambience and just the right amount of company. We chose the Spring Taster menu and were blown away. This time we returned and went for a set lunch menu. The setting was just as inviting in the daytime and the meal was such excellent value for money that I know we will return again and again.</body>

        <body>Took my boyfriend there for his birthday to have a lovely romantic meal. It&apos;s exactly what we got. Wonderful food, a bible of a wine list and some free petit fours with happy birthday writen in chocolate sauce for the birthday boy. The decore is incredible with actual living walls and fair lights on the celing. Couldn&apos;t have asked for a more beautiful setting.  All of the above is reflected in the price as it was rather expensive but if it&apos;s a special occasion I really recommend this place.</body>

        <body>My husband and I went to Clos Maggiore for our anniversary dinner while traveling from the US. While we were unable to get a reservation at the time the tasting menu was available, we created an equally intriguing menu from the appetizers, entrees and especially the innovative and delectable desserts. The service was very attentive and obviously highly-trained and professional. The restaurant itself is surprising intimate (but not crowded); the conservatory, where our table was, was as beautiful as the pictures on the website. Finally, after all this, the value was quite wonderful, especially compared to other restaurants of a similar caliber.  Out of all the places that we dined in the UK over two weeks, this was the one restaurant that my husband said he would definitely make a reservation for any time he or we returned.</body>

        <body>The service at this lovely restaurant is wonderful, the front of house staff are clearly trained well and they are so friendly.   The food is amazing: we started with lobster tortellini in a rich bisque which was fresh as the sea and the pasta light pillows of perfection.  I had roasted fois gras with confit of duck which was utterly delicious.  The main courses were succulent chicken with broad beans, home made pan fried gnocchi with broad beans and a buttery sauce.  The other dish was Roasted Duck breast in honey cooked medium which was amongst the best duck dish I&apos;ve had but really, the star of the show was the vegetables.  We had vichy carrots which were unctuous and buttery with truffle mash done properly!  The food here is exceptional and the prices are great value.  The only downside is the 8 week wait for a table on a Saturday night!</body>

        <body>Took a friends to Clos Maggiore last Sunday to celebrate her 75th birthday. We had a wonderful day fully enjoyed the day at Clos Maggiore. The food, ambiance, service were all top notch as was the garden room where we were placed. Cannot fault Clos Maggiore in anyway and would highly recommend to one and all.</body>

        <body>I only chose this restaurant because my wife fell in love with the conservatory. And i&apos;m sure had we&apos;d been seated in there for her birthday in late March, this review would have been different. But because my request via phone and email beforehand was ignored and no attempt was made to seat us in the conservatory when we arrived (nor was any apology forthcoming from any staff members) my experience at the venue was one of disappointment. We were seated in the most unromantic and claustrophobic section, in a galley right next to where the food is brought up. It felt like I was in McDonalds such was the quantity of staff and customers brushing past me over the course of our meal, most asking where the toilet was. To have a conversation was then tricky because people equals noise. Not what i had anticipated for a birthday meal for my wife. The food was fair, but not worth the price charged. Service was slow and patchy, with a real lack of care and interest for the customer. The arroganc</body>

        <body>My husband and I paid one of our regular visits to Clos Maggiore for lunch and were a little disappointed to be seated in the upstairs area and not in the main restaurant, even though we had booked two weeks in advance. Sadly, the service in this area was not up to the standard of the main restaurant - the maître d&apos; was doing his best but he was run off his feet and any support which was sent to assist him just wasn&apos;t up to the usual expected standard. That being said, the food - as usual - was exemplary (the lunchtime set menu with matched wines) and it wouldn&apos;t stop us going again. Perhaps we&apos;d better book even further in advance next time!</body>

        <body>I went on a Monday (9th Mar) and had booked a month and half in advance and still didn&apos;t manage to get a table in the conservatory (romantic) area.  I feel that it was because we were a party of two and they prioritize the bigger groups of people who will be spending more money.   We were sat next to the meal distribution area, so had a lot of waiters rushing around us and occasionally could hear them arguing, to which a young boy who worked there had to tell the middle aged male waiter to calm down.  Apart from that, the food was exceptional and staff were very attentive, especially the young waiter who I mentioned above.</body>

        <body>We came here for a romantic meal after my boyfriend being away for a couple of months.  Everything was wonderful and the foie gras and the beef were very good - but the rabbit was simply devine and a lot of skill had gone into the plate.  The only downside was that for our pallet the truffle was too strong in the mash and therefore overpowered the main course.  Also we thought the wine was too cold - we were then told that it wasn&apos;t and that it is being served at the correct temperature.  We then asked to remove a second bottle from the cellar so that it would be to our liking - I can&apos;t recall the exact response but we had to repeat our request quite firmly.  I understand that we probably know nothing about wine (although that isn&apos;t true as my boyfriend is Italian and makes his own wine) but it just put a tiny dent in the experience.  However it was a wonderful meal and all the staff were friendly and attentive and the food (apart from the mash) was amazing.  I would come back again a</body>

        <body>place is a delight, the food is lovely and remarkable value on the Prix Fixe with a half bottle of excellent wine, and not, thank god a Merlot! service was impeccable, and the ambience was fantastic.  Just need to book well ahead if you want the conservatory, we say in the anti chamber and actually loved that as we could see in and the view was lovely but see most gripes are to do with being seated upstairs, not about food or service.</body>

        <body>Dinner was excellent, one of the best meals I&apos;ve ever had - prices were very reasonable and the restaurant itself is beautiful. Only complaint was that the restaurant was very hot as we went during summer and there was no air conditioning. But overall, extremely great experience and will be coming back.</body>

        <body>My husband &amp; I dined at this Restaurant Sunday lunch on 29th March to celebrate my Birthday and our Wedding Anniversary.  We had read a review about two years ago and it did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived, although the weather outside was miserable and we arrived a little damp, our spirits were soon lifted as we met with a warm welcome and promptly shown to our table in the conservatory which we were thrilled to receive as they are in high demand and only available on a first booked basis.  The service and food were excellent. Our waiters were professional and friendly and I enjoyed conversing in French. We had the 3 course Sunday Lunch menu @ £29.50 a head which was very good value with wonderful presentation. We chose our wine from &quot;the bible&quot; and I finished the lunch with an Expresso &amp; a liquer.  Nice touch also at the end when they brought out chocolates on plates complete with candles and Happy Anniversary and Birthday written in chocolate.  Overall a wonderful experi</body>

        <body>Clos Maggiore doesn&apos;t disappoint. It&apos;s certainly a place for a special occasion and not cheap, but the food was superb and the service and ambience can&apos;t be faulted. My tiny quibble would be that the advised wine selections by the glass seemed a little playing-it-safe and underwhelming given the quality of the food - I was expecting a real treat and exciting choices, but found myself ever so slightly bored. Nevertheless, overall a superb experience and it lives up to expectations.</body>

        <body>Small restaurant with sitting area for only 9 tables - thus it is often booked.  Unimpressed with the staff.  When asked to discuss the menu , their answer was &quot;everything is good.&quot;  I had to ask repeated questions in order to have items explained.  The staff were arguing among each other about events that occurred earlier on.  I have no interest in overhearing complaints.  Food was ok.  The conservatory is nice, however, is just plastic plants and fake flowers.  Nothing significant.  The experience is not worth the cost.</body>

        <body>we were initially a little upset as we were called before our booking and they confirmed we would be seated in the conservatory as it was a special occasion!  and we weren&apos;t, with no attempt of apology - in fact the lady who seated us was actually quite rude.  the food was delicious - the menu wasn&apos;t that vast though, with only a few options of each type!  reasonably priced on the pre theatre menu through and the service was great!  dont think i&apos;ll be rushing back though!</body>

        <body>Having failed previously to book a table, it was worth the wait and we were not disappointed.  The food was delicious, the service impeccable and the ambience and setting fabulous.  we were lucky to be right in the heart of the garden area.  We had the pre-theatre menu with half a bottle of wine; both the red and white that were on the &quot;deal&quot; were excellent and very good value.   We will definitely be coming back and what a great way to start our evening out.</body>

        <body>I chose this restaurant for its romantic feel and it didn&apos;t disappoint, great ambiance and service from the staff who were very attentive and they appeared to glide around with some smooth serving and pouring moves. I definitely would return to try more dishes. The lamb and sea bass dishes were lovely with the highlights of the meal being the  roasted duck foie gras starter and the amazing pecan nut ice cream dessert</body>

        <body>This is the third time we have visited our favourite restaurant, and whilst it retains all of its charm, ambience and outstanding service, the food this time wasn&apos;t quite the same. I ordered the Iberico pork as its a relatively sustainable meat originating from Iberian oak forests, but it tasted like a normal bit of pork with standard vegetables and normal gravy.  However the starter was delicious and my girlfriend had rabbit/duck which were both very nice.  Our wobbly table was fixed with enthusiasm by the waiters who are consistently very good.</body>

        <body>Dined with my wife on Sunday evening, having booked almost 3 months in advance to get a table in the conservatory. These are allocated on a first come first served basis and as there are only 7 tables in there it makes good sense to do so....Whether you are in the conservatory or not the food is absolutely delicious...We took advantage of the set-menu that is available on a Sunday evening for 34.50pp which includes 3 courses and half a bottle of wine....Gorgeous food, lovely ambiance and top class service makes this a standout for us when we are next in town...Fabulous...</body>

        <body>We couldn&apos;t fault the restaurant in any way . The staff were welcoming, friendly and efficient. The food was absolutely delicious!  We dined early evening from the pre- theatre menu which was excellent value especially considering the quality of the food and in particular the crab and lobster starter.  The restaurant were very good in accommodating my request for a table in the conservatory area as we were celebrating my husband&apos;s birthday.  The open fire and blossom trees created a unique atmosphere which was lovely and very romantic. The whole experience contributed  in making my husband&apos;s birthday celebrations extra special.  We will definitely make a point of returning when visiting London in the future.</body>

        <body>This restaurant was just as i had imagined beautiful ambience and almost has a slight New York restaurant feel to it. The staff were very attentive possibly a little to attentive at times but thats a personal preference. The food was wonderful executed very well and they Wagyu beef was divine. I very much enjoyed the experience of eating at a restaurant i had longed of dining at for quite some time. I cant imagine anyone being disappointed with Clos Maggiore.</body>

        <body>The only negative thing to say is that the menu was not the same as the one online which i checked in the morning, HOWEVER the food was fantastic. I can see why there is almost a 2 month waiting list. The resturaunt is not very big but the ambience, lighting and decor are amazing. Food was superb. Servuce was good. Nothing amazing but it was grrat that they do not rush you and just let you enjoy your food and time.  Would definately recommend to eat here. Also very sweet as for our 4 year anniversary they did a decorated plate which was very nice. Not over the top but kept it quiet and in keeping with the surroundings......overall fantastic resturaunt, well worth the wait.</body>

        <body>It seemed understaffed as we queued for a while waiting to confirm the reservation before being taken to our table. The lady kept fidgeting and murmuring I&apos;m very busy which was offcourse uncomfortable. The restaurant was very tight and just not cosy. Wait was not too long for the food but it was bland and really unsatisfactory. The worst part of the evening was seeing a waiter running after us as we walked to the car to verify if we had &apos;paid the bill&apos;. It was a complete nightmare. Needless to say I will not be going back, I would not recommend.</body>

        <body>I went with my girlfriend for our 3 year anniversary. Let me tell you it did not let us down one bit! We entered and were greeted by a very friendly woman and were seated on a sofa as our table was prepared as we were a little early. We were taken to our table and the pictures on the website don&apos;t do the courtyard area justice. There is a reason this is the most romantic restaurant in London. The scenery accompanied by the soft jazz music was perfect. The cocktails are really good here, I had an old fashioned and she had a bellini which were both brilliant. They have a near 60page wine list which is extensive to say the least! The food was amazing and they do not rush you at all. The staff were attentive and really helpful! We will definitely be going back here!</body>

        <body>The place was great and we were very excited. Definitely some amazing food. We were disappointed about not getting the conservatory (need 3 month&apos;s prior booking); the inside though, was very quiet and not quite in the age group.  Unfortunately they were unable to to do much to accommodate our preferences.</body>

        <body>Incredibly delicious food in an intimate setting, would wholeheartedly recommend to any  couples looking for somewhere special or friends wanting somewhere to catch up over a delicious meal. The prices are not cheap but neither are they unreasonable, particularly if you go for the pre-theatre options. Only minor gripe - I would have preferred a slightly wider selection on the menu, but I didn&apos;t have difficulty finding something I liked.</body>

        <body>We request a table inside when booking but they gave us a table in front which is beside aisle; the food is ok, but not excellent among the reasurants with the same price. The day we went is our anniversary, but because of the meal we donnot feel very happy.</body>

        <body>Overall it was a pleasant evening.  The service was disappointing though and took the edge of f the experience. We were left standing in the lobby for 5 minutes before being welcomed, then left in the bar seating area for 10 minutes while waiting for a menu and to be invited to order a pre dinner drink. Service at the table was by a rather disinterested waitress who did not engage in any way other than to &apos;take the order&apos;.  The wine waiter on the other hand was excellent, she was engaging and very helpful.</body>

        <body>Clos Maggiore is a fantastic place to eat. I&apos;m a bit of a &quot;harvester&quot; eater, quantity rather than quality for me normally. This was at completely the other end of the spectrum. I took my partner to Clos Maggiore and we were blown away by the the service. Everybody was so friendly and welcoming. My girlfriend was recommended a lovely wine from the very knowledgable staff, and the chef did a superb job with our food. It had a very relaxed atmosphere too. I can&apos;t stress how nice it was. The only thing I would suggest is booking early as the conservatory area is available to those who book in advance. 10/10. Loved it :)</body>

        <body>...they have Foie Gras on the menu. This has no place on any menu in my opinion and if the royals can take it off their menu then this restaurant should take it off theirs.   Other than that the food, service, and ambiance is excellent. The vegetarian offerings are the best I&apos;ve come across over from a fine dining restaurant.</body>

        <body>Fantastic evening. Ordered from the pre theatre menu and the food was delicious. Excellent bottle of wine recommended by the sommelier. The conservatory is a lovely setting and the tables are all very private and well spaced. Would definitely recommend Clos Maggiore to anyone and hope to visit again soon</body>

        <body>A small room, visually enlarged by mirrors, very romantic atmosphere!  Tables are rather near to one another, so you may be listening to your neighbors conversation, however That is the only negative about the entire experience!  Service was quick and efficient, without feeling rushed.  We selected the tasting menu, accompanied by their selected wines.  Every dish was a winner, wines had been chosen with care and we discovered some great new wines for future use.  All in all, a delightful experience and a great new discovery for us.</body>

        <body>The food is great and unlike many restaurants has generous portions. Service is excellent. Our white wine oxidized after we tasted it. When we brought this to their attention they immediately gave us another wine, which they didn&apos;t charge for. On a previous occasion the sommelier noted that the wine was slightly oxidized even before I tasted it and brought another bottle (which was fine).   The room at the back, if you can get a table there is beautiful.</body>

        <body>A delightful meal in a very nice environment at an excellent price. We didn&apos;t sit in the back part of the restaurant, which I think had a better ambience, but the food was very good and the service outstanding. The wine included in the pre-theatre deal was good and all courses were delicious. The starter and mains were possibly slightly on the heavy side of things, but that&apos;s a minor complaint.</body>

        <body>This restaurant never fails to impress. The service is always excellent, as of course is the food. I brought my friend here for the first time and she loved it also. We weren&apos;t rushed, and we were given a choice of tables . I find all tables to be secluded and well positioned, so no matter if we didn&apos;t book early enough or conservatory. I love this restaurant: probably my favourite in London. Great location too : in Covent gdn</body>

        <body>We book Clos every year for birthdays and Anniversaries. We&apos;ve been going for over a decade. And never once have they failed to deliver!   The latest time was for my Wifes birthday in April. We were sat in the &quot;courtyard&quot; area that you see in the pictures. While the rest of the restaurant are very nicely done, its this area that makes you feel like you&apos;re in another world! It&apos;s like being in a Perrier Jouet Belle Epoque bottle!   The food and service are both superb. Rabbit shoulder for starter, a lovely Wagyu beef for main and a stunning chocolate parfait for desert. Matched with a great Malbec that the Sommelier recommended. They even wrote happy birthday in chocolate and brought in a plate with some candles for my Wife to blow out.   If you&apos;re looking to take someone for a £200-300 meal for a special occasion (birthday, anniversary, engagement) THIS is the place. There&apos;s a reason it gets voted the most romantic restaurant in London. And a reason Heston Blumenthol used the building </body>

        <body>This place is just fantastic and a real hidden gem of London.  The conservatory is beautiful and the food matched the ambience. This is the second time I have been and the first time I thought j had stumbled on something fantastic and recommended it to friends for anniversary dinners etc all have been equally impressed. When I went back this time I thought if anything it had improved. First class food, first class service and one of the best atmospheres in London for a truly special meal.</body>

        <body>Looking at the desert menu it seems it&apos;s all variations on a theme - that theme being sorbet. As someone who is lactose intolerant I&apos;ve become accustomed to being disappointed at what is on offer on a desert menu, but have also learned that the test of a good chef is how they respond to what is becoming quite a common issue - they knew at the time of my booking my dietary need. After the waiter and manage both went away to see what they could get the chef to produce one came back listing out what sounded very exciting. What I got was sorbet a bit of fruit and a nut, in other words pretty poor show!  Please Clos Maggiore get another Pastry Chef, one who is creative rather than just thinks he is and one that can conjure something exciting rather than being out of his depth without a sorbet</body>

        <body>We found the Restaurant by chance whilst looking for somewhere to dine pre theatre as part of a special occasion. Although the internet (and web site pictures) give you an impression of the back conservatory room in reality it is much more spectacular than you imagine.   First impression mean a lot and the welcome we received as we arrived was warm, friendly and professional and, as mentioned, the impact of the room we were shown into was something special. The service and food all lived up to, and exceeded, the standards set by the welcome and impact of the decor combining to provide a very great start to the evening.   This is a real gem of a place with a unique combination of great staff, unusual decor and fabulous food - it is somewhere we hope to return to soon.  We can only thank everyone for making the meal memorable for all the right reasons.</body>

        <body>I attended this restaurant last Wednesday with a great friend.  It was her suggestion as she&apos;d dined at Clos Maggiore before.  What a treat!  Impeccable welcome and service,  a lovely table on the first floor, though my friend tells me the ground floor is the place to be.  As a result we were offered a ground floor table for our dessert and coffee, such a lovely touch.  It was turned down as I couldn&apos;t bear the thought of messing up another table cloth!   We had the 3 course set lunch with wine.  All the food was absolutely delicious on the palate and on the eye, including the bread and the petit fours.  The wine though unpretentious was right with the meal and beautifully served.  It was, indeed, a happy experience and very good value for money.  On departure I was shown the ground floor  dining space which as I had been told was quite amazingly attractive.  I will definitely return it was far and away the best meal I&apos;ve had in a restaurant for a long time.  Thank you Clos Maggiore!</body>

        <body>My sister and I ate at Clos Maggiore on Thursday as a birthday treat for my sister. The service was excellent and the setting was beautiful.  Our food was delicious and beautifully presented. They brought the petit fours out on a plate decorated with chocolate to say Happy Birthday which was a lovely finishing touch.  We have booked to go again in April with friends as we were so impressed.</body>

        <body>We book a table here each time we&apos;re in London. Service and food are excellent. From the greeting by the hostess to the final check, all are outstanding. Restaurant is very luxurious and the food is displayed to perfection. We came pre theatre and had a great experience. Each course was given care and was delicious. Will return when we are in London again</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Clos Maggiore many times over the years. I always choose it for special occasions in London, when I want a pretty setting with lovely food and great service. On this occasion I had to request a different table from the one which had been allocated, and this was dealt with without fuss. The staff made us feel welcome and valued as customers, the food was beautiful. The sommelier recommended a wine we both loved and the bill was very reasonable.</body>

        <body>This was our first visit to Clos Maggiore and I hope it won&apos;t be our last.  We went for Sunday Lunch before a matinee at Covent Garden and the whole experience was a delight. Our meal really couldn&apos;t be faulted. We chose the three course lunch with wine and also added an extra cheese course, every things was perfect. 10 out of 10 .</body>

        <body>We visited Clos Maggiore for a pre theatre lunch and have to say that it is one of the best resturants I have been to.  The conservatory covered in flowers is gorgeous with a burning fire also and will it take a lot to top this place for our next theatre lunch visit.  Cant fault it, everything was superb, food was very tasty and  we were really looked after by the staff.  You have to put this on your list of restaurants to visit!</body>

        <body>If you are lucky enough to get a table in the conservatory then this in itself  would justify the bill. The set pre-theatre menu is very reasonable for London and the food is good without being particularly exciting. (Or either particularly French or Italian for that matter).  There are some poor reviews out there, but often these hinge on the situation of the table rather than food or service.  Ignore these and see for yourself. If you are fortunate you might find yourself  dining in the prettiest setting in all of London.</body>

        <body>Having walked past this place many times thinking &quot;must go there&quot; we finally organised a visit and we weren&apos;t disappointed. Cocktails were excellent and food pretty good too. This place gives you what you&apos;d expect from the outside, and can&apos;t really be faulted. You wouldn&apos;t go here looking for a bargain meal, but the value is fine given the location and ambience. You wouldn&apos;t go looking for cooking that&apos;s &quot;out there&quot; either, and you won&apos;t get that. I&apos;d certainly go back for an occasion.</body>

        <body>I was in awe the moment we stepped into the conservatory seeing those flowers on the ceiling. The room was actually smaller than I thought as there were about 7 tables when we were there but that only added to the more special atmosphere. We didn&apos;t try the wine but our starters and mains were all very good. The staff were also very attentive and professional but still friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a special place to celebrate a special occasion!</body>

        <body>Far too much food on tasting menu plates especially the vegetarian options! Less is better- as so much puts you off and you dread the next plate. Simpler food perhaps on couple of dishes. You have to be really hungry to go for this option. Service was great, somelier good and knowledgeable</body>

        <body>Booked for a busy Saturday lunch.  The main room is beautiful and the whole place is a nice retreat from the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden outside.  Food was good - my choices were excellent although my wife didn&apos;t enjoy her main as the sauce / foam was rather out of place for a pork cheek dish.  Cheese board was amazing for desert.  Had a slightly comical incident with the wine which left our waiter visibly embarrassed and I am not sure he really recovered from that.  Didn&apos;t impact the meal.</body>

        <body>We had a table, just outside the courtyard central dining area and it was very nice. The food was excellent with a good choice, although we were there on a Sunday which meant there was limited choice.  There is a good atmosphere and makes for a great dining experience. The staff are friendly and attentive.</body>

        <body>Overall I was a bit disappointed with Clos Maggiore for what we paid.  The service was reasonably attentive - though the table we had was rather cramped and situated in such an awkward position that the waiters had to lean over us. The food was mixed - some of our party really enjoyed theirs but I was really disappointed: the scallops were slightly overcooked and my main was utterly bland.  Others have raved about this place, so hopefully our experience was a one-off, but I have eaten much better meals in central London for the same or less money!</body>

        <body>My wife and I were in London celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary.  We had time for dessert on our last night in town so we made last minute reservations at Clos Maggiore.   It was very romantic.  The ambiance is beautiful and intimate.  The desserts were very, very good.  And the service was excellent.   They even brought us out a plate with a candle, a few extra after dinner candies with &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot; written in chocolate on the plate.    We appreciated everything about our time there.</body>

        <body>Outstanding food, and presentation. Very nice, quality ambience. It&apos;s one of those places where you feel good dining. The service was impeccable. Visitors do have to  bear in mind that the restaurant does not have an a la carte menu for lunch, only a 3 or 4 course set menu option, which by the way is extremely good value for money. One of my favourite restaurants in London.</body>

        <body>This was a very popular and delightful place to have a pre-theatre/opera meal. It was very good value although had a very limited menu with a number of supplements.   The food was excellent and the pre selected wine quite acceptable. Would certainly go again.</body>

        <body>A lunch outing. The decor is top notch, very comfortable seating, faultless service. We opted for the tasting menu with wine pairing. The five courses we had were all well presented, an excellent standard of cooking from the kitchen. For me the best dish was the trout, my friend the pasta and mushroom dish from the vegetarian option. The  sommelier, very knowledgeable, went into  the reasoning  behind his pairings, our only disappointment was the Italian red with duck course. But that was the only negative point in the whole lunch !!</body>

Impeccable service, better than any other restaurant in our experience: friendly and attentive without being intrusive.

        <body>I booked in advance (In March) for our wedding anniversary in May.  Thankfully i got reservation in the conservatory upon request. We were treated with a special surprise of a neatly decorated chocolate plate with wishes written in chocolate :). My wife loved it. The food was out of the world especially the crab starter (I loved it!). Although would have loved to get a side table instead of the one right in the middle as it was our anniversary.   Overall i had a good time with my wife (Who was overwhelmed with my surprise) - Cheers!!!</body>

        <body>Enjoyed a really special lunch (set menu) for family birthday, pre theatre. Could not fault this lovely restaurant. Location was superb with on street parking for one of our party is disabled. Service was exemplary - great balance of being attentive and efficient without being too involved. Food was truly delicious and excellent value at £35 per head inc half bottle of (excellent) wine. Would highly recommend and will visit again.</body>

        <body>The ambience, detail to attention, and service were the first things we noticed; but then the food and wine pairings just blew us away.  What a wonderful restaurant!  We will be back.</body>

        <body>Really lovely night, service was impeccable. The wine list is like a book though and prices can elevate so if you&apos;re not a wine buff watch how much you spend! Best mashed potato I have had in my life (pinched from my boyfriends side order) and i don&apos;t normally even eat spuds!</body>

        <body>I booked the table for my bf birthday and it was just lovely, very welcoming receptionist took us upstairs where we had a lovely table by the fireplace. The food was delicious, I mean it was really good, slightly expensive but worth every penny ! The service was immaculate, very attentive and full of experience, answered for every questions and suggested great alternatives for the evening. The dessert wines are lovely, the decor was so romantic and peaceful atmosphere.  I will definitely recommend this place for special occasions or romantic dinner for two.</body>

        <body>My experience at clos maggiore was terrific. Having ate at Michelin stared establishments before I can honestly say this was a whole better experience.  The service from all the polite busy staff was nothing short of excellent. They wasn&apos;t too fussy they just made the evening flow nicely.  The atmosphere apart from having some snobs in the corner who wanted to tell everyone how posh they were and how much money they had was quite simply excellent. It gives you that feel that you are sat with a table in your front room gazing into your partners eyes.  Now the food. No long waits. Cooked to perfection. And can I say the slow cooked beef cheek was so succulent and tender that  it melted like butter  Wine list is tremendous and if you are a connisouir of fine wine then you will find some unique fine wines amongst the list. Tho me been a northern beer loving connisouir I opted for a nice French muscadet which complimented the delicious tasting food perfectly.   I genuinely think this restu</body>

        <body>Would highly recommend this restaurant. We enjoyed a set menu option although with only 3 choices for starter and mains we easily selected some exquisite dishes. Not too heavy for lunch either. We went for 2 course plus half bottle wine for £24.50 each. Wine was great. The service was impeccable and very friendly. The atmosphere was superb. Reminded me of the Ivy. White linen, wood panelled even the toilets were gorgeous!! We sat upstairs which could be used as a private dining room. Downstairs is the most gorgeous dining area where you feel you are seated outside. The whole ceiling is covered in blossom... It&apos;s beautiful!!  We will definitely be returning.</body>

        <body>By far the best restaurant I have personally ever been to.   I can&apos;t imagine a more perfect venue for a romantic meal in London.   The service has to be second to none, the staff were incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and seem to appear at the table exactly when they were required.   The food was amazing, with the portion sizes being just right. I would highly recommend the Wagyu beef.   The atmosphere was incredibly romantic especially amongst the climbing trees.   Defiantly one for Valentine&apos;s Day, an anniversary or an other special day for that matter.</body>

        <body>We ate here this weekend, we had the 5 course tasting menu matched with wines and it was delicious.  The staff were very knowledgeable about the wines and the service was good.  However I would only recommend going there if you are going to be seated in the conservatory area.  We knew we wouldn&apos;t be but I think that is possibly what makes it the amazing experience some write about.  Inside the restaurant it is quite a stuffy atmosphere and not really a fun experience although the food is delicious.  It feels a bit too hushed and over-formal. The food is amazing though and would highly recommend it if you are able to get seating in the conservatory.   We had a 5.00pm to 7.00pm slot but did not feel at all rushed as some people reported.  All in all a lovely meal but for the price I think you need the special atmosphere as well.</body>

        <body>We took friends to Clos Maggiore for a special birthday lunch.  They had never dined there before and were delighted with the whole experience, as were we.  The service was exceptional, friendly and professional and the food was excellent.  We ate in the conservatory which is very pretty and adds an extra pleasure to your meal.  I have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant.</body>

        <body>Just a stone&apos;s throw away from Covent Garden and Theatreland, the Clos Maggiore is well worth a visit. After attending a matinee performance at the ENO, we repaired there for an early supper on a cold February evening. We were given a warm welcome and dined extremely well on the &quot;pre-theatre&quot; set menu, which included a half bottle of very acceptable wine. Everything was beautifully cooked and presented and the service friendly and efficient. Whilst you might think twice about choosing from the a la carte menu, the pre-theatre menu represents excellent value for money in such a refined setting.</body>

        <body>Overall the meal was ok, however, the dining room was really hot and when I asked for the window to be opened it wasn&apos;t possible because another couple were sat right next to it and got cold.  I receive the wrong main course (duck instead of pork). I didn&apos;t change it because it was late and I didn&apos;t want to wait for it. I have no doubt that they would have changed it had I asked but then both me and my partner would have eaten alone.  The service was friendly, the food good in places and not so in others. The bill came to c£150 for 2 with including a £30 bottle of wine (which was recommended and was nice), which I didn&apos;t think was great value for the experience.</body>

        <body>Simply wonderful!! Great food, great venue, great service, great people. This was the perfect luncheon experience, and we were delighted. Don&apos;t worry about whether or not to dine upstairs or in the conservatory. Both were equally as lovely, and quite different. This was our first visit to Clos Maggiore, and we shall most definitely return. Highly recommended.</body>

        <body>My son and I had an enjoyable lunch to celebrate my birthday. The set menu with wine is excellent value for money and the food was well presented and delicious. Service was good. I ony booked the day before so we weren&apos;t seated in the conservatory, but it did look very beautiful and I can imagine it would be perfect for a romantic meal. Our table was ok, we were next to the bar and a little squashed but it is very popular so I&apos;d advise booking early to get the best tables. My only slight disappointment was that I had submitted a special request which was not acknowledged, however I do understand that the booking was only made the day before.</body>

        <body>First time at Clos maggiore and certainly will not be the last. The dining room was intimate and had a very calm ambience. Thumbs up to the interior designer it was surreal feeling, walking into the room transparent ceiling covered in branches with fairy lights. The duck foie gras terrine for starters was compact with amazing flavours and  the monkfish was perfectly cooked and tasted as good it was presented on the plate.The assortment of sorbet and ice cream for dessert topped of a beautiful evening. The service was second to none and very helpful when asked questions about the menu and wine list.</body>

        <body>Excellent service. The only reason we wouldn&apos;t return is that where we were sitting the tables were packed in so close together there was no privacy for conversation. Consequently not very relaxing. Plus we didn&apos;t order from the set menu and had to wait a long time for food.  For a restaurant of this standard there are better options in London.</body>

        <body>it is a beautiful place, there were a lot of staff when we arrived and even though 3 months booking in advance i was disappointed we were sat in the entrance part not the garden! the wine list id great but far to big 88 pages and the binder broke open on me so spent a good 10 mins trying to sort it out! we were asked what food we would like 5 times in 10 mins, after saying we are taking our time which felt very rushed indeed! our starter (duck) was delightful and served propt or main cod and pork cod was cooked perfect but seemed like a posh pealla more than anything else, the pork was great and a heafty portion no problem there! dessert: apple fondant- looked and tasted amazing 5 stars the tonca bean rice pudding was no so goos, i have had this in several places but i really did not like it at all, sour and over complicated, i had two tea spoons and didnt eat the rest! the waiter then came and said - &quot; did you not enjoy the rice pudding, it is a little strange not many like it&quot; which</body>

        <body>My boyfriend and I dined at Clos Maggoire on Monday 2nd March, we made the decision to visit there as we saw this restaurant on a programme with Heston about being the most romantic place to eat. On entrance we are greeted by a very welcoming smile and polite member of staff who showed us to our table straight away. Walking through the restaurant it was such a cosy, comfortable atmosphere and we felt at home, it reminded me of another restaurant I have visited in Lincolnshire called Wintringham fields. When we were taken to our table we were quite disappointed that we werent taken out into the conservatory to dine but I suspect we needed to book one of those tables specifically in advance. Our table was by far the worst positioned in the whole restaurant, we were almost in the aisle with all the waiters pacing up and down past us, ofter rocking the table which was quite discomforting and not as relaxing as expected the experience would have been. There were a huge amount of waiters fo</body>

        <body>As a foodie and Londoner, I am tired of restaurants that charge obscene rates for trendy food that looks great but never delivers on technique and flavour.  Clos Maggiore begins with good quality ingredients and creates intelligent dishes to bring out the best in every feature. We said goodbye to insipid brush strokes (there was one, but it delivered a punchy hoisin flavour), and were taken into the world of silken fois gras with a crisp ginger bread garnish. The  seabass, morels and peas were reminiscent of seaside weekends, whilst the grand finale peanut butter parfait, based on a PJ sandwich, took away every memory of cloying sickly bread and replaced it with something that danced on my tongue.  So is it worth the £55 tasting menu? To be honest, you could have the same experience by taking a trip to a French seaside, eating chinese take-out on the beach and then waiting 50 years for nostalgia to turn the memory into a poignant adventure, but for most of us, a meal in a comfortable </body>

        <body>I booked a table to dine here to celebrate my boyfriends 21st birthday. I could not have been more delighted with the service, food and atmosphere. We both agreed that we would recommend this to others who are looking for a fine dining experience to celebrate an occasion. We were both delighted with the delicious food, impecable service and beautiful interior.  One thing to note however is that I booked this table a month prior to the evening we attended (a Wednesday at 5pm). This was not early enough to secure a table inside the conservatory with the White flowers and fireplace. Therefore, if this is an area you wish to dine in, I would suggest booking far in advance!! Having said this, we were not disappointed because the area before it is beautiful too and the service and food blew us away.  Thank you to all at Clos Maggiore for such a special evening!</body>

        <body>The food was incredibly nice. I was afraid it wouldn&apos;t be enough to fill me up but was totally wrong, came out stuffed! Beautiful walk across the bar into the conservatory. Amazing ambience in the conservatory, and personally I really like that it was dimly lit in the night. The flowers looked even more incredible in real life than in the pictures. Table arrangement was so that I sat beside my partner and this added to the romantic feel of the restaurant. Everything was so clean, elegant and pretty. I definitely want to return sometime soon and try out more of their dishes.</body>

        <body>Great ambience, execellent food served by fanatstic people with the added bonus of a sense of humour! Not my first venture and it certainly will not be my last! A real treat and with good company well worth the money - especially for the set menu but no problem if anyone wants to go off piste - in more ways than one! Chefs Kitchen is very capable of adapting to your taste.  Can&apos;t praise them highly enough.  I have been to private parties upstairs, have dined upstairs too when no availabilty in the conservatory and the food and service is constant but conservatory is my favourite seating!  A must try if you never have !</body>

        <body>Good location, good service, but, pricey for quality of food. I think people get let down by the fact that they can&apos;t get seating in the conservatory, which is hyped up - main draw for so many people wanting to dine here. The space available is quite limited and needs to be booked well inadvance.</body>

        <body>Service is noticed as soon as you enter their door. Gracious welcome. Service all through our dining time, but not over done. We had a 7pm reservation and the restaurant already seemed full. We were served our main course promptly after enjoying our cocktails.  No appetizers as we were saving room for dessert. Quiet  yet attentive service while we ate then we were given some relaxing time before dessert was served.  This was well timed to digest our lamb and sea bass which were perfect in flavour and portion.   The peanut butter dessert with sorbet was an excellent way to end our dining experience.  A quiet atmosphere for a romantic dinner or a special night out with friends.  It was our 40th anniversary and it could have not been better.</body>

        <body>I booked a table for my boyfriends birthday.. We both love some fine dining for special occasions and love quaint little places that we can add to our gallery. As soon as we walked in, we both were taken aback by the romantic Tuscan villa esque conservatory with cherry blossom filling the room - the main attraction!!!  Every plate was presented with fine detail that makes you gasp in admiration but at the same time want to get stuck in and have a firework of flavour in your mouth. I had the the crab and wow was that fresh - just like eating a freshly picked crab in the villages of Italy by a fisherman and prepared by nonna. The fois gras melted and oozed with flavour making me wish there was more on my plate.., luckily the warm baked focaccia was these to tease me into main course... Iberico Pork and the Dover Mackarel ... Again, drum toll the ooohhhh and hmmmmm and yummmmms. I guess the only way you will appreciate my description of the peanut butter parfait is for you to take my wor</body>

        <body>Despite that the food we had was delicious.  Service was very good.  Just felt that the lunch menu was a little restricted. Although &quot;seasonal&quot; we didn&apos;t see any seasonal vegetables or food on the menu.</body>

        <body>The tradition of taking tea and that little bit of something between lunch and dinner has long since been a feature at Fortnum &amp; Mason. Our tranquil Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon was opened by HM The Queen and has since become a stylish destination for the most traditional of afternoon teas. </body>

        <body>Overall ok. For the price I expected a little more finesse and fewer back packs and coats on chairs and for the food to arrive with tea and not to have to chase replacement sandwiches. My waiter was excellent.</body>

        <body>For the price paid other establishments offer better value for money and service  The whole place seemed very busy and rushed  There was no silver service - as other establishments ie : no napkin unfolded for you / chair pulled out for lady  The choice of tea menus is too complex and too much choice  The China is not of good quality ( I was born and raised in the potteries ) so quite well versed on this  The ware has been through the dishwasher many times and is all worn - doesn&apos;t look that good ! Really needs attention  The selection of cakes and the quality was not impressive - pastry was hard and could not be broken with a cake fork  Scones were excellent as was the high grove champagne  Sandwiches were very bland and nothing exciting  I thought it was very expensive for what was offered. The same price is paid in many other venues in London and the food and experience and quality is higher. Service is also better. Harrods / Claridges and Kensington Palace and many hotels  offer a </body>

        <body>I booked a table for my mum - a late mother&apos;s day treat and she loved the whole experience.  The service was excellent and the food yummy.  We were not aware that the large cakes we were eyeing were included with the tea and because we were totally full up, the waitress offered to box slices of the chocolate cake up for us to take home.  The whole experience was far better than the tea we had at the Ritz.  I would highly recommend.</body>

        <body>We had a lovely  Afternoon Tea on a busy Sunday. The staff were curteous and the piono tinkled away in the foyer. The location is lovely and the food was too. My wife had the Savoury Afternoon Tea which she thought was great. I was unsure if we would get seconds but they were eventually offered as I progressed through the tea. My only criticism would  be that the staff seemed quite busy and rushed and could have offered seconds earlier. This is the only criticism I could make. Everything else was perfect.</body>

        <body>Took my mum for afternoon tea at fortnum&apos;s, it was lovely. Great selection of sandwiches and sweet treats. Serving scones with lemon curd was a delicious touch! We should have asked for more sandwiches as they were so lovely, but we didn&apos;t catch a waiters eye: by the time they came over to ask about top-ups we&apos;d already moved on! It is expensive, but with the piano playing in the background, the atmosphere matched the quality of the food - overall a wonderfully lovely afternoon.</body>

This was a lovely treat and I found good value , the setting is lovely and the service is very good, nice and friendly. We were offered sandwhich and cake refills which was very good .

        <body>We had no complaints on the food and tea but sadly the service wasn&apos;t as good as in similarly priced hotels in London. The waiter forgot to bring our sandwiches and cakes, we had to ask for more hot water and more tea on several occasions and we weren&apos;t offered to try different teas as you are in many other places.  It was good but I&apos;m not sure it was worth the money and service charge automatically added.</body>

        <body>This is the second time we visited the Fortnum and Mason tea salon. The first experience was outstanding with brilliant service. This second visit which was supposed to be a special treat for my brother and sister in law who were visiting from Belgium and at best, it was disappointing. We were rushed into making a decision on type of afternoon tea we wanted, without any explanation as to how the high tea process actually works. The savoury items were mediocre. The sweet tray was deposited on our table with no explanation by a different waiter, our tea was finished by this time and took 15 minutes and two requests to be topped up. The clotted cream was solidified to the extent that it was possible to use as a projectile to kill vermin. Overall:  Disappointing service by generally uninterested waiting staff and food which was not great - We were left 200 pounds poorer and very underwhelmed after our visit.</body>

        <body>This was my second visit and I took my mother for her first time. Our sitting was for 1415 and only had to wait for about 15 minutes to be seated....it is a very busy time but worth the wait.   We had the afternoon tea and it is surprisingly filling......a perfect pre theatre meal.   My first time there I was in the room on the left.......and this time we were in the room on the right......I would recommend requesting the room on the left as it is a bit more quiet. The room on the right has the kitchen at the back of the room and therefore has a lot of traffic and seemed noisier.   A nice touch is that you are allowed to take whatever sweets and cakes you aren&apos;t able to manage and the jams.   An overall nice experience.....and hope to go back again someday (in the room on the left!)</body>

        <body>We booked this as a special birthday treat, having had similar afternoon teas at The Dorchester and The Ritz in the past we were very much looking forward to our afternoon tea at Fortnum And Mason.We were made to wait 15 Minutes despite arriving on time but were eventually shown to our table.The menu options were not explained to us when the menus were brought to us by the waiter and even after we asked for help with the menu we were just told to pick one of the options on the menu, we were not offered any assistance choosing our  choice of tea.We ordered a glass of champagne which turned out to be a highlight but cost us an extra £14 each for the pleasure.When our food arrived we were disappointed that the bread on the sandwiches was dry as if the sandwiches had been left standing uncovered for some time, the second batch were much fresher.The scones were nice but unfortunately we did not think much of the mini cakes and never got offered the other cake that was being served to other</body>

        <body>We were a large group of eight celebrating my cousin&apos;s birthday. We were unfortunately left waiting for 20 minutes for our table (a miscommunication from/to the reception staff, I believe), however the staff could not have been more charming when I alerted them to the fact we were waiting, and we were shown to our table immediately and offered a complimentary bottle of champagne, which was an unnecessary but very much appreciated touch and put us in a lovely mood.  The room was uncomfortably warm, so I&apos;d suggest you wear layers! Luckily we were next to a window, so we took matters into our own hands and opened it. A bit naughty but the staff were so busy they didn&apos;t seem to mind.  We had - perhaps foolishly - eaten lunch, and had been expecting just to have a slice of cake or a scone and a cup of tea, but were told that was not possible, that we had to choose cake as part of the full afternoon tea (minimum £40 per head). Knowing from previous trips that the afternoon tea is enormous, </body>

        <body>The place is really nicely decorated, beautiful with live music (piano) . The  afternoon tea is really nice with some good sandwiches and some very good tea.  But I was very surprised and disturb by the noise with a table of 4 people (drunk?) laughing very loudely, that was very  surprising for me regarding this type of &quot;high level&quot; restaurant.  I was expecting to have a nice &quot;retreat&quot;/break  after a day of shopping in a nice place and it was like to be in a train station hall...Even if the food is good, I do not think that I will come back as I tested some more quiet place in London.</body>

        <body>My husband and I are afternoon tea veterans and we *thought* we had experienced some of the best in the land, but Fortnum &amp; Mason may well have surpassed them all to date.  We initially &apos;feared&apos; that it was going to be a parsimonious affair, as some establishments can be, but F&amp;M offered nothing of the sort. The food is very generous...*very* generous...the service was wonderful; so attentive and lovely...and the ambiance, from the pianist, was just right. The &apos;room&apos; is a delightful mixture of modern and classic (calming) style, an understated design which works beautifully.  We were not rushed in any way; we were offered more...and more...we felt truly welcome and we will definitely be returning in the (near!) future.</body>

        <body>While pricey the afternoon tea in the Jubilee Tea Salon is so worth it. Amazing service, beautiful surroundings and just yummy food. This was a highlight of our trip to London. The price is &quot;all you can eat&quot; but we couldn&apos;t even finish what was initially served to us. The staff is delightful and the people watching fun. A definite &quot;must do&quot;!</body>

        <body>We have no complaints about the food or the ambiance of the place but due to my own stupidity I did not check the bill before paying and as a result when we arrived home my wife found that we had been charged £10 for  Tea and Cake which we did not have. We just had the main Afternoon Tea with Vintage Champagne for two people, where this extra person came from I do not know and as it is a long way from home to go and complain I will put it down as reminder to put my reading glasses on and check the bill in future.</body>

        <body>I love tea at Fortnum and Mason and have been to the diamond tea room on at least five occasions in the last few years.The staff are very friendly and helpful and the room beautiful.Tea pot refills, cake and sandwich top up till your very full.All of which are very nice,but..and here&apos;s the but...the Tea service cutlery is clean but appalling,has been for a few years.  You can tell it was lovely and probably expensive when first used,but on each returning visit it seems to be getting tattier without new replacements.The gilt rims on the tea pots and cups are worn away,chips to teapot lids and plates on several occasions,the plated cutlery looks to need replacing and the poor thin cake stands are wobbly and bent.  On this occasion I had taken my mother as a treat on her birthday and felt a little ashamed I hadn&apos;t taken her somewhere else,as she pointed out the tatty state of the table wear.It was still a lovely spread but I will wait till they replace the tea sets before taking anyone t</body>

        <body>Hi visited the tea rooms for my husbands birthday but I do believe the value is not good enough for a high class London afternoon tea. Having been to many places for high tea this experience comes below all other 8. The cakes are not as good as other places and the sandwiches are again not as good quality as the Sanderson even. Please don&apos;t waste your money our bill was over 200! Go to the Ritz.</body>

        <body>An excellent birthday celebration for 60 years young.  The staff were present, but not intrusive.  Our waitress spotted that it was a birthday celebration and asked if we would like a slice of cake with a candle brought out, it wasn&apos;t showy or embarrassing, just quietly brought out, which my dad really appreciated.  The ambience from the piano players was fantastic, even spotting my three girls watching and moving seamlessly into Twinkle Twinkle, then back into the set piece.  My only disappointment was that, as a huge cake fan, I was too poorly on the day to eat more than half a scone.  I am so devastated!!  It was just a cold, nothing serious, and it didn&apos;t spoil my enjoyment or that of the rest of the party, I just really feel I missed out on those delicious looking cakes (and the other half of my scone).  We all had a really lovely time.  Thank you.</body>

        <body>Firstly due to a few bad reviews regarding service, I was abit concerned as this was booked for a special occasion, but could not fault the service. We were made to feel very welcome and our waitress , did not get her name but was from Italy, was absolutely brilliant, very quick with bringing our teas and recommending and took an interest on what we like and sandwiches and cakes and scones , clotted cream just kept coming and then a nice gentleman came over and said make sure you make room for the selection of the larger cakes they had on display on cake stands, we could not believe the amount on offer, so go really hungry lots to eat.</body>

        <body>My family and I are Americans who live and work in Munich. When we decided to go to London over my birthday weekend, we were looking for something extra special to do. My daughter was also dying to do a &quot;real English tea&quot; as a lot of her friends at her international school are Brittish. I asked on the school&apos;s parent facebook page what was best place for a true tea in London. Several were mentioned, but Fortnum and Mason was mentioned numerous times.  The online booking was very easy and it was one of the things we were most looking forward to about our trip.  It lived up to all of our expectations and more. The salon itself is so beautiful. The staff so friendly and courteous. The food was delicious, as was the tea (and it was the first time I added milk and sugar and I must say, you all are on to something!)  The entire experience will be something we remember forever. It was such a memorable occiasion and a very special birthday.</body>

        <body>Overall, we enjoyed our experience having Afternoon Tea at Fortnum and Mason. However, there were a few things that made the experience less than desirable, especially considering the hefty price tag. First, we arrived five minutes before our reservation time, but we were not seated until TWENTY minutes AFTER our reservation time!! I was pretty annoyed - isn&apos;t this supposed to be a five-star restaurant? The servers and hostesses were running around like this was their first time dealing with a busy day.   Once we were finally seated, it was quite apparent that they were under-staffed, as the service was overall quite slow. Despite several eye-contacts with our server, it took quite a while for him to take our order (he had probably six other tables?!?). We ordered the afternoon tea for my mother and myself, and the children&apos;s tea for my daughter. We also ordered two champagnes. We received the champagne quickly, but no tea. Even after we received the food, we still had no tea!! I had </body>

        <body>I&apos;ve had afternoon tea at the F&amp;M Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon a number of times now (usually when friends and family are visiting from out of town) and this is the first time I&apos;ve not been proud of the service. The food (especially the individual dishes for the High Tea) are excellent and the scones and cakes are delicious, but the service was spotty this time around. This is the first time I&apos;ve gone so late (17.30h) and it almost felt like they were trying to tidy-up for the night and then rush us out the door at the end.  Some of the finger sandwiches seemed as if they were not freshly made. We were not offered seconds of anything and we were left on our own for long periods of time. Our water glasses were not refilled and we had to flag someone down to ask for more tea. Other than these small complaints, it was still a beautiful and delicious experience. We were able to take a slice of cake home with us. Some of the teas are just wonderful and they offer incredible value.</body>

        <body>We booked an afternoon tea at Fortnum &amp; Mason Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon as part of a birthday celebration, and unfortunately we were pretty disappointed with the experience. As Fortnum&apos;s is considered a luxury experience, we were expecting good service and good food, and sadly it just did not live up to expectations.  On arrival (and despite arriving early) we had to wait a while to be seated. The Front of House staff seemed flustered, and as if they were struggling to deal with the volume of people.  When we were finally seated, it took a long time for someone to come over and take our order (this happened only after we had waved our hands in the air in an attempt to grab their attention), and then quite frankly the waiter seemed bored and fairly uninterested in taking our order.  The food did arrive fairly promptly, and we were pleased to find out that we could order additional cakes and sandwiches for no extra charge. However when we did, these took a long time to arrive. One of ou</body>

        <body>We were making a special trip to &apos;do London&apos; with our children (10 and 14). They enjoy an afternoon tea and a friend recommended Fortnum &amp; Mason.  We knew the prices were high but thought it would be worth it since it came with such a high reputation and recommendation.  We did not get off to a good start as we were kept waiting 15 minutes for our table even though we had a booked time slot.  The restaurant/tea room itself are lovely and just what we would had hoped.  The tea itself was average.  The children enjoyed their tea but after we had our savouries we were left waiting for 25 minutes before having to wave for attention and request our cakes and scones.  We were told they were on their way.  Another 5 minutes passed, they appeared: 2 tiny scones each and some tiny pastries on top.  I also requested a fresh pot of tea as mine had gone cold waiting for the cakes. This was replaced quickly.  We asked for the bill after another 20 minutes and were then offered some more sandwiches</body>

        <body>We  loved the atmosphere of the Jubilee tea room– so welcoming and relaxing- it was lovely to listen to the accomplished pianists too.  We chose the High tea and were impressed by the choice of dishes and the service throughout.  The presentation and quality of the food made the whole experience a joy.  The staff were helpful, friendly  and attentive without being intrusive.  We would definitely recommend Fortnum &amp; Mason - after all we all deserve a bit of luxury :)</body>

        <body>I was catching up with an old friend over tea. The tea Solon was very busy and we experienced a slight wait at the beginning. Once we were seated the service commenced. The selections were delicious, our waiter was attentive and helpful, and we were able to have our tea refreshed and sandwiches topped up with ease. All in all,  a very pleasant afternoon.</body>

        <body>A great experience with lovely food and ambience. We were given a choice of table to sit (the restaurant was almost full on the Friday afternoon) and chose a table with a view of the piano and live music. Overall, we were very happy. The only small criticisms being that it took a while to get replacement teas and sandwiches, and that refilling the tea pots with water instead of with fresh loose tea resulted in the 2nd pot being rather weak.</body>

        <body>Absolutely fantastic surroundings and service! A girlfriend and I had one savoury and one sweet tea. Both were stunning,  we booked a table for 4.45pm which gave us a good couple of hours to enjoy our tea before strolling, stuffed to the theatre.</body>

        <body>Lovely afternoon until a strange hair was found in one of the pastries (and it did not belong to me)! Surprisingly, staff were unapologetic and no concession was offered as a result. Needless to say, I will not be going back.</body>

        <body>Absolutely loved our Afternoon Tea with Fortnum and Mason. It seems obscene to rate a £44 tea as good value but the quality was exceptional and there appeared to be unlimited refils of every element. Staff could not do enough for us and the environment was unobtrusive. Five stars across the board.</body>

        <body>Whilst the service was attentive it was, at times, a little slow  and the tea rooms were not overly busy.  The selection of sandwiches were very good and the gluten-free bread impressed my gluten-intolerant guest.  Only two preserves were served with the scones - though several more were listed on the menu; on previous visits all varieties were served.  The patisseries were fabulous as were the cakes from the carriage. A superb selection of single estate teas, and our waiter&apos;s knowledge of the varieties was excellent in assisting our choices.</body>

Could easily sit there all day , was not rushed and the atmosphere with the piano playing was beautiful.

        <body>Wonderful experience and tea! The salon is all decked out in Tiffany blue- the fine china and sterling flatware lets you know right away that you are in for a treat! The Steinway grand piano and beautiful playing set the mood straight away. Delicious food and the scones were by far the best I have ever had. I only wish I could taste them again today!</body>

        <body>Premier séjour à Londres, pour mon anniversaire je voulais le fêter d&apos;une manière spéciale: un vrai tea time anglais. Après une journée de visites et beaucoup de marche, nous arrivons devant Fortnum &amp; Mason. Nous faisons quelques achats et direction le Diamond Jubilee Teas Salon. Nous étions en avance d&apos;un quart d&apos;heure, aussi l&apos;hôtesse d&apos;accueil nous a gentiment fait patienter; 5 minutes après nous étions à notre table. Une hôtesse française (quel bonheur pour des français parlant assez mal anglais) nous a donné les explications nécessaires pour parfaire notre choix. Personnellement j&apos;avais choisi l&apos;afternoon tea time classique, avec un thé blanc au jasmin. Tout était parfait.  J&apos;ai tout aimé, les scones avec la clotted cream et la confiture de fraise ont été une révélation: quelle merveille! Et que dire du thé, une expérience unique, quel bonheur de découvrir des saveurs rares. Nous avons passé un merveilleux moment de luxe, calme et volupté! Quand sommes parti notre fatigue de la j</body>

        <body>We had afternoon tea and a couple of bottles of champagne at F&amp;M&apos;s Diamond Jubilee tea salon. The service was good and they catered well for dietary requirements, although they could have been a bit more attentive.  Felt like I kept having to get the attention of staff who were trying to avoid us rather than the staff keeping an eye out to ensure we were ok. The sandwiches were good and scones lovely but wouldn&apos;t get too excited about the cakes.  Champers was lovely. Would still recommend although I think there are probably better options for a good, luxurious afternoon tea in London.</body>

        <body>I have done a few afternoon teas in establishments in London and elsewhere and this has to have been one of the best that I have done!  The food is fabulous and our server kept on bringing as much as we could eat!  They even packed up the food that we couldn&apos;t finish for us to take away with us.  One point that I would make is that the reception / booking in system didn&apos;t appear to be very well organised as we arrived.  However, once we were seated, everything else was brilliant and overall was an excellent experience.</body>

        <body>When we arrived we were asked to wait in the corner of the reception area where we remained for 20 mins past our reservation time. No one explained the delay or even apologised until they took us to the table.  Once at the table ( no one asked for coats or pointed out out a cloakroom ) we were given menus and then left for nearly 15 mins .  Not a good start! However when the waiter finally returned he was very helpful and attentive,returning a number of times and checking we were ok and replenishing our tea.After an hour and half we ccouldn&apos;t get anyones attention for love nor money! Exactly 2 hours after getting to the table we were asked to vacate it. To be fair when i pointed out the issues they were happy to bring another pot of tea for each of us and were happy for  bus to stay longer. Overall the food and atmosphere  were lovely but we all felt that sometimes the service lacked the special touches we expected.</body>

        <body>A mixture of spilt tea at the table, delivering us the wrong tea late to the table and only warm was disappointing. Sandwiches had been made some time earlier and were dry. We were not advised on tea selection or preserves. The staff tried to be attentive but had no time to do so. Sadly the dress code for F&amp;M was too relaxed. We did not expect to see clients in shorts and tee shirts. Very disappointed.</body>

        <body>We booked for 6 pm, but it was closer to 6 30 pm by the time we actually sat down. I waitress did her best, but she was clearly incredibly busy. A very frenetic atmosphere. We were offered extra sandwiches. Sounded good, yes please. But they took well over half an hour to arrive.  All in all, for the money, a very disappointing experience.  The manager apologised, and he removed the service charge. It was the least he could do.</body>

        <body>Having had afternoon tea at several big names before such as The Ritz and The Savoy, my sister and I decided to try out Fortnum and Mason. There were plenty of time slots available when booking the table, which gave a refreshing flexibility we hadn&apos;t experienced at other establishments where you have to book months in advance. The ambience was fantastic-there was a pianist playing and the room where the tea was served was the height of elegance. We ordered high tea, with eggs Benedict replacing sandwiches as with the standard afternoon tea and it was the best eggs Benedict I have ever tasted. They also allowed me to have hot chocolate rather than tea at no extra cost and still brought it out in a delightful individual tea pot, allowing for two cups to be poured! We were informed that all patisseries and scones were replenishible and what delicious scones and cakes they were. The scones were served warm and the patisseries were nice and varied in flavour and type of pastry etc. Our wai</body>

        <body>I took my nine year old granddaughter to afternoon tea as a special treat. The venue advertises as &apos;child friendly&apos; and indeed it is with a child&apos;s menu for tea at a reduced cost for those  interested. It is still elegant but with slightly reduced quantities and options other than tea to drink. The place was very busy. We arrived slightly early and had to wait for slightly longer than our booked time. Once seated, service was a bit slow to start and we seemed not to have been noticed for quite a while. I had read reviews about slow service at this venue so waited with interest to be served! However, once a waiter saw us as he was walking by, the service improved considerably.   The whole experience was extremely pleasant once things got going and I was pleased for my granddaughter who absolutely loved it. What were unable to eat was boxed beautifully for us to bring home.</body>

        <body>I was disappointed to see that  while I understood that there was a dress code for the tea salon, there gwere patrons wearing work style boots &amp; flip-flops.   In my opinion this is not smart casual attire. Nevertheless, it was a lovely afternoon tea experience.</body>

        <body>There were enough people working in this tea house, however, their service was not as attentive as it should be.  We always have to be waited to refill the hot water for our tea.  Further more, staffs are not that helpful, they&apos;ve forgotten some of our clothes in the cloak room and one of the waitresses told us just go to the reception and asked for it by ourselves.  The overall experience is not bad with the very cosy embience.  We were sitting near the entrance and found that the live piano playing was a bit too loud for our chatting.  The store on the ground floor was amazing, would definitely go back for it.</body>

        <body>From the beginning of our reservation through to the end the staff were absolutely wonderful and so accommodating! I had made the reservations for my sister and I (having flown in from 2 different parts of the world) to celebrate her 40th birthday. We enjoyed the afternoon tea....it was incredible. The staff are attentive and walk you through the experience and were extremely helpful and welcoming of my 15 month old nephew. From the beautiful ambiance, to the tea service and china...followed by a shopping experience that is bar none...Fortnum and Mason is an experience to be had by all! A must do when in London.</body>

        <body>We took my Mum in law for her birthday as a treat and to say thank you. We had our 3 teenage sons with us and it was fun for them too. HOwever, I thought that the food/cakes were overly complicated, with some very different flavours and also almost all containing nuts. More plain scones; more simpler, delicious cakes would have been perfect. The treats, specially the top plate contained things such as jelly, marshmallow, nuts and or quite sophisticated flavours which were too much for elderly or young palates. I love tasty,m unusual food, but these were unnecessarily complicated, trying to be different. If you take your children, be aware that there will be no simple chocolate eclairs or scones!</body>

        <body>We were made to wait 10mins in the corner of the room before we had to go and remind them that we were still waiting.  Whilst they acknowledged they hadn&apos;t forgotten about us, we weren&apos;t given a timescale to which we were going to have to wait further.  we stood for 15mins before being shown to our table.  This was in spite of the fact that I had confirmed the booking twice at that stage.  Food was lovely and our waitress was very attentive.  What should have been explained was that we could have had more sandwiches for example or scones if we wanted - when we were asked if we wanted more, we had already moved onto the next part of the afternoon tea.  Granted that this is Fortnum and Mason and in London, I still feel that the price is very high for what we got, and the addition of 12.5% service charge is very high.  I can make up my own mind on how much I wish to tip in direct response to how I am treated and don&apos;t believe that adding service charges are appropriate.  Was nice as a sp</body>

        <body>Enjoyed High Tea with my husband and friends and felt welcome the moment we arrived. Beautiful interior and there was a gentleman playing the piano in the reception area which was a nice touch. As a first timer in London we all wanted to experience a British tradition and Fortnum &amp; Mason definitely delivered. I ordered the High Tea and ate the Scotch Egg and my husband had the lobster omlette. Both were delicious. The scones with clotted cream and jams were divine, as we&apos;re the pastries and cakes. The tea recommended by our waiter really matched the food we ate. Everyone was friendly and we were made to feel special and comfortable. I highly recommend the Diamond Jubilee Room.</body>

        <body>My fiancee, my mum, my dad and I went to Fortnum and Mason the 23rd of May at 4.30 pm (a Saturday). The first table we were seated at were quite wide and the piano was too loud to hear what people said. We asked if we could change tables and she found us a better table a bit further away from the live piano music. We had a wonderful glass of champagne meanwhile because we had to wait (although I had been promised a free glass of champagne anyway since they moved our reservation from 4pm to 4.30 pm because their booking system had taken too many costumers in, so I expected it anyway... But it was still very nice!).  The staff was very friendly and helpful. The afternoon tea was absolutely perfect (we had 3 times the savory afternoon tea and 1 had the afternoon high tea). The cakes and sandwiched were unlimited which made us feel like good value for money :)  Overall a very good experience, and I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who would like a great experience and love</body>

        <body>Fortnum and Mason is one of the iconic places to have an afternoon tea in London and we all had very high expectations. The selection of teas was awesome and the food (we went for the High Tea) delicious but the service was disappointing and that&apos;s why I&apos;ve only given them three stars. For 44 pounds per person you expect impeccable service and we did not get that, we had a reservation for 6pm but we were not seated until 6.30pm even though there were plenty of empty tables.</body>

        <body>We went for afternoon tea.  Our server forgot to bring the tea.  We got our food promptly.  By the time we were able to bring to  our servers attention  our missing tea, it had gotten cold sitting on the counter.  This started the tea process all over again.  We had finished our food by the time we got hot tea.  Very disappointing.</body>

        <body>I ended up booking afternoon tea at Fortnum &amp; Mason after failing to find a table at Ritz  as, I wanted to offer a five star tea experience to my sister . We were both impressed from the moment we stepped in ; the ambience , the attention to detail ( the floral arrangement, the pianist , the layout of the tables) , the service, the food,  were all outstanding. I will happily book  again a table before going to a concert in London . A special thank you to the manager, Sebastian , for the way he made our experience a wonderful one.</body>

        <body>My sister and I booked the Tea Salon as a Birthday treat for our Mother and I have to say it didn&apos;t disappoint. The service was friendly and our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing. We had the Afternoon Tea, which was lovely, the food was to a high standard and the cakes were delicious, especially the rose éclair. My Mother even received a slice of chocolate Birthday cake at the end of the visit. I will definitely be visiting the Tea Salon again.</body>

        <body>The Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon is an airy restaurant with fresh looking tables spaced well apart from one another so one doesn&apos;t  overhear others&apos; conversations as can sometimes be the case in a more tightly packed restaurant. I had taken my daughter here for her 18th birthday and liked it enough to invite a friend as a 50th birthday treat. We had a pleasant time but the experience was not nearly as good as my first. We arrived punctually for our 3.15pm booking but our table was not ready and we were left waiting for several minutes. My friend has some food allergies and had phoned ahead to arrange a certain set of sandwiches that would suit her. She was assured that there would be no difficulty with this, and there wasn&apos;t, but her request had not been recorded and she therefore had to make it again from scratch to the waiter. Initially we were served quickly but after offering to refresh our plates of sandwiches, our waiter did not bring them and we waited 15 minutes, summoning a diff</body>

        <body>I had afternoon tea here for my birthday a few days ago – we were a group of 15 across two tables. I had been before with just my husband and had an amazing time which is why I wanted to go back. The decor, the food &amp; the presentation were all great. However – the service was diabolical! Incredibly slow – we literally had to ask for everything and did not feel waited on at all. Which for the price you pay is just not good enough. I&apos;m not sure if we just were unlucky on the day or the waiting staff happened to be new or that they just cannot cater for a group booking but I am in the process of complaining to F&amp;M which is a real shame because the food was good.</body>

        <body>Have tried many different luxury afternoon teas and this was the poorest one to date. I would recommend The Ritz or Claridges for quality and value for money.  The bread on the outside sandwiches was dry, the mini cake selection was below average (I do not consider mini eclair as a luxury cake), but the scones were light and delicious.</body>

        <body>I took my daughter here for afternoon tea. From start to finish, the service was superb. The tea was wonderful. The food was scrumptious! It was a memorable experience for us. I will definitely return on my next trip to London and will highly recommend it to friends and family.  On a different note, after we left the Tea Salon, we went shopping in the store and had a negative experience with another customer in the store. As I was speaking with a salesperson in the store, I was mocked by the customer as she walked by. It left me with a bad impression. I do hope that most Americans feel welcome in London, because I certainly didn&apos;t in this instance.</body>

        <body>Booked as a special treat for my mum. I love shopping at fortnums so decided to have afternoon tea which we have never done. Since my children have been of Easter egg hunting age I buy special eggs every year. I love supporting British producers and fortnums encapsulates this. Food on the afternoon tea was all of top quality and well made. However I am a stickler for presentation. I had my tea served in a chipped tea pot! This was the only point of which the whole experience could be criticism.</body>

        <body>I was at the Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon on a Sunday afternoon. I have tried quite a few tea salons in London and this was definitely in top 3. Great tea selection, delicious food and very good service en general. The only negative thing was that there was a big party in the other salon which meant a great deal of noise in the beginning until the party was seated. But overall a great experience, will definitely come back another time.</body>

        <body>It was a lovely experience and the food was surprisingly filling. We were not hurried out and stayed for nearly three hours enjoying the ambience. Our waiter was excellent; attentive but not imposing. The only thing we were unhappy with was the fact that the waiting staff apparently received very little of the gratuity that had been added on to the bill. As it said &apos;discretionary&apos; we opted to have it removed, and left ours in cash which apparantly went into a &apos;pot&apos; to be shared. A small point but we felt it was important. To conclude, a lovely experience for that special occasion, especially when it is a surprise.</body>

        <body>My two friends joined my husband and I at the Jubilee Tea Salon for my significant birthday. From the moment of our arrival, everything was perfect. The Champagne was elegantly served. The Tea tasting at the table was a charming addition. We were thrilled with the choice of tea menus, including High Tea &amp; Savoury Tea. The servings were generous and delicious. Having grown-up in a colonial tea plantation, this was exactly how Tea was served during those halcyon days! Most relaxing and not-rushed and spacious. A perfect afternoon of celebration......and the service was outstanding.</body>

We also love the selection of teas. I always selection Chai and my daughter selects a different one on each visit, all of them have a lovely flavour.</body>

        <body>My daughter and I met up with London friends here to catch up. What I liked the most was the un-rushed atmosphere and the way the staff allowed us to enjoy a  leisurely tea for our visit. Very special time. Wonderul place.</body>

        <body>I couldn&apos;t speak more highly of the service we received during our Bridal Shower Afternoon Tea at Fortnum &amp; Mason. Every detail from the china to the waiting staff was impeccable. We were particularly taken by the efforts to ensure one guest received a gluten and dairy free menu printed on exactly the same letterhead without any fuss at all. Fortnum &amp; Mason really look out for the little details and deliver. The only tiny remark would be that we wish we&apos;d been encouraged to take our chosen slide from the dessert trolley home though we ere too full to eat anything at the time.   A real must if you have the opportunity. Thank you!</body>

        <body>I booked fortnum for afternoon tea for my sister in law and I who was travelling in from Canada to spend a few days with us in the uk. I have been to tea before but my sister in law wanted to experience high tea as this was something they&apos;d often heard of but not tried. We had a very warm and welcoming experience, not only did we catch up on life but we had the added pleasure of yummy sandwiches, plain and sultana scones and a plate of luxury cakes, which we couldn&apos;t finish and were allowed to bring home as a treat. Will definitely be going back.</body>

        <body>i took my partner here for his birthday, and chose the vegetarian option (difficult finding afternoon tea for veggies). It was fantastic. The staff were lovely and welcoming and the sandwiches,scones and cakes were delicious. It was really nice to have a variety of vegetarian sandwiches and not made to feel awkward.   We were so stuffed that we couldn&apos;t manage the final cake course - but the staff let us choose a cake anyhow which they wrapped up for us to take home.   Definitely coming again!</body>

        <body>Have been to Fortnum &amp; Masons 3 times now and it gets better and better every time. After second visit we tried The Savoy and  I must say I was so dissapointed with the experience much prefer F&amp;M by a mile. The food was very tasty to start with the sandwiches  were iymmi iymmi esoecialy the prawn with gem lettuce and as I dont drink tea I had fresh apple juice, the nicest I have ever tasted. All of which were replenished to no end..only criticism was a little bit of the service. When Asked what tea we wanted and my friend asked nerest to english tea he did not know which one was do wshe opted for afternoon blend then my 16 yr old daughter asked for the same and was told no you dont want the same choose domething else!!!!  The I asked for apple juice as I dont drink tea or coffee he said what you dont eant tea!! Coffee or hot chocolate? No thank you I asked for Apple juice!!  Then when asked about special diet I requested my daughters sandwiches not to contain butter as she us Autistic</body>

        <body>The service was what really made this experience - the staff were exeptional and attentive. The food was good and the flavours of the different treats and cakes were outstanding.  However I felt the price per head wasn&apos;t on the high side although you were offered plenty of top ups of both food and tea. Well worth a visit for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>This was my second visit to F&amp;M for afternoon tea. Having tried many others in London hotels I would say this is  my favorite.  the rooms are beautiful, service excellent and without any attitude.  It has the added advantage that you can browse the store before or after and spend the whole afternoon in there. I will definitely be back.  The only slight disappointment was on my first visit we had a round corner table set out so that both of us faced the room and on my second visit we were face to face at a square table where I had my back to the room and was facing the kitchen entrance so I couldn&apos;t enjoy the full experience/people watching etc.  I really think that it would be better to set those tables so diners are sitting perpendicular to each other so both could see the room.</body>

        <body>We came here for afternoon tea as we had a gift card. We were seated promptly and made our choices. The food arrived almost immediately and we were informed that everything was replenishable - sandwiches, sweets and scones. We did order a second round of sandwiches as they were so delicious! There was a lobster roll on the sandwich stand which I loved. The scones were superb as well and I appreciated that we received a good portion of clotted cream with them, as opposed to many other places. When we tried the sweets we were already so full that we didn&apos;t finish them and didn&apos;t order anything off the cake tray. I liked the sweets but they did not blow my mind - I&apos;m not a huge fan of &quot;neoclassical&quot; patisserie and most of the items had a somewhat unusual ingredient in them (rose, green tea, this kind of thing - I know, I&apos;m boring) so I wasn&apos;t too sad that I couldn&apos;t eat any more. Quality was excellent nonetheless and I cannot emphasise enough how great the service was - our waiter (a you</body>

        <body>Arriving there they had our booking for half an hour later on their system! Though i had 2 confirmation emails with the correct time. We had to wait 20mins to be seated. The food was alright, yet they don&apos;t pay attention for refilling the teapot as soon as it is empty. The atmosphere is very decent though; but i had much better tea experiences elsewhere.</body>

        <body>We booked afternoon tea at fortnum&apos;s for my daughter&apos;s 7th birthday treat. Upon arrival we had a short wait and then we&apos;re shown to our table which was lovely and big for the four of us. I chose the traditional tea which was fantastic, the sandwiches were beautifully fresh and had plenty of filling and we&apos;re replenishable so we had three helpings! My husband doesn&apos;t have a sweet tooth so he went for the scotch egg with piccalilli which was delicious with a soft runny egg in the middle. Both my daughters had the child&apos;s tea which they really enjoyed. All of which was replenishable too. My daughter was recommended a strawberry infused tea brought over in her very own tea pot which she loved! At the end of our tea, the pianist played happy birthday and the brought my daughter a slice of chocolate cake with a candle in it. A lovely touch! She was so full up they wrapped up the cake beautifully for her to take home.  I had a pot of countess grey tea which was beautifully delicate and citru</body>

        <body>Before our recent visit to London, I reserved a table for Afternoon Tea at Fortnum &amp; Mason in the Diamond Jubilee Tearoom.  Although I booked several activities around London for our  visit, all of which were excellent choices, I looked forward to our visit to Fortnum &amp; Mason more than any other.   This was our third trip to Fortnum &amp; Mason for Afternoon Tea over the years.  We included our young children and a group of high school students in the past, but this was just for my husband and me so we could celebrate our big birthday year.  We were treated like royalty and everything we were served was absolutely delicious.  There is no other way to describe it!  We ordered four different  teas throughout the meal and all of them were perfect.  We chose the High Tea option and considered it our dinner.  I ordered Scotch Eggs.  I had always wondered what they were and the dish was scrumptious.  The scones were served with a variety of jams and lemon curd and we took the partially empty ja</body>

        <body>Our experience was overall good! The venue was nice, the tables were spaced out and our table was near the window so good view of Piccadilly!    The food was very good and from the start the waitress who was very nice advised that we could ask for repeat food or tea. We did, as each tray had small portions.  I feel the slow service (management issue) let down the overall experience.  The service was very slow, one of the guests asked for a coffee instead of tea (we were told that coffee was served as well), yet it took about 40 minutes for a cold coffee to arrive! (Each time)!! Your waitress did her best.   I hope the management of this restaurant takes a note of my last comment and remedies this service.  The product is good, your waitresses brilliant but the service is lacking in good time management and a decent coffee machine. Thank you.</body>

        <body>We celebrated our daughters 21st birthday with tea.  The setting is gorgeous, and it is a very special experience.  However, the service was lacking.  The staff did not explain our options for the different teas.  Had they done that we would have ordered differently.  It took a while to be acknowledged, and for them to &quot;check in&quot;.  For the amount of money this is the staff should be more attentive.  Because of that I would suggest to friends that they go someplace for a special tea when visiting London but perhaps not Fortnum &amp; Mason.</body>

        <body>My 10-y.o. Daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed afternoon tea  at Fortnum &amp;  Mason&apos;s.  We had a reservation, were seated promptly and received good service.  My daughter was uncertain if which tea she wated - the waiter explained the choices well and then suggested that she try both - which she did! I had noted on our reservation that this was a birthday treat for her.    Near the end of our visit, the pianist played &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; as the waiter brought a slice of chocolate cake with a candle.   It was super-nice.</body>

        <body>we had afternoon tea on Friday, Monday today and yet the character was such that we shall enjoy remembering it for a long time.  having been an hotel manager for 20 years (career change to college lecturer) I appreciate what makes for good service, I compliment Fortnum &amp; Masons - I had no thought to recognize fault, one knows when something is done as it should be - it was. Our waiter was politeness, friendliness and  dexterity personified, I would have employed him on the spot if still an hotel manager. of course the tea and accompaniments were as good as would be expected and we celebrated them. thank you for a beautiful afternoon.</body>

        <body>Loved it.The entire experience on this visit was very good . The restaurant is  light and airy . We were seated promptly. Our food was replenished regularly without us having to ask, which was a a great bonus. I hate asking !The list of teas is great and i had the Countess Earl Grey with a nice flavour of orange , yum. My friend had the savoury tea and i had the sweet one so we could taste each others food and i like them both.  The scones and cakes were  so fresh and delicate, and the preserves were of course Fortnum and Mason’s very own .   Next week it&apos;s my birthday and they made a surprise with a candle lit in a piece of cake and piano singing Happy Birthday , i was speechless.   Overall a good choice for afternoon tea when in London.</body>

        <body>After hearing that this was a great place to take out of towners for &apos;high tea&apos;, I was quite disappointed considering the price of £44! The service was slow and we were the first table of only 3 to be seated at 12 noon!! There were plenty of staff around but they were not attentive, they didn&apos;t appear to notice if we were in need/ want service?!  The tea was only topped up with hot water and not given a fresh pot?! So it was quite frankly gross. The scones and sandwiches were fresh, delicious and varied - certainly the best part of the food!. The Victoria Sponge was certainly a day old as the actual sponge cake was hard.  This place does have all the right settings for a great meal. The decor all works really well together but the staff are poorly trained. I would rather have less staff that know what they are supposed to be doing than too many that have no idea. I was very disappointed with this experience as a whole, considering you are in F&amp;M I believe the standard should be much m</body>

        <body>Afternoon Tea was of a good standard as usual with  a great selection provided for the 2 Gluten-Free members of our party of 5. Waitress was friendly and helpful, despite not recording one of our choices of tea accurately. Position of table was disappointing as - for the third time - we were stuck on the bench seats by the entrance and lift, amidst the traffic and waiting area with no view, which detracted from the ambience and experience. Tea here is expensive for the group of 5 we comprised and, due to the poor position, we felt that we were unable to experience the full Tea Salon experience (again) - which is half of it at this location. In the future, we will either look for some confirmation of a better table position or go elsewhere.</body>

        <body>It was a beautiful place, beautiful tea set. The little sandwiches, scones, and pastries were so delicious. I was pretty sure I would leave this place still hungry because you don&apos;t think little sandwiches would fill you up, but I was WRONG. I left there soooo full! It is definitely worth it even though some people may think 40 pounds is a lot. You get the full experience &amp; the food is wonderful. GO!</body>

        <body>Fortnum and Mason has to me simply got it right, by which I mean the atmosphere, quality of service as well as the sandwiches, cakes and fancies on offer. It has an air of quality without being stiff and stuffy, and that&apos;s why I like it so much. I also really appreciated the fact that I could take home all the cakes we couldn&apos;t finish, and thus share the joy with those left at home ... I will definitely be going again...</body>

        <body>Been here for afternoon tea many times, it&apos;s always lovely but I must sadly say the service wasn&apos;t up to the normal high standard on this occasion. The food was excellent, cakes superb but had to ask few times for water refills, the food came before the tea. One of the waiters seemed to huff when we requested a few more of the coronation chicken sandwiches. Normally afternoon tea is spot on perfect but felt this time not as good which was sad as it was my daughters birthday treat.</body>

        <body>Having had Afternoon Tea at the Ritz twice in the past and now experienced the Fortnum &amp; Mason Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon, I would recommend the latter every time.   The service was excellent, food delicious - perfect scones - and the ambience and atmosphere comfortable, calming and unhurried.  They even packed up the cakes that we were too full to eat at the time AND gave us another plate and packed them up too; plus a  full jar of each of the jams we had!  It&apos;s well worth arriving a little early so you can wander around the store beforehand.</body>

        <body>I visited the tea salon a couple of years ago, and I loved it. But this time the place seems to noisy and busy. We had barely finished our tea, and spend less than 2 hours in our seats when it was clear that the staff wanted us to leave soon. We were offered some extra cake to take home, but actually it would have been nice to just have the time to enjoy the cakes on our plates. And I find that the quality of the food has gone down since I last visited the place.  So actually a disappointing revisit. :-)</body>

        <body>I took my granddaughter for afternoon tea for her 10th birthday last week. The staff were great and arranged for her to have sandwiches of her choosing rather than their usual ones and they presented her with a slice of chocolate cake with a candle and sang Happy Birthday which was really lovely  for her and she enjoyed herself very much.  However I was disappointed in the choice of cakes and sandwiches (which were very boring) and not well displayed. The scones were lovely though and made up in a small way for the other dishes. The restaurant was lovely and as I have said the staff were great, well trained and very attentive.  I would certainly go back but not for the fixed price afternoon tea, I don&apos;t think it was really good value for money.</body>

        <body>The food was delicious, with the best scones any of our family had ever tasted. We are all vegetarians and were provided with our own menu which was really special. 2 of the party had birthdays and were brought complementary cake and happy birthday was played on the piano. The pianist was incredible and really added to the ambience. The waiters were also lovely; we were too full to eat any cake from the cake cart but they let us pick it and boxed it up for us so we had an extra treat for the next day. Overall a wonderful experience.</body>

The staff were extremely helpful.  The diamond Jubilee suite was very beautiful decorated and the atmosphere made even better with with beautiful piano in the back ground.

        <body>My party comprised 8 ladies - 7 had the classic afternoon tea and felt this was excellent value, particularly as you are given the option of additional sandwiches, scones and pastries, plus a selection from the cake trolley. The other member of our party is a vegan and therefore had this specific choice of afternoon tea but unfortunately it was very disappointing and very poor value. The vegan choice of sandwiches was excellent however the scones provided were dry and tasteless. Sadly they were also the only cake type option available, the alternative you provided was fresh fruit. Very nice but something she could really have had anywhere. This friend and I have recently set up a business baking sweet treats for those who have set dietary requirements, vegan, dairy free, egg free etc. and therefore we were looking at how you catered for a vegan with great interest.  We offer a far greater and better cake &amp; pastry selection which highlighted the lack of real effort and thought on your </body>

        <body>we had a booking at Fortnum &amp; Mason and were not pleased with the service that we got.   First of all they didn&apos;t even ask about our reservation Number or name when we arrived, wich felt odd as we made this reservation in good time before we came to London.  We came all the way from sweden and we were really looking forward to have our afternoon Tea. But it felt like some of your staff were a bit stressed and also wanted to get rid of us as quick as possible, wich made us very uncomfortable and disappointed.  It also felt a bit stressful because we didn&apos;t get the chance to finish our desserts before one of your staff asked if he could pack them in a take away box.. And also we only got 2 boxes when we were 3 persons and payed full prise for the Traditional Fortnum and Mason afternoon Tea and a bottle of still water.   If i should be honest it felt like wasted money, because we were expecting better service.. It&apos;s such a shame because we enjoyed the taste of everything but not the expe</body>

        <body>This is a lovely venue. There is a pianist playing as the lift opens to the floor where the have the have the afternoon tea.  The Venu is massive and split in to three rooms.  The tables are not crammed in so it feels lovely and spacious.  The decor is lovely.  It has a tiffanys favour as everything is tiffanys blue. The dinner service and the waiters ties.  The service is terrible. The worst after noon tea service we have had in London. Our tea ran empty with no offer to refill it, our scones ran empty with no offer to refill it, the scones are lovely, the jams are lovely too but the cakes are very disappointing. We had to call the waiters over to ask them to refill the tea. They never services is once without our calling them over. We began to feel like the forgotten table.  They have a cakes trolley of which we were not offered any until we asked for the bill. They then offered for is to take it away.  This afternoon tea is probably one of the cheaper ones but you get what you pay </body>

        <body>Unfortunatley after many visits over the years, this one was a dissapointment. The service was slow and the party felt at times after waiting long periods for any attention that we were actually being ignored. Maybe the staff were busy. The quality of the afternoon tea was ok but the scones were dry. We normally take our foreign visitors to fortnums when they visit us but after our somewhat dissapointing experience we will probably review this policy. We wish you all the best in the future and hope that you serve your last ever tea with the same enthusiasm as the first one you served.</body>

        <body>My third time here, but disappointed how we were hurried through the afternoon tea. Approached three times to see if they could package up our food and then after we paid the bill were asked to hurry up and leave the table as they had others waiting. If there is a time limit on the table, this needs to be annotated when booking</body>

        <body>This was my fourth visit to F &amp; M for afternoon tea. I appreciate the option of the savory tea trays as well as the luxe surroundings of the Diamond Jubilee Tea Room. The service, however, is inconsistent and too often slow. At this price point (£45 pp) I would expect constantly refreshed tea and trays, as well as freshly baked scones.</body>

        <body>We were in a part of the restaurant which was at the end of our waiter&apos;s serving area so they only occasionally reached us while other tables nearer to them had very attentive service. This meant that whenever we needed something we had to attract their attention regularly and our tea did not arrive until halfway through our meal.</body>

        <body>Would definitely come back again, (already planning my next visit) mainly for the pleasant comfortable atomosphere. As a coeliac was very pleased they offer a gluten-free menu (other dietary menus also available) &amp; that the afternoon tea on offer was delicious, particularly the finger sandwiches. Enjoyed browsing through the vast selection of tea &amp; was really happy with my choice of Black tea with apple, tasted wonderful. Also loved that we had the option to refil anything on the 3 tiers at any time during our stay. Had a lovely time!</body>

        <body>I went to the F&amp;M tea salon with one of my friends after a spa treat nearby. We had the high tea, which was a nice alternative to the traditional afternoon tea - I had the lobster omlette (nice but a little a bland) and my friend had the kedgeree scotch egg (lovely). The service was a bit up and down, but overall they were pretty attentive and didn&apos;t rush us at all, and the ambience was really comfortable, not as stuffy as other places I&apos;ve been. Would recommend</body>

        <body>Although the food was lovely,  the experience was dampened by it being cut short. I understand that there must be a time limit but when your food only arrives 45 minutes in,  it&apos;s not fair for us to only have 45 minutes to enjoy the eating experience. Our food was taken away and boxed up and we were sent on our way.  We didn&apos;t even get the cake from the trolley that we paid for in the original price.  It could have been a wonderful experience so it&apos;s a shame.</body>

        <body>It was a great night out for my friend and I to close out our 90 day stay in London. The salon itself was gorgeous and the live piano music put the icing on the cake. The food was amazing and the tea options were endless. I would say that the staff is what made the experience so enjoyable! They are all so helpful and friendly. We felt so welcome and left with such great memories.</body>

        <body>The food just kept - cooming, sandwiches, scones, cakes.  We could not eat all the cake (the last ones are on a trolly so you forget about them!) so our waiter kindly boxed each of us a cake up to take home.  Outstanding.</body>

        <body>We had afternoon tea here on Saturday at noon. This is a great time to go if you want a quiet and peaceful atmosphere. It starts filling up more by 1pm.  The food and tea was lovely, as was the glass of champagne. The only downside for us was that there was absolutely no consistency with the waiting staff. We were only there for about 90 minutes, but had at least 6 different people serving us. This is understandable if the place is packed to the brim with people, but for the first 45 minutes, there was only us plus one other table of people. On the whole, it was a lovely experience, and I would recommend going.  The piano music really added to the ambience.</body>

        <body>I spent an enchanting and memorable afternoon with my mother and aunt Monday the 25th of May, in the splendid surroundings of the Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon. Our reservation was treated efficiently and we were seated within a reasonable amount of time; just enough to admire the attractive waiting area with baby grand piano, sun clock and unmistakable Fortnum &amp; Mason canisters of tea. Our waiters, in particular George, were courteous, efficient and helpful at every turn during the selection of our menu and throughout the course of our meal. We were given extras of a favourite savoury dish we all appreciated, the lobster egg- simply divine! Food and service were of the highest quality. It certainly made for a most memorable and special dining experience!</body>

        <body>I wanted to take my friend for a &quot;typically English&quot; afternoon tea and we were not disappointed. The food was delicious, , the service was pitched correctly, attentive enough for us to feel that nothing was too much trouble, but allowing us to time to sit and enjoy ourselves.

        <body>Had great expectations to treat ourselves for a nice afternoon tea.  The place and environment is nice and food very tasty, but the service really let us down and didn&apos;t meet expectations - when paying £44 for afternoon tea, the higher end of the spectrum, you would expect top-notch service!  The wait staff (despite having so many of them walking around) were not attentive at all.  They didn&apos;t top up our water at any stage, and we had to ask where our tea was after we&apos;d finished our sandwiches - you would expect tea should be served when the food is bought out (or before)!  We also had to wave them down each time to prompt them a to refill our tea, refill our sandwiches or any other request we had. Also didn&apos;t explain what all the food items were and that we could get refills of anything when we wanted - we only found this out when we only had 1 of each of the sweet items to share between us.  We also didn&apos;t know who was looking after our table / area as all the wait staff were walkin</body>

        <body>This was our second visit and were disappointed by the lack of attention on arrival as we had to wait for five minutes before anyone came to the reception desk!  However our waiting staff were excellent.  The tea was delicious but further sandwiches and cakes were not offered until requested!  Our American friends thought the whole &apos;high tea&apos; amazing!</body>

        <body>Went on mums birthday. Sat next to window- very ugly view from outside so don&apos;t recommend. Seats and tables were luxuourious and comfortable. we chose the basic afternoon tea. I swapped tea for lemonade which was lemony but barely- diluted immediately from the ice. Tea was lovely. Sandwiches weren&apos;t really special but fills you after second plateful. Vegetarian options were ok, loved cheese and chutney but pesto and pepper didn&apos;t really excite me. Scones were soft and fresh- raspberry jam was lovely. little deserts were rose eclair, chocolate and orange macaroon (lovely), this puff pastry desert my mum loved and this white domed shaped desert which was tasteless. We asked refills for both scones and desert and took them home YOU CANNOT TAKE HOME SANDWICHES!! The cake selection is DELICIOUS so don&apos;t forget- if you are full up just order and take home. My mum adored the tart and the chocolate cake.  Georgia the waiter was attentive and kind. Refilling was not an issue. The wait for food</body>

        <body>Great service, child friendly, staff were great at putting us at ease with regards to two girls under age of 2 who were with us, for their grandma&apos;s birthday tea party.  Food and tea were in abundance and served beautifully. Vegetarian catered for,  cakes were not only eye candy but heaven to eat. Staff boxed my daughters cake she wanted to take home for her daddy who could not attend. My daughter loved her personal cake stand and my mum loved her birthday tea , definitely recommend to families for special occasions.</body>

        <body>My 21 year old daughter thoroughly enjoyed afternoon tea as a VERY special treat. Probably a one-off treat because of the cost, but an experience to remember. Excellent service and interesting atmosphere.  A large group nearby were enjoying a wonderful hen party. Good idea for this.</body>

        <body>I went to F&amp;M for afternoon tea on a Sunday after spending a girls weekend in London with my mum and sister.  We were greeted by a beautiful grand piano and stylish decor, had a fabulous dining experience and were served by lovely attentive staff.  I would 100% recommend afternoon tea at F&amp;M if you are looking to splash the cash on something a little special. I will be back!</body>

        <body>The staff were so attentive and what impressed me was that they had taken note of the additional information I had given - I have a nut allergy and they made sure I knew what I could and couldn&apos;t eat. Sandwiches and cake were replenished and when we had eater out weight in food, we were offered a slice of cake from a different trolley!!!!! We rolled out of the restaurant after an excellent afternoon tea - we were also given the option to take the bits we didn&apos;t eat home with us! Highly recommended!</body>

He was overwhelmed by the occasion and it was a  great afternoon.  We   all enjoyed  a wonderful tea in lovely surroundings.  Please give our thanks to all the staff in the restaurant as they were all very helpful and kind.</body>

        <body>Cutlery was heavily smeared and water stained on arrival. Replaced but with knives forgotten. Felt I couldn&apos;t ask again for replacement.When asked if we would like water, we assumed it would be a jug of tap water, however we were charged £4.25 for a bottle. This was not mentioned when offered by the waiter. Staff weren&apos;t wearing name badges, so we unfortunately cannot name our waiter who was very pleasant. Overall the food quality was second to none and the experience was special.</body>

        <body>Even that we had a reservation we had to wait for a table for almost 30 minutes and were placed at a table right at the entrance where all these people were waiting to be placed. It was loud and uncomfortable because everyone waiting could look at you. The service was ok but not what you would expect in a traditional place like this one. It felt more like being in a fast food chain than in one of the oldest tea rooms in London. The food and tea was fine but nothing exceptional. The sandwiches looked and tasted as if they had been prepared hours ago. There was no love for detail and there are surely better places in London for a traditional english afternoon tea.</body>

        <body>Only negative was that we were in the side room in the corner so the service wasn&apos;t up to normal quality as they were concentrating on the bigger tables int he centre of the room and we were stuck in the corner.  Ask to sit to in the main room to the left of the piano as you walk in, light and sociable in there and you can hear the pianist.  Overall still lovely experience and they didn&apos;t kick us out after our 90 minutes, in fact we were nearly 2 and a half hours.  Good value!</body>

        <body>We were very diapointed by our visit. We have been for afternoon tea at many of the top hotels in London and expected Fortnum and Mason to compare, but it did not. The service was poor. It was unclear who was meant to be looking after our table and it was extremely difficult to get anyones attention which made the experience quite stressful as we weren&apos;t sure if we&apos;d simply be forgotten about. After 35 minutes and chasing our afternoon tea finally arrived. We finished our sandwiches quickly as we were hungry. We managed to get someones attention to ask for some more. We couldn&apos;t believe that it then took a further 20 minutes for more to arrive! The sandwiches did not seem particularly fresh so we were confused as to why this took so long. The food did not meet up to the standards of other afternoon teas we have attended that were similar in price. We feel that the standards have been allowed to slip but that a premium price has continued to be charged simply due to the tourist demand.</body>

        <body>An amazing afternoon spent in the jubilee tea salon, the food was beautiful and plentiful and you could change your pot of tea choice halfway through if you wished. It&apos;s rather expensive at £40 to £44 so would recommend it for special occasions. If I had the smallest criticism, it would be that when they offer you water, they do not make it clear that you are billed for it, and £4.50 for a bottle of sparkling water is rather expensive! All in all a professional service, fab food, special ambience and the history makes for a really special time.</body>

        <body>We were given &apos;afternoon tea&apos; as a Christmas present from our eldest daughter.    We decided to use it on our wedding anniversary, 1st June.     Our experience was really special, our waiter (he came from Hull) was delightful and attended to all our needs and made excellent recommendations.   He even put a candle on the piece of cake he brought my husband.       I would certainly advise anyone looking for somewhere &apos;special&apos; to consider  F &amp; M.</body>

        <body>We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon tea. The sandwiches were so delicate and full of flavour and the cakes /pastries were ever so moreish!

        <body>Myself and my partner had a afternoon tea at F &amp; M on Valentines day. I have been to The Ritz for afternoon tea and/did compare the visits. The cost was the same so I feel the service should have been the same.  We had to wait a long time for our tea. We had already eaten one plate of sandwiches before getting our tea. An apology was made. We had to ask for more sandwiches and more tea. On my trip to The Ritz,  I didn&apos;t have to pour my tea at any time, the service was next to none. Waiters were always there to top me up and replenish sandwiches. Not once did I have to ask for anything but we asked for our first pot of tea 3 times before it eventually arrived, which I feel is poor service. The food was very good (apart from my last piece of cake) I had a slice of the Battenberg cake, which was rather dry and the marzipan had no flavour. The restaurant was set well, tables well apart - compare to close tables at The Ritz. Overall - service would need to improve greatly but food was as t</body>

        <body>Ambience and service good.  Bread was a bit stale.  Have been to better venues in London with far better selection of cakes etc. Other venues wheel a trolley of cakes around F&amp;M just had a table with 4/5 cakes to choose a slice from.  Overall the venue  was nice, spacious and bright although it looks a bit tired.  One final comment is that the table next to us left shortly after we arrived (20 mins) we were there for almost 2 hours and the table still hadn&apos;t been cleared when we left!.</body>

        <body>It was my sister&apos;s sixtieth birthday and we were celebrating with afternoon tea at the  Tea Salon. The room is beautiful and the live background music  adds to the atmosphere. We ordered the traditional afternoon tea. We had salmon, cucumber, chicken and ham sandwiches. Tasty and delecate. Then scones- plain and raisin. They were the best we have tasted! To follow there was a selection of fancy cakes. We took these home as we were so full. What was especially nice was the fact that we were offered fresh pots of tea by the attentive staff.  A lovely experience.</body>

        <body>I took my mum to celebrate her Birthday to Fortum &amp; Mason for an afternoon tea since it has been highly rated. Unfortunately something must have happened between then &amp; now since it felt like almost being on a Carry On movie scene. There were a lot staff, more than in a normal restaurant, and heaps of running around, however, getting served was a bit of a challenge. We got our tea ok but then it took quite a while to get our sandwiches &amp; cakes. The Waitress who offered to explain us what the sandwiches and cakes were,  was not actually able to do it in full since I have dietary requirement hence it was not &apos;the normal set&apos;. Trying to order more tea was almost like a mission - I had to ask twice. Also the staff were discussing their work contracts near by us which I felt was bit awkward. However, the portions were big and we were not able to eat all the cakes so these were put in a beautiful Fortum &amp; Mason boxes.  However, the Waitress/Waiter who did that was not on the ball regarding </body>

        <body>To celebrate our 47th Wedding we decided to spend the day in London and wanted to eat somewhere different and special. Our daughter suggested Afternon Tea, so I checked on line and found that Fortnum &amp; Mason offered a savoury option, this was a real bonus as my husband suffers from type 2 diabetes. We both enjoyed our Afternoon Tea very much, the food was delicious and the service excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed the occasion and would have no hesitation in repeating the experience.</body>

        <body>I took my Swedish mother-in-law for afternoon tea and cannot fault anything. The atmosphere was exactly how you would imagine it would be at a traditional Afternoon Tea restaurant. The food was delicious (and plenty of it)! and the service was charming. There were several large tables celebrating birthdays and it looked like they were thoroughly enjoying it also. I would highly recommend.</body>

        <body>Very calm, relaxed atmosphere, live pianist. Good selection of cakes, but service was a bit slow and as you only have  a two hour slots, we needed to keep asking for more tea or sandwiches.  It was explained to us that we could try up to four different teas. Would be have nicer if staff were a bit more attentive, but maybe they were short staffed.</body>

        <body>Had savoury afternoon tea which was very tasty and lots of refills avaialble.  We were a 6pm sitting though, so by the end I did feel that teh restraurnat were trying to get rid of us and almost forgot to offer us cake from the trolley.  The didning room itself is lovely though.</body>

        <body>Fortnum &amp; Mason is the premier tea spot in London, and it lived up to my highest expectations! The food was delicious, the ambiance impeccable, and the tea selection incredible.   The salon managed to be exquisite, while also approachable. Our waiter had a great sense of humor (we joked about getting kicked out of the restaurant if we put clotted cream and jam onto our scones in the wrong order), and overall it was a very pleasant way to spend 2 hours in London. Hat tip to F &amp; M for a delightful tea experience.</body>

        <body>Having read reviews on Fortnum&apos;s High Tea, we had high expectations. Unfortunately, these were not met. Although our initial waiter was very informative, he left after taking our order and we were then served by a range of different members of staff. Arriving on time, we had to wait for quite a while for our table to be ready, and even longer to be served. The hot starters for our high tea were rather pleasing, however, this is unfortunately where the enjoyment ended. The three tiered sweet stand arrived, after another rather long wait (where we had to ask twice for water and for more tea) and should I not have read online that there was a cake trolley, and it was possible to have the sweets replenished, we would not have been offered. The patisserie section was fine, but nothing outstanding, which was disappointing for Fortnums, and as they were not explained, we had to guess what we were served. Upon asking for an explanation, even the waitress was shocked we were not informed. As a</body>

        <body>We were attended to by Sebastian who made an already lovely experience into a memory my cousin and I can share for years to come. He was charming, attentive, knowledgeable, about tea and about the local art and history sites. He made us feel like family and we will return again and again for such amazing treatment.</body>

        <body>My visit was everything i expected it to be. The food is very decadent. The service is impeccable. The products to be are less expensive than you think so be sure to being home some jam or tea. And try to pay a visit to the confections area on the ground floor. I dont believe it to be kid-friendly. There was a child there during my visit but it was clear he was bored as he was doing some running around.</body>

        <body>Wonderful service - as you&apos;d expect - from a very knowledgeable and personable waiter. The food was delicious and very plentiful, as you could order top ups of sandwiches, the little patisserie cakes and of course, tea, as much as you wanted. We ordered an extra helping of the little cakes and then couldn&apos;t manage the cake from the trolley as we were so full. It was boxed up beautifully so we took it away with us for later. Although the table was available for an hour and a half, we were enjoying ourselves and talking so much that at least two hours passed and there was no sense of hurrying us on - we were made to feel very welcome throughout the stay. It was a special treat for my daughter as it had been her birthday earlier in the week and without a doubt, it was lovely thing for the two of us to share and over food that was beautifully prepared, served and presented. Nothing less than I&apos;d expect for what amounted to £100 for tea!</body>

        <body>We loved the ambiance of the room setting and the attentive service. We chose separate High Tea and Savoury selections to maximise choice. The cake selection was particularly delicious. A bit disappointed with the tea itself which lacked &quot;body&quot; and flavour compared to other venue experiences. Had seconds but, again, disappointed that they omitted to include in our  &quot;doggy box&quot; the second round of finger sandwiches we had deliberately left to enjoy on our trip home after  a subsequent tour of  Buckingham Palace. Never the less, generally impressed with the quality and service and how pleasant and efficient this facility is run. Recommended particularly for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>We ordered one savoury and one standard afternoon tea, this was a particularly good idea and the staff recommended it as they replenished the items we liked the most especially the eggs which were absolutely delicious.  We were able to bring home the dainty cakes that we could not manage to eat mostly because they had replenished our tea tower and we were possibly a little on the greedy side.  I would highly recommend F&amp;M for afternoon tea, the atmosphere was elegant without being too stuffy or in any way pretentious!</body>

        <body>Been here with my parents and they love the restaurant.  The restaurant is spacious and classy with lovely decoration.  There was also a pianist playing  piano which created a really great atmosphere.  Waiters are very helpful and polite.  We have had the tradition afternoon tea set and the high tea set which all scones, sandwiches and cakes can be unlimited refilled and already included in the price.   Overall, I would say the afternoon tea set is a bit pricy (45-55 pound/ person) but the food quality, atmosphere, service and ambience is of top quality.   Would recommend to couple, group of friends or family to go for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>Arrived 5 minutes before time to be told that my table for 3 afternoon tea had been cancelled (but then not so).  Made to sit and wait 10 minutes until after our booking time before my having to approach front desk again when we were then taken to our table for 3 (with 5 place settings). Food was excellent, as was the tea and table service.  Dress was smart casual, despite there being a gentleman at a nearby  table with his legs out, dressed in brown denim shorts and leather boots!  Getting attention for the bill was not easy, despite being acknowledged twice by the serving staff. Finally we all had to go to the bar to pay with our coats, only to be greeted with thank you and good bye. I decided not however to just walk out and said we had been trying to pay the bill at our table.  I left no tip.   I think it scuppered my wife&apos;s initial thoughts that it would be nice to do this on a monthly basis with individual members of the family.</body>

        <body>This was to be the first highlight of a three day trip to London one which we - two female friends-really looked forward to. It was such a disappointment. The service with the exception of front of house was inconsistent, not warm and lacking in any style.Female staff seemed disinterested and were not well turned out. This lack of interest/ energy was also apparent In the afternoon tea. Scones were dry not fresh, pastries dull. Our coffee was very strong. On the plus side the cocktails were very good as was the Victoria sponge from the cake carriage. We had no idea if this was included in the afternoon tea but ordered two cakes and received one. All I can say is that we have enjoyed afternoon tea in lovely hotels at half the price and twice the enjoyment. Fortnums seem to rely on their reputation but anyone who knows food should avoid this experience at all costs! Our bill came to £116 including service charge so be warned!</body>

        <title>Gaucho Piccadilly - London</title>
        <body>Tucked away in a little known side street off Piccadilly this Gaucho Restaurant provides a bit of the Pampas and Buenos Aires relocated to the heart of the West End. As you soon as you enter the restaurant the aroma of meat sizzling on the open grills hits you. As well as steak we do offer a selection of other dishes including fish, chicken, ceviche and vegetarian options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Gaucho we pride ourselves on the basic philosophy of provenance. To us this means authenticity, assurance and rigorous attention to obtain the finest quality ingredients at source. This dedication ensures that every time you visit us, you experience the true essence of Argentine cuisine. Its food, its wine, its culture and importantly the passion of its people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decked out in cowhide, mirrors and chandeliers we offer a full range of Argentine cuts of luxury beef, including the tender Bife de Lomo, aged for six to eight weeks and then flown in from Buenos Aires. </body>

        <body>My girlfriend surprised me with a meal and I have to admit it exceeded my expectations.  It was a fantastic day and the meal was a special part of the day. I would highly recommend the restaurant to everyone I know.  The food was amazing but the company was better lol. The staff could not do enough for you. They knew what they were talking about and we&apos;re so helpful .</body>

        <body>Haveto say I was looking forward to visiting the London restaurant. I had booked two weeks in advance as I know it gets busy. I went with my son and my friend and her daughter. We turned up just before our booking at 5.30. When I went to the front desk to give my details, the atmosphere was very unwelcoming, not great when you have two children aged 7 &amp; 11. Also they had no idea at the start about my booking, I had to go back ten minutes later and ask.. However before then they wanted to know if we could wait in the bar? Seriously we had two kids with us, at 5.30pm all we wanted to do was get to the table and order!!  Eventually, they realised we had a table booked at went up to level one. Another point to mention, why do the staff have to look like they work in the secret service on the front desk? Big over coats and ear pieces, this is a restaurant not an Embassy...  Eventually we sat down upstairs, the waiter was excellent and paid good attention( Wouldn&apos;t you expect that though fo</body>

        <body>This is definitely a night-time spot, very dark and mysterious as you enter with a black and white theme (black leather upholstery and black and white cow skins are the predominant theme). Prepare for hunks of deliciously grilled meat, but the trio of ceviches we started with were divine too!  The roasted sweet potatoes were sweet/salty deliciousness and even simple haricots vert were super crisp yummy.  Didn&apos;t have dessert, but had Argentinian ice cream next door.  You could feel like it&apos;s a little &quot;too cool&quot; with all the black clad wait staff and model-like hostesses, but they treat you very nicely -- no attitude from the staff, even though we were with our 12 year old.</body>

        <body>Poor service, some loud, drunk diners which management were to scared to confront. Nice food. Over charged on drinks (should&apos;ve been free after waiting 30mins). Wasn&apos;t told the meat menu was the other side of the placemat by front Man , had to be showed by another member of staff. Overpriced drinks. Lots of glasses dropped/commotion from kitchen. Had to tell one waitress our name 3/4 times , she kept forgetting and she needed it to bill our tab. Waiters and waitresses didn&apos;t hide their frustration with each other which I found totally unprofessional. Our food waitress had good knowledge but was obvious she didn&apos;t really care. Wrong steak came out first time so we had to hear her having cross words with the runner. Embarrassing. Having been recommended gauchos by my in laws (they visited tower bridge), we were so disappointed our experience seemed totally different to what theirs was. I wouldn&apos;t recommend gauchos.

        <body>Even if we have made an reservation for a dinner in Gaucho, we had to wait for our table more than 40 min without apologies or discount afterwards. There have been plenty of people having or waiting for dinner ad the service was quite chaotic. But as soon, as we got to our table it has changed . Waiter was very polite and helpful. Food and especially steaks were outstanding and I would definitely recommend this as great place to go, but I would suggest to go there in the less frequent time than 9 pm to avoid the chaos.</body>

        <body>The occasion was dinner with a platonic friend after a bit of late night shopping.  We dined at 9:30pm on a Friday.  The place was perfect: buzzy without being too loud to chat, fun but still sophisticated, the perfectly cooked steaks (Lomos medallions and Chateaubriand) were quality which was as hoped for but not always delivered in famous named restaurants/chains (disappointing experiences with Rhodes, Ramsay etc and likes of Carluccios) and service was excellent.  We also felt like we owned the place as we moved our table upstairs and twice took breaks out on the terrace, which was no trouble to staff.   I&apos;ve only marked service down slightly as I had to go seaching for someone to pay after we&apos;d finished our drinks on the terrace.   Overall excellent fun, good food and honest delivery.     Finally, our server Chris was very good: attentive not intrusive, flexible when we added to our order, nothing too much trouble when asked to move to the terrace to finish our drinks and shook my</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been a dozen or more times since it opened. This was the first time I felt we could make it better ourselves at home. The ceviche acid levels weren&apos;t right, avocado was rock hard, fries mostly crispy bits and cooked in old oil, chimichurri a little stingey. Steak and wine great as always.</body>

        <body>This was my third visit to Gaucho Piccadilly and was really looking forward to it and booked it weeks in advance. We were firstly seated next to a private dining section that was hosting what appeared to be a stag party the door of the private room was in constant swing with people going in and out and the noise level when the door opened was very disruptive, we were moved seats. We had to ask for bread 3 times and received it after the starters were eaten. Food was good. We were left with dessert menus for 45 minutes so had gone off the idea of something sweet by the time a waiter appeared and we were then  charged for an extra bottle of wine. Overall I was disappointed as we were there for the weekend and we were really looking forward to our night there.</body>

        <body>If it wasn&apos;t for the great steaks at this restaurant, I&apos;d suggest closing it down. The service is appauling. We waited 45 minutes for our first drink and had to chase the drinks twice. To add insult to injury, when the drinks arrived, one of our guests was given the wrong wine. The waitress simply chose to ignore this fact and put the drink on the table before walking off - we had to call her back and explain that we did not order it and she needed to remove it. If looks could kill, our table would have all been in trouble!  When we were given our bread plates a different waitress simply put a dozen plates infront of the nearest guest to her and told us to pass then round. Then came the food. Everyone was so excited about these fabulous cuts of meat until another waitress opted to shout out the order, no smile, no eye contact and simply treated it like it was a fast food order. The waitress was THAT rude that one of my fellow diners asked her to be mindful of her manners but by this s</body>

        <body>My partner is a steak lover and I wanted a place that really knew about steak and had the right ambience.  Gaucho was perfect for this. Before we even entered the restaurant I was happy. I requested a booth for 2 and that&apos;s what we got. We had a waiter assigned to us and was on refill duty and was making sure we had what we needed. But not in a badgering way. All the staff we encountered were very polite. My partner was very happy with the food, that he had to pause after evey bite. Most of all he was impressed by the restaurant and the staff. I think the pricing is very good, because the quality was there. I actually recommended it that night to one of girls.</body>

        <body>A few friends and I went to Gaucho Piccadilly for a nice dinner and catch up. I have been to one of the restaurants before and it did not disappoint. The food was quick and not too hot so we could start eating straight away and was delicious! The waiters were lovely and friendly and happy to answer any questions we had. The only downside would be the cloakroom staff; they seemed adamant to serve all the male customers before us (three girls) despite us having been stood there for five minutes before hand waving our tag at them. We would have expected more from such a high rating establishment.</body>

When we walked in to the restaurant I was very nervous about bringing the children as looked very pretentious, lots of moody lighting. However the staff were very friendly &amp; welcoming. The food was amazing the best steak we&apos;ve ever eaten &amp; portions huge even defeated our teenage sons !</body>

        <body>Was there for a quick business lunch and had just one hour for it. I did not even have to tell them so because they were very attentive with not a single thing delayed. Tried their chateaubriand for the first time. Devine.</body>

        <body>I have eaten at Gauchos once before and we decided to return for my birthday. From the moment you arrive the service you recurve is exceptional and the food is to die for. Our waitress was not only very helpful but also knowledgable in recommending a good wine to go with my meal. Great ambience, great food and great service make for a top dining experience where you get what you pay for.</body>

        <body>That was the loveliest steak I&apos;ve had in ages.  I took my brother there for a pre matinee lunch to celebrate his 50th.  Really glad everything was so well done, service was great and the food excellent.  Wish I could afford to go there more often.</body>

        <body>My main was a steak off the lunch time menu deal but I found that it was over-seasoned and too salty, which was a real shame as it was cooked perfectly and a nice cut of meat. Aside from that, I could not fault the food. The staff were polite to the customers but really horrible to each other, so it made for an unpleasant atmosphere.</body>

        <body>I had an old friend visiting from abroad and hadn&apos;t been to Gaucho for a long time preferring other newer venues such as Hawkesmoor, STK and Steakbull expert! I picked purely for the ambience for this occasion Gaucho at Piccadily! It didn&apos;t disappoint. The staff were attentive, friendly, personal, efficient and the food just as it should be.</body>

        <body>We have dined at Gauchos Picadilly on a number of occasions previously and our most recent experience was superb.  The service was very efficient, yet wholly personable; the food was absolutely excellent and the overall ambiance sophisticated yet relaxing.  This won&apos;t be our last visit.</body>

        <body>Having been to four other Guachos in London I was surprised to be disappointed with this visit. I found the service to be disorganised and unhelpful. When we were sat at our tables we were surrounded by staff rushing around and often had to ask twice for assistance. When visiting other locations we have been made to feel very special and welcome and left discussing what a fantastic restaurant it is. I will continue to recommend and visit Guacho just not the Piccadilly location.</body>

        <body>Good food but probably the worst service I&apos;ve ever experienced in any restaurant ever. When questioned on it the manager nonchalantly shrugged stating &quot;these things happen&quot;.  Go to the O2 restaurant is as good as this place is bad!</body>

        <body>Enjoyed the ambiance of the venue as well as the attentiveness of almost all the staff. The steak is amazing (on the small side but great). Only complaint would be that desert was very mediocre, I had to order a second one but it still wasn&apos;t up to purr. Sadly Virgin cocktails are limited to a choice of 2. Review based on lunch time setting.</body>

        <body>On arrival we were told that our table was not be available for another 10 minutes.. We were asked to wait in the bar area. We  were eventually shown to out table  at 8.50.  We were left sitting there for another long  spell. It  was between 9 and 915 before being offered a drink or our order being taken. service was extremely slow and poor. We did not bother with a starter  it was nearly 9.30 before our main course  arrived.No apology.</body>

        <body>Enjoyed our Saturday lunch here, and the set menu was appealing. Despite the restaurant was full, service was pleasant and efficient. Great steak, but it&apos;s expected I suppose!  I liked the mojitos recommended by the waitress, but my husband&apos;s gin martini wasn&apos;t so good. Nevertheless, we still rate highly the food and service, and will be back when it&apos;s warm enough to lunch on their outdoor terrace.</body>

        <body>table booked for 5.30pm.  We were there on time but staff insisted we went to the bar since our table was not ready.  After reminding staff in the bar area that our table was booked for 5.30 and it was nearly 6pm we were then escorted to our tables.  On entering the dinning area there were at least 4 tables that were empty.  Looks like everyone is sent to the bar area to spend more on drinks??</body>

        <body>The food is always great at Goucho&apos;s, we were just shocked by the number of supervisor staff and such bad customer service. We waited for over 30 minutes to get an initial drink, and were handed menus and didn&apos;t get the chance to order food for 45 minutes. It seemed from a customer point of view there were too many management/supervisors and not enough waiters.</body>

        <body>This was my first time at Gaucho and other than knowing they are well known for their meat I didn&apos;t know what to expect. The staff are friendly and make you feel very comfortable and welcome. The food was excellent. Their beef really is melt in the mouth and everything is cooked perfectly. The only criticism I would have is that the light in the restaurant is a little dim, I would have liked a bit more light but that&apos;s just a personal preference.</body>

        <body>Restaurant&apos;s atmosphere was lovely and the decor is very unique.. The service was top class, attentive but not irritating... Food was excellent, steak tasted wonderful, however would have been better if we were provided with steak knives, did struggle a bit...  Would definitely recommend to friends for special occasions, as quite expensive for casual outings..</body>

        <body>We visited as an anniversary dinner for my partner. Id visited before, so knew the quality and service to expect. Needless to say we were not let down.   The food was perfect from starter through to dessert. The churrasco de lomo was cooked to perfection, and quickly became our absolute favourite. We also had the beef tasting plate that was also amazing. We sincerely recommend both. Our glasses were always full, there was just the right amount of time between courses, and the music perfectly suited the occasion (at just the right volume).   Gaucho prices aren&apos;t cheap, but given the quality of ingredients, cooking and service, and the ambience of the evening, we felt it was entirely worth what we paid. It may have put my partner off standard quality UK beef for life though!   We will definitely return again.</body>

        <body>We went for a romantic meal for Valentine&apos;s Day, and that is precisely what we got! Everything was great! It is more expensive but the food is certainly worth the money! Alcoholic drinks are very pricey though and not in line with other restaurants in the area I would suggest! On the specials menu was the dessert that ended the evening in the fantastic way it started! I have visited other gaucho restaurants and this is the best one I have been to for service and food!</body>

        <body>The food was exquisite and the steak was cooked to perfection. However our own waiter seemed to be rushing around and wasn&apos;t attentive at all. We had a different man in a suit take our drinks and food order, he brought me the wrong drink and left the Chimmichuru marinade off my steak. For the cost of the food you expect these small details to not be missed. Saved by the food which was amazing.</body>

        <body>Enjoyed the night with my Wife. Steaks were excellent and cooked to perfection. Aperitif arrived late, but was given complementary. Limited starter choice.  Good value for money considering west end prices. Enjoyed the cocktail bar following our meal. Would recommend.</body>

        <body>I had been to this restaurant once before and thought it was fantastic so I booked a table for Valentines night. I was not disappointed. The place was rammed but we did not have to wait at all for service. The waiter was spot on. Quick and friendly. The place is perfect for a romantic meal or for anyone who just loves food! The food is without question and definitely one of the best meals I have ever had. 400g of steak perfectly cooked. No need for steak knives here as the meat is that tender. Yes it does cost a bit more but I am happy to pay the prices as I feel the food warrants it. Highly recommend it and definitely will be coming back!</body>

        <body>Fancy dining in a loud club with harassed staff? Want to find it difficult to hear your neighbour whilst having the distinct feeling you&apos;re being massively overcharged? Want a masterclass in how a resteraunt with great food can get almost everything else wrong? Seriously, it was like a cross between a bar for playboys and visit to TopShop. What was once classy is now gaudy and tasteless. I used to love Gaucho, but whoever is running now has only one thing on their mind: throughput and margin. The food was excellent, the taste left in the mouth however was sour. A very expensive lesson learnt. Like a McDonalds for oligarchs.</body>

        <body>We dined at Gaucho last week for my 50th birthday.  There were five of us - two ladies and three chaps.  We all shared a sausage platter which was very tasty and went down well.  One of the ladies asked if the waitress who served the platter could cut up the sausages into individual bites - which would have been a nice touch to have been done without asking (but just a small gripe as the task was done quickly, efficiently and with a smile).  One of our party chose the sea bass for a main which was apparently delicious and accompanied by a well chosen variety of vegetables.  Everyone else in our party plumped for a steak option and these we all cooked as individually requested.  The service was attentive and friendly at all times.  The only thing that was talked about quite often by our party was how dark it was inside the restaurant and toilets!  We dined outside for our meal so there would be an expected light differential through coming in from the outside - however, there was no ge</body>

        <body>The food and service were very good. Fabulous steak. The ambiance though was disappointing in that the lighting was so poor at our table we struggled to see what we were eating. Also sitting in a cellar with no natural light and black leather walls and cieling felt a bit odd, added to the fact that the chairs were very low compared to the table.  I didn&apos;t see a lift, and there were several flights of stairs down, so not good for those with mobility issues. I would try another of the Gaucho restaurants in London for steak but wouldn&apos;t rush back to this particular one.</body>

        <body>Lovely setting. The meat was amazing. The drinks were so slow that we started ordering the next round as each one arrived! Had to send chips back as &apos;tepid&apos; next lot were lovely and hot. All veg was like warm - not what I expected at a restaurant like this. To be fair one of our party has been before and said it was the worst service he&apos;d seen there and usually the service is excellent</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve been before and the food has been lovely each time. This time we did feel a little rushed with our meal. The bread and wine was only brought only right before the main course arrived and then as soon as we had finished we were being pushed for any desserts with no time to digest the main course. Unfortunately when we wanted to order coffee and dessert wine  we couldn&apos;t get anyone&apos;s attention so eventually just got the Bill and left.</body>

        <body>Took my brother here for a celebration dinner and we both loved it. We both had the fillets and they were delicious! We then followed it up with the nights dessert special - which again was superb. Naturally the prices are on the higher side, but given the whole experience its definitely worth it for special occasions!</body>

        <body>Three of our party of four turn 60 this year and we chose Gaucho for a &quot;Malbec pilgrimage&quot;. Service, food and wine were almost faultless (just some shrapnel in the thin chips). We indulged in three bottles of Malbec totalling £168 - wonderful. Less pleased with the poor/dim lights and the chairs that were rather low for the tables (and difficult to move). £3 for a pot of steak sauce or £4.95 for each side dish is hardly value for money but we agreed that we had had an awesome and memorable evening for £500 incl tip. After we had paid, our waiter commented that he had heard us mention a birthday, and asked whose it was.  So we explained the 3@60 thing and he returned with a complimentary bottle of Veuve Clicquot and four glasses.  Cheers Gaucho!</body>

        <body>They could make so much more on the ambience. The dining room is not cosy - it looks more like a disco and the  music was to loud! Nothing remembers to a steakhouse. The meat was good prepared, but the same night i spent most of my time in the bathroom - what went wrong? Did i get a steak that was shown around to the guests that evening?! Even two days after i have still serious stomach problems and i cant eat!</body>

        <body>Ordered  blue steak unfortunately, it was at best rare. Did tell the waiter and he offered to have another one cooked. I declined as my partner already had hers and by the time it was cooked and rested, she would have been finished. When you pay top notch you expect to get what you order! No adjustment made to compensate either, so you don&apos;t get five stars!</body>

        <body>Gaucho is a must-attend for those with a passion for steak. I&apos;ve had a variety of their different cuts here and they have always been excellent, with a very strong choice of wines as well. The staff are always extremely helpful and can talk you through the different cuts if you aren&apos;t sure what to order, or just if you want to try something new! The interior can sometimes feel a little too dimly lit and slightly chilly, but that aside I definitely recommend it!</body>

        <body>We were eager to revisit Gauchos as we were back in London to visit St James&apos; Palace and thought it the ideal place to celebrate a family occasion.  The food again was fabulous and our boys thoroughly enjoyed the experience of eating in a &quot;nightclub&quot; atmosphere.  We were welcomed nicely and received our starters and mains quickly and efficiently however service seemed to slip at this point as it did on our last visit too.  Such a shame because everything else was perfect!  Our waiter did eventually come over to apologise for his lack of attention but it did make what was going to be an exceptional night end on a bit of a disappointing note. However, the food is so good we will attempt a third visit to see if you can get a 10/10!</body>

        <body>A rare night off caring for our 10 month old, myself and my partener ventured into London for a meal at Gaucho Piccadilly, the ambience and decor were amazing, the cocktails first class and as ever, the staff were attentive and knowledgable and the food delicious. I recommend the ceviche sampler to start- beautiful fresh flavours and a nice light start when you&apos;ve got steak to come! Definitely recommend a visit.</body>

        <body>Lovely ambience and we felt welcomed by the staff who took our coats and brought us to our table. Had a delicious chateaubriand and some equally delicious sides, which unfortunately went cold as the waiter who gave us our steak ( which still needed to be cut) did not offer and walked away. With the regular dinner knives we had at our table we weren&apos;t able to cut the meat ourselves. ( we tried and made a mess out of it!) For such an expensive piece of steak ( and meal) we were disappointed that no one took the time to ensure we had everything we needed before beginning our dinner.  The servers appeared to be rushed and not interested in any attention to detail. Our actual waitress was polite and apologised and said someone should have been straight over to cut it for us. Overall a very nice evening, however the service was lacking in sincerity.</body>

        <body>Second visit to this Gaucho for lunch and it was as great at the first!  Excellent, food, service and drinks.  We&apos;re booked at the Manchester location in July.  Has to be the best steak in the UK!  Always cooked perfectly and very tender.  Great staff, can&apos;t do enough for you.</body>

        <body>This was my third visit to Gaucho and possibly my most enjoyable. The food was exquisite and the waitress attending us absolutely wonderful in every way. What can I say about the steak? 400g of prime ribeye which I hoped would never end. It&apos;s not cheap but sometimes you have to pay that little extra for pure class!!</body>

        <body>For all the Englishmen: Everything was fine and I enjoyed my visit at GAUCHO&apos;S.   Alles in Allem, kann ich das Gaucho&apos;s wirklich empfehlen; allerdings nicht für Menschen, die Steak nicht essen mögen, denn es ist ein absolut auf Fleisch ausgerichtetes Restaurant. Der Empfang war freundlich (der Cloakroom ist im Erdgeschoß zusammen mit den (sehr dunklen) Toiletten; upstairs ist dann dining angesagt) und unkompliziert.  Ich wurde sehr schnell an den Tisch geführt und dort auch relativ fix (5-7 min.) mit der Karte versorgt, was ganz in Ordnung war, da ich bereits auf dem Platz die saisonale Karte studieren konnte. Weiterhin wurde die Tagesempfehlung ausgesprochen und nachdem ich Getränke (der Wein ist passabel) bestellt hatte, wurde auf zügig wegen des Essens nachgefragt. Dazu wurde für das Hauptgericht eine Platte gereicht, auf der ich mir die geschnittenen Steaks anschauen konnte (von Rib-Eye bis Filet alles dabei und gut!). Ich entschied mich für eine Vorspeise (Auberginen) und das Fil</body>

        <body>Last time was much better cause i didnt like the sweet potatoe this time. It was much better with chorizo, to sweet this time. Didnt feel welcomed by the girl in the reception but out server James was very nice. Last time I was at Gaucho i got to sit outside and it was really nice and quiet. This i had to sit at floor two and couldnt hear what my girlfriend was saying.</body>

        <body>My wife and I attended Gaucho in Piccadilly for our 4th wedding anniversary meal, the service was fantastic, the food, as always, was the best steak we have ever eaten. Our waiter took the time to wish us congratulations and provided us with a complimentary glass of bubbles upon being seated at our table. The whole experience was a delight and we cannot recommend this restaurant enough, great for steak lovers, but also a fun atmosphere and excellent service throughout.... Thank you Gaucho Piccadilly.</body>

        <body>This was our first visit to gaucho grill upon recommendations from a relative. By far the best meal and dinning experience I have had in years! The venue is just gorgeous, the staff are all so friendly and classy! The food was out of this world, best steak I&apos;ve had! The waitress took time explaining all the different steaks and cuts to us which was nice. And the prices were very, very reasonable for what you get. It was my 30th birthday and the staff really went that extra mile to make it special.  The cocktails and wine they recommended to us were also delicious. Honestly can not wait to return to London simply to visit here again!</body>

        <body>Brilliant service and the food was excellent, my only gripe is the constant pop music. Putting that aside we had a wonderful meal and the staff were lovelly. If you can cope with the loud music (there are no quiet places) then this is the place for you. One slight other gripe that the staff could not sort out was the group of 2 couples on the table behind us were really roudy, I am not a prude but constantly shouting the F &amp; C words in a restaurant is inappropriate.</body>

        <body>We had talked about eating at Gaucho for quite some time and suddenly found ourselves available at short notice on Friday evening, and were pleasantly surprised that there was a table for two at 7pm. We were given a nice table and ordered the cocktail special. We ordered our food after the &apos;meat board&apos; display and decided on a trio of different steaks because it was too difficult to choose as everything sounded good, we also ordered wine. We had barely taken a sip from our cocktails before our food and wine arrived which was a bit disappointing and it felt a bit like we were on a conveyor belt. The steaks were well cooked and were very nice, except one of them was far too salty for both of us. The creamed spinach and the tomato salad sides that we&apos;d ordered were both very nice, but the sweet potato was disappointing as it was simply half a vegetable slapped on a plate. The beef dripping chips were disappointing too - they looked and tasted like cheap frozen chips. No sooner had we fin</body>

        <body>Probably a good place for Russian business men. But certainly not for a romantic dinner... Loud, gross, commercial music. Not enough light...  The food was OK, pricey for what it was. We ordered medium rare meat and got it well done... the staff was (reasonably) nice, and we finally got it how we like it.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve eaten at Gaucho before and it&apos;s amongst my first choices fora really excellent steak. Couple this with a superb Malbec and you&apos;ve got the basis of a first class dining experience. As ever, he staff were welcoming, friendly and attentive.   The whole evening was very pleasant and my guest was suitably impressed.   It&apos;s not cheap but you shouldn&apos;t be here if you&apos;re looking for cheap.  The food was first class, as was the service, and despite the fact that it was very busy it was never less than an excellent experience.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve made the mistake to book Gaucho&apos;s for 14 Feb and it&apos;ll be the last time we go there for Valentine&apos;s Day and the last time I go to the Piccadilly restaurant. I saw the nice looking sparkling photos on their website and as we&apos;ve been to two other Gaucho&apos;s before we were expecting a little bit more than than the small table in what looked like the basement of the building and next to our table was an open plan kitchen. We were not happy with the atmosphere and the only thing good was actually the food but for the amount of money we paid we expected a lot more otherwise we could have gone to MIller and Carter and had the same quality steaks for a lot less.</body>

        <body>Being a fan of steak this restaurant is the place to visit.  The meat is superb, beautifully cooked to your liking and full of flavour.  The ambiance is good and has a buzz about it, but it can be quite loud if only two of your are dining.  Would certainly recommend a visit.</body>

        <body>Visited here on a busy Saturday afternoon, reserved a table earlier on the day and on arrival was greeted very well and quickly shown to my table. Menu is extensive with lots of choice. Order was promptly taken, and I couldn&apos;t quite believe starters were with us within 5 mins of ordering (clearly pre prepared and kept in fridge, based on how cold they were). They arrived even before the wine we ordered. I realised that was the start of what became very hurried service. Quality of the food was very good, we had shellfish starters and Chateaubriand fillet for 2 for mains. Side dishes were an expensive extra but were very good. Tables are very small.Service felt very rushed throughout and plates and dishes were constantly being removed. Our table was totally cleared before we had finished our wine. Overall very good food, service could have been better and average value for £225.00 for 2 persons.</body>

        <body>We thoroghly enjoyed the meal, the staeks were excellant as well as the rest of he food. The service was good in part, but the man concern was demarcation of duties, so when the wine and water were late they had to find our waiter , rather than simply getting the drinks to our table. The room was interesting with good space between tables.</body>

        <body>We went here for my boyfriends 18th birthday meal for just the two of us and we absolutely loved it. I have been to another Gaucho before but Gaucho picadilly was our first time for both of us and we can both honestly say it is the best steak we have ever had and we didn&apos;t want the whole experience to end. It was very welcoming and everyone that worked there was very lovely and helpful. Thank you Gaucho Picadilly!</body>

        <body>We went for a Valentine&apos;s meal and had high hopes for the meal. I thought the atmostphere somewhat oppresive (v dark and somewhat pretentious). This should have been an Argentinian steak house...all saw dust and steaks but what we got was much like you get at the Crazy Bear restaurants. I understand it was Valentines night and therefore extremely busy but we felt like we were being hurried so they could get the next sitting it. So you couldn&apos;t fault them on speed of service! But I hate waiters topping up my wine glass. I am capable of doing it myself but it just smacked of them getting us out. Now the steaks... lovely but heavily salted and I mentioned that to the waitress but not sure she really cared for my thoughts. I had a 400g rib-eye and my girlfriend had the trio of medallions. Nice but too salty. I also took umbrage at the price of still water...£4.50 a bottle. Really!!  So overall 3/5. Hold back on the salt</body>

        <body>Good location. My husbands family are Argentenian and we found the beef empanadas very bland. The steak was good as were the sides. My main disappointment was the general atmosphere, although efficient  it was mechanical in nature,rather like a set for a sci fi movie. I thought the staff had been over coached .</body>

        <body>Steaks great, service better, but the place is so dark its painful! So many glass and dark surfaces that they also need to dust and clean more....its not dirty but its definitely not spotless.  I&apos;ve been several times but on this occasion I wouldn&apos;t recommend it, even though my guests enjoyed the experience.</body>

        <body>Food was lovely and helpful explanation from staff of the different cuts of meat. However service wasn&apos;t what I&apos;d expect from a restaurant of that quality. Took a long time to recieve drinks and have plates cleared. It was a busy Saturday but I would expect them to be well covered for staff at a peak time. Would recommend to eat here as food was great, but had a similar experience in the bar downstairs with regards to servic,  waited 20mins for 2 drinks!</body>

        <body>Steaks as advertised were very good. I suggest booking in person as the table we were given was not the standard of the meal or what should be the normal for this caliber of resturaunt    Insist on not having one of the very small tables along the wall essentially in the aisle.</body>

        <body> I was advised by my friend that a Gaucho the staff would bring out the raw meat to show the different cuts of beef   how ever The waiter did not even ask if its out first time at gaucho!! I had to ask him to show me your raw meat which i found  annoying!! The Grumpy waiter had no interest in his job. We waited 25 minutes for the waiter to take our plates      To top things off we were changed a extra £19.80 for drinks which we did not order I&apos;m still waiting for a refund!!   Great food shame about the waiter!! Emiliano  I will not be visiting this restaurant again</body>

        <body>Booked a table here for Saturday evening. Nice venue and the food that we had was very good. Disappointingly the service was very poor, with food removed before finishing, drinks taking too long i.e never appearing, which left us feeling extremely disappointed and rushed, fininshing just over 39 minutes. I always leave a tip, but not this time. To top it off, Olga the GM wanted to know what was wrong as I was going out the front door and the response was to give me a business card to phone to ensure I have a better time next time. Too little effort there and will not be returning</body>

        <body>The food was good and staff friendly as always but the service is very very poor. I have booked a table at Gaucho Piccadilly and as before the bar service was severely delayed with me chasing my order several times. It&apos;s very frustrating seeing other customer who ordered after me get their order first. At the table our main meals came to the table before we had finished our starters and the table being cleared. I found this very intrusive and spoilt our dining experience. At the end of the meal we requested coffee to be served in the outside seating area of the bar which was agreed. When we arrived in the downstairs bar we were told we could not have coffee in the outside area after 4pm. Although this issue was resolved it caused great embarrassment.</body>

        <body>Gaucho has the perfect service from staffs which is very hard to find nowadays in London. Worth paying for as well the food and atmosphere. Everyone need to experience at least once. I was there for Valentine and the staffs and the food made it more special! Will need to try the Sunday Roast now!!</body>

        <body>Our evening at gaucho was an enjoyable one,the restaurant is beautifully and tastefully decorated,received a warm welcome when we arrived. Once seated,(we had over a 3/4 hr wait even though we had booked) we were looked after by a very attentive waiter, who explained the cuts of steak to us and how they are best served. I can highly recommend the sirloin,it was melt in the mouth amazing! All in all it was a pleasant visit and would recommend anyone to try it!</body>

        <body>Steaks were best I&apos;d had in a long time and cooked perfectly. Service was spot on too, not too over the top.</body>

        <body>Firstly, too many staff. Staff on the door to greet you. Another member to escort you to the booking computers. Three computers  fully staffed. One of them assigns yet another member of staff to take you to your table. There you eventually get a waiter. I went there with my partner,we both ordered sirloin steak. Both steaks had too much gristle and were chewy; we sent them back. I tried sirloin again but it also had gristle and wasn&apos;t even rare, I asked for medium. My partner had sea bass but it was cold. The vegetables were hardly cooked. We paid for our wine and departed.  The waiter was helpful and manager apologetic. A bad experience, especially for my 65th birthday.</body>

        <body>Tries Sunday lunch for a change. Have visited on numerous occasions for the outstanding steaks that Gaucho offers and decided to try the Sunday lunch option. My wife and son plumped for the truly excellent roast beef with all the trimmings. They were both very happy with the choice. I chose the calf&apos;s liver. Again, I was not disappointed. A mouth-watering meal!! All in all, very good value and top quality food. I will be visiting again soon....</body>

        <body>Excellent meat, and a great wine list. not exactly great value for money, but not so bad for the West-End. It was a little faux in decor - I for one would have like to see more of contemporary Buenos Aires than a tourist advert gone wrong...  having said that, the service was excellent &amp; the atmosphere relaxed. And a bi plus is, though we were seated by the kitchen doors - hardly the best spot in the house - the steady flow of waiters was not too intrusive... Plus our server looked like Clark Kent aka Superman...  Would recommend to a friend. Good for biz meets....</body>

        <body>In the mood for excellent meat and good wine, then this is a good choice. Not cheap but overall, value for money. Only other comment -the first table I was offered was right under the air con unit. But we moved with no problem.</body>

        <body>My husband &amp; I really enjoyed our evening and the food, we were made to feel special from the moment we walked through the door, I particularly like the way our waitress showed &amp; explained all the different cuts and tastes of the steak.  The starters I ordered wasn&apos;t what I thought, unfortunately I didn&apos;t like it, but our waitress took it of the bill which I thought was good of them to do, as I see dining out a time to experience new foods and sometimes your not going to like everything you try so I thought that was nice of them to remove it from the bill. My husband &amp; I will definitely go again.</body>

        <body>Service wasn&apos;t what I expect at a Gaucho.   Whilst I was greeted on arrival and the receptionist rang upstairs to let her colleagues know that I was on my way up, there was no member of staff in sight. After a quick wander around the restaurant I spotted my lunch partner at our table.  The lunch menu was brief with only three choices and the food was OK without being exciting.</body>

        <body>I visited Gaucho Picadilly with my family earlier this week.   The food was very good as always, however I felt that the service was very poor and not the level I expect for a top London restaurant., this being compounded by us being given the table upstairs next to the kitchen door.  Specifically, my feedback would be: 1. Timing poor - long wait for bread (I had to ask for this and other tables who arrived after U.S. We&apos;re served before us) , mains then arrived immediately afterwards, then a  40 minute wait for desert (after we ordered!), even getting the check took 10 minutes from me asking when clearly I wanted to leave  2. Careless - dropped the oil served with the bread right next to the table disrupting  the ambience and our conversation  3. Inattentive - with much of the attention being given to a table of Americans next to us, resulting in increasing dissatisfaction as I tried to get the servers attention 4. Congested - we frequently had kitchen staff  bringing food out for se</body>

        <body>I booked an afternoon tea with champagne deal through Amazon Local for myself and 3 friends. The atmosphere at Kettner&apos;s was very pleasant on Sunday afternoon, there was a good pianist who helped create a nice ambiance. We initially waited a few minutes but were rewarded with a glass of good champagne. There was a good choice of teas and the sandwiches, scones and cakes were all very fresh and delicious. We ate every scrap! My only disappointment was that we were not offered hot water to top up our tea or some fresh tea. Otherwise the waiter was good, friendly and charming. The friends had not seen each other for ages and we spent a long time chatting after everyone else had gone. We did not feel under any pressure to leave and were generally left in peace until we were ready to go. With the deal which was £19.50 per head the value was exceptional but I would go back even at full price because it was very good.</body>

        <body>We ate at Kettners after partaking of their champagne bar following a visit to see The Audience in the West End.  Their champagne prices are high, the cheapest bottle about £65 so they could increase their range slightly, but the place had a real buzz about it and we were greeted and taken through to our table after we&apos;d finished the champers.  My friend said the Pork Belly was one of the best he&apos;d tasted and I opted for two starters instead of a starter and a main.  My husband had the burger which was quite pink but okay for him and my other friend had the fish which was delicious.  Overall, a good place for something to eat and drink after, or before, the theatre in Soho.</body>

        <body>This was a booking for myself and wife&apos;s birthday so a good meal and &quot;couples&quot; environment. Going by reviews this looked like a good place to go - her birthday is 11 days before Xmas but it was probably 3/4 full of Xmas parties! Loud environment, pretty warm and not the ideal setting!  Food and service was good and I&apos;m sure it&apos;s different outside of December!</body>

        <body>Clearly geared up for pre-theatre dining.  Good, prompt service by friendly staff who new the menu well and were able to help and advise.  We were entertaining French visitors who enjoyed the very English atmosphere. Part way through our meal a pianist began to play the white, grand piano, which was nice. I wish he had started earlier and had been playing upon our arrival.  That would have made for a lovely welcome.  Our theatre was right next door.  It could not have ben more handy.</body>

        <body>although our food was mostly ok [apart from the tap water which was foul smelling and had to be replaced by bottled ] the atmosphere was very unsettled with many tables complaining about a variety of things especially where thy were seated in relation to big tables and were unable to converse at normal levelsOne party of ladies were very unhappy at being split up and in fact refused to accept the tables offered so the restaurant had to be re- arranged to fulfil their booking . We ordered a pear and pecan tart for pudding and it was the most pathetic  dessert we&apos;ve ever seen obviously microwaved and made by an inept cook. My wife had to point out to the management the filthy state of the toilets which obviously had not been checked. There seemed to be a surplus of &apos;suits/managers&apos; moving around in the restaurant who apparently achieved nothing unlike the waiters who did a good job in very difficult circumstances. We have used this restaurant of about 30 years but will not do so again.</body>

        <body>We had a drink at the champagne bar, which has real old world charm. A great little find to catch up with a friend. Then we moved on to the restaurant for dinner. I like the buzz and life piano music. The food and service is always good. We would def. go back soon when we&apos;re in Soho</body>

        <body>Thank you to the wonderful staff at Kettner&apos;s for preparing a wonderful afternoon tea for my sister&apos;s 50th birthday. They made her, my daughter and I feel very welcomed and prepared a little extra treat for my sister. Well worth the travel from Newcastle and Portsmouth to meet in the beautiful settings of Kettner&apos;s. Would love to visit again soon</body>

        <body>This was my second time in a month to visit Kettner&apos;s. I like the restaurant, especially with the 50% deal. The fish (sea bream) was really good, and the Warm tart at the beginning as well. I ordered the same spiced apple tart I had a week earlier. On this occasion the portion had shrunk by nearly half - hence my reluctance to add more stars to the service (The pie was really small on this occasion 7 cm long and and 2.5 cm wide).</body>

        <body>It was a lovely meal and the service was good, when we managed to get some. Really slow and more concerned with laying tables then taking plates away, getting the bill and letting us pay for the bill. Such a shame as it was great other than that. Perhaps it was the wrong time of day or something.</body>

        <body>Really great restaurant.  I visited on a saturday night with my husband, it was really lively and all the tables were full which is a good sign of a good restaurant.  Staff were friendly, helpful with recommendations and really quick given how busy it was.  Loved the food.  I had the filet steak which was cooked to perfection!  My husband had lamb which was also wonderful.</body>

        <body>Slightly hesitant after chancing upon the Guardian review from 7 years ago, but looks like this is all in the past, and I couldn&apos;t really fault it. Had a great Mother&apos;s Day lunch, and although they were dealing with a full service our waitress was attentive without being obtrusive, and we didn&apos;t feel rushed. Slight mix up with desserts was dealt with apologetically, and the item was removed from the bill without us having to ask (which truth be told we probably wouldn&apos;t have done).  Food, although not especially adventurous, was of a high standard - mostly brasserie classics like beef bourginoun and confit of duck, and on some occasions that&apos;s just what you want. The portions were modest, but after two courses we were satisfied and after three or with sides we might have been full.   With the 50% off deal our meal for 3 people (w/o wine) came to just over £40, which I consider a bargain. I feel there may be better options if paying full price (purely a hypothetical from my perspective</body>

        <body>We went as a party of 4, post-theatre.  The venue and location is lovely, the food was delicious and the service was very good.  The main problem was that there are too many tables crammed into the restaurant area (presumably to maximise profit), which meant that there were far too many peopled packed in to make for an overall enjoyable experience: we had to shuffle and slide around a corner seat in order to get to the &quot;inside&quot; padded chairs as there was inadequate space between tables to get through - 2 of our party were over 70 and it was difficult for them (and we are all of slim build - goodness knows how a bigger person would manage!).  The alternative &quot;outer&quot; chairs were uncushioned andwooden which ended up being very uncomfortable as we had to wait an hour for our main course - again I&apos;m sure there would not have been such a delay if there were less people to be served.  The waiters did an admirable job serving the food and wine,  considering that they had to lean over anybody </body>

        <body>Had better experience at kettners I will not be returning for their valentines set menu.  The service was ok but waiter did not no what it how the food was prepared and we got sent the wrong dessert. They was nice enough to move our table even though I requested a seat by the window in my booking, got told it was fully booked but by 7 the restaurant was empty. Will return for dinner but not a set menu plus the price for two was extortion esp for what we got.</body>

        <body>I used to go to Kettner&apos;s every few months when I moved to London 25 years ago and it really was a brillliant place to meet pre-theatre. I hadn&apos;t been in years so thought it would be great to return for lunch before a matinee.  The staff are lovely but the waiting staff seemed a little clueless about the menu. I asked if the pumpkin tortellini with sweet potato and sage butter was stuffed with sweet potato or pumpkin. The waiter said sweet potato. Er, no, it wasn&apos;t! Sweet potato came in small diced chunks on a bed of spinach, SWIMMING IN BUTTER, way too much. Very off-putting.  My friend enjoyed her goats cheese starter very much.  My friend&apos;s burger came with chips but these were covered in rock salt and she sent them back and asked for some with no salt. Our rocket and parmesan salad was also covered in rock salt. Good job there was plenty of tap water available! I really feel that salt should be optional, especially as there was salt and pepper on the table.  Dessert - don&apos;t usuall</body>

        <body>Overall the experience was very enjoyable. This venue however was very tired looking and needed a full refurbish. The food and service were very good although we did bulk at the automatice service charge of 12.5% on both the food and the cocktails we enjoyed before our meal. It was a bit expensive for a pre theatre supper.</body>

        <body>Kettner&apos;s had been recommended to me by a friend several years ago, but I&apos;d never got round to going. We finally did on Easter Monday prior to a visit to the opera. We allowed ourselves a  bit more time so were not restricted to the pre theatre menu (which seemed very reasonable). A la carte options were varied, plenty of veggie options, 1st &amp; m ain courses very tasty and good quality. The whole experience was very enjoyable, really liked the décor of the restaurant too</body>

        <body>I visited with 4 friends on a Sunday lunch time prior to the theatre. We were told on arrival that we could not have the pre-theatre menu which was disappointing but we had the Sunday roast instead which was amazing! Great value for money and the desserts were fab. Lovely atmosphere - service was quick and attentive. Would highly recommend for drinks or lunch or dinner.  Cocktails are superb!</body>

        <body>Had a very pleasant pre theatre meal with a friend. She had never been before and was impressed by the building and there was a busy atmosphere from 6.00. We didn&apos;t go for the pre theatre menu but we still had 2 courses in what felt a very relaxed meal. We arrived at 5.30. We had a bottle of champagne as that what it&apos;s famous for and so the bill wasn&apos;t cheap but the food is great and it&apos;s reasonably priced.</body>

        <body>When you are charging these prices the service should be good with a warm welcome, it wasn&apos;t so take it as a sign to go elsewhere when the first 2 members of staff you deal with are abrupt. I will say the starters were good but the mains got returned and the waiter was poor with no sincerity in his actions or voice, needs to change his job.</body>

        <body>The decor is just beautiful, making for a relaxed evening.  Varied menu although could do with another veggie option.  My friend had vegetarian Wellington, I had pasta which although very tasty was not particularly hot.  Finished with chocolate dessert and sticky toffee pudding which was fabulous.  Varied drinks menu with lots of choice.  The champagne &quot;Winter Warmer&quot; on offer was a nice touch especially as we were celebrating a very belated Christmas.  We went on a school night and it was such a shame that we only had our table for two and a half hours as it cut short the evening but we went for a drink in the lovely bar after.</body>

        <body>The menu looked impressive. However the portions were tiny and the food was very bland. We had 50% off the food but if not we would have complained. Very overpriced for the quality.</body>

        <body>I have visited Kettners on several occasions, went on Saturday night for a 6.30pm table after a show.  It was very noisy and busy with many pre-theatre tables but emptied out about 7pm.  Great food and nice service.  It never disappoints.  The bar is lovely for a glass of fizz or cocktail before a meal, or just to experience for a drink.  Would recommend.</body>

        <body>Booked for my birthday celebration but we did not inform Kettners when we booked. However the waiter was very attentive and surprised me with a special Happy Birthday dessert without prompting from anyone!  Thank you!  Service was excellent, food delicious and ambience delightful!.  Third visit and will definitely go again.</body>

        <body>&quot;Liked the relaxed feel of this place although a little noisy. The Sea Bass was very good albeit a rather small portion.  Everyone loved the Evening. Service was friendly.  Very good but quite pricey for the standard, having said that would definitely visit again&quot;.</body>

        <body>We went to kettners for a birthday celebration. The staff were very efficient and the food was lovely. The only thing I was disappointed with was id ordered a birthday cake and what I ordered and what came out were two very different cakes. It was only a small thing but disappointing all the same.</body>

        <body>I would recomend Kettner&apos;s to a friend, but the system will not except my &apos;&apos;tick&apos;&apos;! Ambience, nice and traditional, no table cloth but proper linen nepkins. Not many diners at 7 to 9pm and the large rooms look rather empty. Good food, but meat was almost raw, when asked for medium rear and had to be sent back but come back just right with appologies. Prices a bit expensive, but we had a special offer which was well priced! I would come again but at the reduced price!</body>

        <body>We went on a Tuesday and ut was not busy but they seat all the diners on one area, and it did get a bit noisy at times! The place itself was lovely, service was great. We had 50% off food with top table which meant 3courses and wine and service was £40 each. Nice for an occasional visit would be expensive without the deal. The food was good but have had better.</body>

        <body>Kettners has been through several lives that I know of and we booked 1/ as most of the table wanted a burger and pizza type night, and we thought it still was in that incarnation  2/ We thought we were  getting a 50% off  deal via Opentable. Turns out we got neither. There are burgers, and the ubiquitous Lobster &apos;n Mac. Our table of 6 were happy enough with their meals- nothing special. I had arancini, weirdly presented as croquettes , with neither of the usual fillings, but I love risotto in all forms - it was OK. We started in the bar ( and mentioned to the maitre de that it smelt of dirty mop- not pleasant), then to dinner- quite a loud room, volume pushed up by live piano -nice for quiet afternoons, not needed for crowds at dinner.  Service was fine, but we didn&apos;t get the deal we thought had been offered when we booked- maybe we read Open Table wrongly.   So - handy for Soho, but there are a lot of other places we&apos;d go to first.</body>

        <body>They are very accommodating , the decor needs a good lift. The handmade rugs on the floor need to be washed. The haddock was very blend, the Dorset crab as starter was good and the puddings wee outstanding . Bravo to the chef who was in charge of the pudding as it was better than many 2 Michelin star restaurant we have eaten before.</body>

        <body>Went with my girlfriend, sister and her husband as they were visiting. Staff and decor are very nice. Good food options. I was happy with mine but two at our table got the fish and it was overcooked, when mentioned to the waiter they asked what we would like to do rather than making a suggestion. We left it there and moved on.</body>

        <body>My only complaint is that is that when ordering the steak we were offered two very different sized portions for the same price and they were clearly cooked together.  We ordered them to be cooked medium-rare/rare but these were medium-well-done/well-done.     The service was excellent and though the restaurant was busy we were well looked after.  Thoroughly recommend but don&apos;t go for steak- I regretted that decision</body>

Great menu choice, without been outfaced with a big menu, nice cocktail to start recommended by waiter no Bellini on cocktail menu! Really good food. Three course dinner,cocktail and wine , price ok for London. Very good experience , attentive staff. Would recommend and would visit again.</body>

        <body>We have been to Kettners several times over the years on our visits to London and have always been positively impressed by the standards of food, service and ambiance.  However, this was not the case on our most recent meal there on March 7th in the evening.  We had invited friends and we had been confident in the standard we expected. We are vegetarians so we realise we are going to have a restricted choice.  In the past, we had really enjoyed going a la carte and had had the vegetable wellington on at least three occasions.  This was no longer on the menu so we chose from the list of daily specials.  When this came, it was simply two deep-fried rice cakes accompanied by a spoonful of courgettes - this was on the menu as being grilled vegetables.  It was a travesty of a meal.  Our friends also chose from the daily list but remarked that it was probably the case that the smarter the restaurant, the &quot;mingier&quot; the portions!  Possibly we had not been at a weekend in the past but the nois</body>

        <body>Went along as part of a group of 6 for a long overdue catch up.  We were all in high spirits and the ambience of Kettners suited our mood, it&apos;s got a buzzy vibe perfect for sunday afternoons. Our waiter was very attentive without being at all obtrusive, food and drinks came and went without our even noticing! The food was delicious, and about the only thing that managed to keep us quiet for minutes at a time! Kettners is not for every day, it&apos;s a little bit special and the prices reflect that but we were lucky enough to get 50% off our food bill which helped. I would definitely return for more occasions and perhaps even try an afternoon tea or one of their event nights.</body>

        <body>The savoury selection (sandwiches, quiche) of the afternoon tea was very good. Some of the sweets were good (e.g rhubarb tart, scones). Clotted cream was not quite as good though.   Quirky settings in the restaurant. but quite appealing. Staff service is good.   Tables are a tad to close to one another. So was a bit intrusive when the group beside us were quite loud.</body>

        <body>I had not been to Kettners for years as I now live in Australia, but I had fond memories and a friend recommended it for a leisurely lunch to catch up with friends.  Initially I was a bit disappointed as the surroundings looked in need of a spruce and because it was a Tuesday it was very quiet and the shabby &apos;not-so-chic&apos; appearence  was probably more noticeable. However the friendly service and good food made up for all that. Great menu - superb crab and fish on offer and the meateaters loved the venison.   I would definitely go back. It was perfect for us.</body>

        <body>We had the 50% off food menu and made the most of it. The duck salad was brilliantly bitter with liver and chicory, the venison was cooked exactly as ordered and the sticky toffee pudding was light, crumbly and superbly tasty ie nothing like I&apos;d ever had before with this name but far better. A tad more salt in the ide cream perhaps would have raised the overall dish to perfection but it was excellent as it was. Will definitely be going back</body>

        <body>I booked the laurent perrier afternoon tea for my fiances 30th birthday for four of us.  Service on arrival was very polite, we were offered use of the cloakroom and we were shown to our table. The tables seemed a bit cramped as it was quite tight to get between the tables to be seated on the benches  The server knew we had booked the champagne flight tea so these were brought to us and she explained each of the champagnes and how best to enjoy them  When the food arrived it looked amazing, and every single item was delicious, we cleared the lot!   Im not sure if tea was unlimited as this wasnt mentioned to us, but this wasnt too much of an issue as we were more concerned with drinking the champagne :)</body>

        <body>The menu seemed to be made up on the hoof! Considering we were the first diners eating there that evening, the soup we ordered was changed immediately after we had ordered. The grilled fillet of sole was very overpowered by the side accompaniments. We didn&apos;t inform the maitre&apos;de at the end of our meal.</body>

        <body>I booked Kettner&apos;s some time ago as a post show dinner.  We have been raving about it to friends and family for years.  We took our daughter and son and their other halves as a birthday treat for my husband.  We were sorely disappointed(and a little embarrassed as we had recommended it so highly) with the food and the service and at this stage won&apos;t be going back!  I will be writing direct to Kettner&apos;s.</body>

        <body>We had a good meal but the tables are very close together and it is very noisy. The food was good but we allowed 2hrs to eat and we had to rush our dessert and miss coffee as it was a bit slow between courses. It was Saturday evening, so it might be better on other nights.</body>

        <body>I have not been to Kettle&apos;s for a long time. The service and food were a good standard. The ladies loos are in need of a refurbished.  In fact the whole  place looks a bit tired. All in all a good choice for pre theatre.</body>

        <body>A Friday lunchtime, empty champagne bar and restaurant. Very disappointing ambiance not much fun eating in an empty establishment. Food rather lacklustre, portions small. Staff keep asking if everything ok, gets rather tedious although they mean well. Really not great value for money compared with other similar establishments in the area who offer lunchtime deals.   Signed up for a deal with 50 % off food but then found out too late that  this in only on a Monday, so watch out for this when looking at  offers when booking online.</body>

        <body>I used to go regularly to Kettners in the late 90s then was disappointed to see its refurb a few years ago as I was attached to the slightly tatty red furnishings! But yesterday&apos;s visit was a really pleasing one. Professional and pleasant staff, great moules to start, excellent steak (not cheap and not part of the TT offer) and lamb, crunchy veg. Will definitely be back.</body>

        <body>The main dining area was practically empty at 6pm so there was no buzz but I don&apos;t really mind that, as it allowed the decor to be viewed fully and the period music to be heard clearly. Thoroughly enjoyed the setting, definite wow factor. The carpets and decor and the toilets could all do with a refresh. Dining on the 50% offer was a relief as the price for what you got was phenomenal and not in my opinion good value. You are most certainly paying for the privilege of being in that building. Next visit will just be for a drink and to show off the decor to visiting friends who love Art Deco.</body>

        <body>We took advantage of the 50% deal. Kettners was light and airy and we were greeted warmly. The food was delicious with generous portions although one guests fish portion was a little small. Our waiter Javier was very attentive. Although I did not tell them in advance it was a birthday treat, Javier presented us with a complimentary ice cream with a candle in a strawberry and happy birthday iced in chocolate, a delightful touch. I will definitely  be going back</body>

        <body>We had our daughters wedding at Kettners two years ago which was excellent. Our pre theatre experience was not as good and the food was average and expensive. The slow roast pork was very tough and fatty and when we mentioned it the waiter did not charge us but by that time we would have been late for the theatre so accepted it.</body>

        <body>You can tell the good/popular restaurants - they are generally busy on a Monday too  but Kettners, even with 50% discount was fairly empty. I certainly would never go back at full price - and although the discount helps a little it really doesn&apos;t equate to the very average food. On the upside - the service was good, out waitress was attentive and had a sense of humour.</body>

        <body>We went on a Friday night at 8pm, and despite very good service and food, the restaurant was very noisy which meant that we struggled to hear each other (there were only 4 of us). In addition, we had a table in the middle of the room and limited space between tables for people to go past, and kept hitting my chair. By 9pm the restaurant was much quieter (especially thanks to the table next to us having left!)  Overall a good experience but I would go back at a quieter time</body>

        <body>Very good food and service. The fish (halibut and sea bream) were very good. The starters: smoked salmon and Dorset Crab are recommended. The dessert of the day, apple tart with spices was excellent. And the choice of Green and White tea is fantastic. With the discount all this is even better. Really enjoyed my evening with my friend.

        <body>I cannot recommend Kettners enough. The reason for my visit was to treat a family member to a meal before going to one of the nearby theatres and she was wow-ed by the place, decor and atmosphere. This was her first visit to Kettners, but my 5th or 6th and I am always blown away by the food and service. The service is right up there with the best and staff were very knowledgeable about both the pre-theatre menu and the main menu (which we ordered from).</body>

        <body>Thank you to all the staff who looked after us.  Lovely food and staff attentive. Good selection of gin.  Lovely environment. We went for pre theatre meal as part of our wedding anniversary celebration stay in London.   The only negative point is they take your credit card when opening a tab at the bar when you are dining their.  Wasn&apos;t made clear to us as we would of paid upfront for pre dining drinks.</body>

        <body>Overall very disappointing, I wouldn&apos;t recommend at all. Our pre-dinner cocktail order was forgotten...  My scallop starter arrived cold...  My rare steak arrived burnt and dry... when I tried to get the waiter&apos;s attention to return, he was no where to be seen...  I asked for bernaise sauce and was presented with a pot of mayonnaise I had to ask 3 times for our wine order The cheese platter was gorgeous... presumably because the chef had minimal input The décor was tired, particularly the windows where you can see the paint peeling. Overall not worth £165.... a waste of money and a Saturday evening.</body>

        <body>Kettners is a favourite with my husband and I after we have been to the theatre or to meet up with friends. This time I took my childhood friend who is visiting from the U.S. where she now lives. She thoroughly enjoyed the experience of Happy Hour cocktails followed by dinner. She also found as a vegetarian she had a good choice from the menu. I will return.</body>

        <body>Had such a good evening, the food was incredible - I had the venison which is something I&apos;ve never had before, and it was delicious! I loved the pianist playing in the background, it was perfect to have in that setting and a real treat to have while eating dinner. The service was great, our waiter was very friendly and attentive. We went to the bar after dinner and the drinks were very tasty too! I loved the surroundings, it was elegant and stylish, but comfortable at the same time. Overall a very enjoyable evening, I will definitely be going back very soon.</body>

        <body>We ate in the restaurant that was situated on the second floor. It&apos;s a lot more intimate that the downstairs brasserie with less tables but more space and a pianist. The food was fantastic - the ingredients or offers weren&apos;t especially different but extremely well executed and tasted perfect.</body>

        <body>The change in Kettners mirrors the change in London over the past 20 years. Nobody really gives a damn about anybody else. Not that they ever really did, but it&apos;s at a new level now. And managers/owners seem to have all but ignored the fact that staff need to be trained.  The food was very good and the private rooms upstairs look perfect for a small party.  It&apos;s nice to see the building hasn&apos;t changed much but just a pity that, like rest of London, it has somehow lost its soul.</body>

        <body>There was such a lovely environment and we were served so quickly. When the wrong order was served, they were quick to apologize and bring out our dish. The food was alright, with portions not evenly sized, but for the whole experience and with the 50% off, it was enjoyable!</body>

        <body>We sat downstairs in the restaurant on a Monday evening - it&apos;s rather quiet in the area, and the restaurant wasn&apos;t busy but it has a very charming atmosphere. It was nice how they had spread us out throughout the room so that we weren&apos;t sitting next to other tables.   Food was beautiful - everything from the Crab on Toast (highly recommended) and the venison perfectly done with a delightful cocoa sauce. I&apos;d definitely go back again.</body>

        <body>Arriving at Kettners with an hour for a pre theatre menu one would have thought this would have been comfortable, but the delay to the meal arriving meant we were stressed and rushed. The food looked and tasted good but honestly I barely had time to chew, with it being 7:05 by the time the main course arrived, luckily the theatre was close by and we were paying by cash. Expensive gobble and go. Would not recommend for a pretheatre. Disappointing.</body>

        <body>I&apos;d booked with Kettner&apos;s  as a belated Mothers Day gift as I saw they had an afternoon tea with a paired Laurent Perrier champagne flight.  I&apos;d never seen this before so was excited to try it out. I added this to my booking notes and thought I&apos;d pointed this out to the waiter also...   The waiter came over with a glass of champagne, one of which was spilt all over my mum. She was completely soaked! We weren&apos;t even offered to move to another table nor was the table even cleaned properly, I had to do this myself with my napkin.   The food was served and once the savory part was finished I was expecting the second glass of the flight. I checked with the manager as he bought out a glass of champagne for my mum as an apology and he confirmed we were served the standard afternoon tea.  Thoroughly disappointed.... Wouldn&apos;t recommend and won&apos;t be returning.</body>

        <body>I used to visit Kettner&apos;s regularly in the 1960&apos;s and 70&apos;s for private and business lunches and dinners. After not having been for many years I rediscovered it and this is my fourth visit in the last few months as it never disappoints. The dining area is so light and airy and the decor tasteful. The food is always immaculate and well presented. A delightful haven in the West End ideally convenient for theatre going.</body>

        <body>I am a frequent visitor at Kettners as it caters for so many occasions - afternoon tea, Sunday roast, work night dinners. It&apos;s affordable and centrally located. It has a great ambiance with the 1920&apos;s style decor. Great for private dining too or business team events.</body>

        <body>We started with drinks in the bar and thought the cockail list was very limited. However, Dario who can make cocktails off list proved to be a gem and produced the best pornstar and melba martinis we have had in London beating the Mayfair by a mile. The nibbles of nuts and parmesan bites were very moreish too.   My lobster mac n cheese was delicious and overall the food was fine but our lasting impression were the cocktails!!!  And we will defo be back for those.</body>

        <body>Kettners has a lovely atmosphere and the Afternoon Tea was excellent.  They continue to serve dainty sandwiches and scones and cakes, which is rare.  The selection of teas is also very good.  I would recommend it to anyone.  (Oh, and the flight of champagne was also very welcome and tasty.)</body>

        <body>We ordered the valentine&apos;s menu and all the courses were a really low quality.  The first courses were absolutely  few and tasteless.  The quality of the meet which we asked for the main courses were good but terribly cooked.  Both of them came with spinach which were absolutely tasteless and I had to return mine because the sauce that came with my beef was and tasted burned and the meat was too much raw (I was not asked about the cooking).  When I receive again my main course, the meat was well cooked inside but burned and dry by outside. The coulant we ordered for dessert was not bad but the white chocolate ice cream that came with it was absolutely tasteless as well. We absolutely regret to choose this restaurant for dinner, particularly on Valentine&apos;s day.  Regardless on the price (which was not low at all) is unacceptable to serve food like that.</body>

        <body>Kettners has long been one of my favourite restaurants to go to in London.  Sadly this visit saw an old fave fall spectacularly from its perch.  Whilst the service and ambiance remained at its former standard the food and menu options had taken a turn for the worst.    From a table of Kettners fans the overall consensus was not a good one.  Average/Overpriced/Pre-Prepared and generally disappointing.  Sort it out Kettners, I want to like you again.</body>

        <body>I really loved the bar.  We got a seat easily on a busy Thursday night.  Lovely cocktails before dinner.  Service good.    Dinner was nice.  Friend had seabass and I had pork belly.  Overall  decent and good size.  Pork belly was a bit too fatty and not enough meat so slightly disappointing but flavour was good.   Wine list is pretty reasonable.  Food price is high without any discount or deal.  Would go again for drinks but would only eat here when there is a special offer.</body>

        <body>We went to Kettner&apos;s for an anniversary meal and were not disappointed. Wonderful ambience, fantastic service and incredibly tasty food. We had confit duck, which was more than an ample portion - we ordered a couple of side dishes but could have managed without them. For dessert one of us had the sticky toffee pudding and the other creme brûlée, both equally delicious and good sized portions.   The two-hour time slot was more than enough and the meal didn&apos;t feel rushed. The family on the next table needed to finish their meal much quicker to get to the theatre, so the kitchen were very obliging and produced their mains swiftly.   We&apos;lol definitely go back and next time we&apos;ll try the bar and champagne cocktails too!</body>

        <body>I met 3 friends at Kettner&apos;s for a sunday evening catchup and cocktails in their bar, with the friendly service, were a good start. However it was disappointing that they&apos;d run out of the vegetarian wellington i had really fancied from the menu. The saffron arancini i bad instead were delicious and the saffron flavour was just right; but the chantenay carrots I had on the side were pretty crude and lacked *something* to lift them beyond simply being carrots in a bowl. Likewise my pear &amp; pecan tart was teeny and tedious, compared to my friend&apos;s exciting-looking chocolate &amp; caramel &apos;teardrop&apos;. In all I would come back as I&apos;ve eaten bere before, but on the basis of this meal alone I&apos;d have been....underwhelmed.</body>

        <body>Firstly the waiter was very patronising when I asked what the difference between the two menus we had been given. One menu titled &quot;Pre-theatre menu&quot; and underneath &quot;Valentines Day menu&quot; with the prices of the 2 course or 3 course option. There were 3 options per course on this menu. The second menu had &quot;Valentines Day Menu&quot; as the title as well but with no prices and approximately 4-5 options per course. When I asked the waiter what the difference was he then laughed and retorted &quot;Well, the dishes, obviously&quot;.  When I pressed further he elaborated and said that the one with more options was more expensive after beating around the bush a bit. When I looked online they had a lovely varied menu that had a 50% offer on toptable which was not provided at all on the day. The food was good other than the dessert which was titled a Toffee and fig sticky toffee pudding. When I received it I was a little disappointed to find toffee popcorn scattered on the plate with the pudding that did not ta</body>

        <body>My wife and I have been going to Kettner&apos;s since our first date 27 years ago, and we will probably continue to do so because of our very positive feelings about it. But this visit was disappointing. We had to wait an unacceptable length of time for ours in course because, we were told, the fish three of us had was over cooked. There was an apology, but if we had been going to the theatre our evening would have been ruined. Our waiter was incredibly pleasant and efficient and it was clear that what happened was not his fault. There was no attempt to recompense us in any way. In my experience, when something like this happen, the restaurant takes something off the bill. The food was only fair. One dessert - pear and pecan tart - was a big disappointment. And we would not have said we had value for money. I write this with regret as we do love this place.</body>

        <body>We were showed to the bar as our table wasn&apos;t ready.  We waited 30 minutes to get a drink.  Once at our table, we were surprised by a set V-day menu priced at £45 (was not mentioned on Opentable).  The starter of warm duck salad was average followed by some very greasy also warm (I think it should of been hot) lamb.  The Raspberry cheesecake was a winner though.  Probably wouldn&apos;t go back which is a shame as I like the décor.</body>

        <body>Thoroughly enjoyable pre-matinee lunch. Was very quiet pre-1pm, but atmosphere picked up nicely from then. We had the duck salad and mussels for starter - very good. For main the sea-bass (marvellous) and fishcakes (very large helping of tasty food here) with mash and spinach on the side. Sorbet for dessert was disappointing - not quite cold enough and almost creamy. All in all very happy.</body>

        <body>Food was excellent and we didn&apos;t have to wait long for it. Service was good and they happily accommodated our request to switch tables.  Was good value with the 30% off deal but not sure if I would pay full price.  Only criticism is that some of the tables are too close together.</body>

        <body>We had drinks and dinner on a Tuesday evening and took advantage of a deal offering 50% off the final food bill.  This place has a great atmosphere, decor and buzz about it even on a Tuesday night. The food was a little disappointing even with the 50% discount offer and I certainly wouldn’t pay full price as it’s just not up to scratch. The excellent service, amazing building and ambience do make up for the less than fantastic food. They have an assortment of fabulous private dining rooms upstairs and a lovely cocktail bar on the ground floor making it a great place for a party, meeting or event. They had a beautiful jazz singer in the downstairs bar which was a nice touch. I will defintley be back for drinks and may take advantage of the 50% offer again but it will be the building itself, atmosphere and service that I’ll be coming back for not the food.</body>

        <body>I took my two daughters and their boyfriends here for a birthday meal on Monday evening and was very impressed. We&apos;re fussy buggers so are harsh critics. The service was faultless. The waiters were dressed in black and white in a traditional French way. They were attentive without being overly involved, very polite and helpful. The food was beautifully presented and very tasty. The portions are not big but didn&apos;t leave you hungry and the side orders are enough for four. Each one of us fully enjoyed our chosen dishes. The styling of the large dining room is modern traditional with a Scandinavian touch. Sympathetic lighting and knowing that you are in a place that is stepped in history creates the perfect ambience. With 50% off the food I would definitely go back and also recommend it to my friends.</body>

        <body>Had a family lunch on Sunday. Staff were very friendly and courteous. One overheard us toasting my sister&apos;s birthday and her dessert arrived with piped chocolate message - a lovely touch.  Beautiful room.  Piano playing next door where folk were having afternoon tea.  Food was good, but portions were a bit mean.  Went on a 50% off food offer which meant it was good value.</body>

        <body>We were excited to be eating at the mango tree but we&apos;re really let down by the staff who were too attentive boardering on intrusive. We didn&apos;t enjoy the various people constantly interrupting our meal... And the main Thai green curry lacked in flavour and was dish water thin :-((( leaving us very disappointed!</body>

        <body>The food is really good and service outstanding. It&apos;s a bit over priced but we had a voucher for 50% off the food bill. The only thing was the choice of music (house) and the fact that the atmosphere was pretty stiff - it didn&apos;t look like a place where you could have a very socialised dinner with a big group.</body>

        <body>Ignore the bad press. I nearly cancelled my booking after looking at the negative comments. Glad I didn&apos;t. Staff were lovely &amp; attentive, menu was easy to understand once explained what was in &amp; out of 50% deal. Nice wine at reasonable London prices if you turned a page or two on the wine list. Beef starter was lovely &amp; &quot;safe&quot; soup a winner. Two currys for main with rice &amp; veg. Didn&apos;t feel rushed at all Great evening &amp; will be back</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Mango Tree a few times. Usually I feel that without an Open Table offer it&apos;s not really worth the price, but with an offer it&apos;s a lovely place to spend an evening.  The place can get a bit noisy and the tables as close together. Luckily this time, our lovely waiter helped us find another table, further away from our very loud neighbours.</body>

        <body>We went to  mango tree as the reviews were very good. Being a vegetarian it was very disappointing. I had a aubergine dish witch had  a sauce poured over it, but the aubergines were not soft and cooked and were chewy.  The flavour of the sauce was not in the food, so I think it was poured in at the end instead of being cooked in it.  The food was also very expensive for what it was.  I would not go again. However I did observe excellent customer service and they were doing a lot to help people with issues.   I would say please develop your vegetarian dishes and re consider how much you charge for vegetables.</body>

        <body>This place has so much potential - you can see how by the layout of the restaurant, the friendly staff, etc but the food falls flat.  The 2 main courses we tried (chicken with cashews and beef with oyster sauce) were very bland and tasteless.  To be honest I could have cooked this meal much better myself, which is a real shame and NOT the point of going out for dinner.</body>

        <body>We decided to opt for Mango Tree for a special occasion and was a little reluctant as it has mixed reviews on here. For a wednesday night it was still fairly busy but the service was really attentive yet not overpowering at all. The cocktails are really good yet fairly expensive at £10+ each. We used the Opentable offer which gives you a great selection still and saved £30 overall with the 25% and 50% off dishes so would recommend using it! Would definitely go again :)</body>

        <body>The food at this premium Thai restaurant was below par. The seafood appetiser plate looked tasted and had a texture that indicated it was warmed from frozen rather than prepared fresh - soggy tempura for example.  The main course Pad Thai was bland and tasteless and the the beef stir-fry was unbearably over-seasoned. There are a hundred pubs that serve fresh authentic Thai food for half the price.  The room is large and on the evening we dined filled with large rowdy tables of birthday celebrations. It&apos;s an odd location catering mainly to tourists one would imagine and best avoided.   The mostly Thai waiting staff were professional if matter of fact although the restaurant manager made a good effort to recover a poor meal but ultimately the unacceptable food means it would be pointless to accept her invitation to return.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve yet to be disappointed with the food here, presentation and flavour is and was amazing as usual!  On this one occasion it was my friend&apos;s birthday and I had mentioned this in my reservation and upon my arrival. I was a little disappointed that when they brought a cake out and sang happy birthday, it was nothing like the other customers&apos; experience with a group of staff coming along and singing. We had 2 waiters that sang out of sync and couldn&apos;t pronounce my friend&apos;s name...it was terrible and somewhat embarrassing!  Again, my experience from only this visit, the staff were attentive, but at one point it becam a little too much. As it was just my friend and me, it felt like we were constantly being interrupted and asked if our meal was ok.  Other than that, food and ambience were great!</body>

        <body>This was our second lunch visit in the last few years with, unfortunately, the same results as the first.  Both times it was bland food; overpriced, even with an offer;  and a fairly chilly dining room.  I don&apos;t think there will be a third chance.</body>

        <body>It is not too bad. But the only down fall was that not all food is 50%. It is selection and some are 25%. Which is a bit unfair and misleading. And the rice is over price and small. £3.95 for rice.</body>

        <body>As always, Mango Tree was delicious. I booked on the 50% off menu - it was a little disappointing to find out that it was only available on a very restricted number of starters (six) and main courses (three) so the temptation to order something else from the very extensive menu was pretty high! The side dishes, drinks and (delicious) puddings rack the price up in any case so don&apos;t expect it to be a cheap meal out - but it is amazing. Mostly, the service is attentive and helpful (we got one trainee who wasn&apos;t up to speed yet but everyone else was great) Recommend highly regardless and I will return once again.</body>

        <body>This restaurant is beautifully fitted out with lovely Thai waitresses. The food was very good and I would certainly recommend the restaurant.  There are certainly a couple of things that Mango Tree could improve on.  Firstly the special deal offered includes only some of the dishes on the menu. It is rather confusing as some have no discount, some have 25% and some have the 50%. The other thing is that there was so much pressure to order drinks that in the end we just laughed. We were even asked if we wanted more beers when our glasses were still full up!</body>

        <body>I booked the 50% off deal on OpenTable and was a bit wary as previous reviews had said that there were issues with getting their discount, however as soon as we sat down the staff explained the menu and how the deal would work and what was included. The dining room itself was gorgeous, the staff were super attentive and were able to adjust dishes to our taste and the food was delicious. I can&apos;t fault The Mango Tree and I will definitely be visiting again!</body>

        <body>This was one of our favorite Thai restaurants but the flavour and size of portions have been poor ans very small recently. Our favorite fishcakes were too eggie, and at £9.50 I expected a perfect chocolate souffle not  a crumbled  cake mass! I think we will think twice before return.</body>

        <body>Being a frequent customers of Mango Tree my wife and I were extremely disappointed with our experience on Valentine&apos;s Day. The restaurant seemed overcrowded and our food came out cold. After sending it back we were then served another round of cold food. This is not the quality that we expect for a dining experience that cost us £90/head in the end.  We have never had this problem before at mango tree and feel that there was obviously an issue with serving the amount of valentines dinners you had booked.  Kind regards  Robin and Shauna</body>

        <body>Delicious food, lovely atmosphere and great service as always :-)  Had the chicken Thai Red Curry which was beautifully done with a lovely coconut sauce which had just the right level of spices. The Sticky Rice went really well with this dish too.   Only downside is that it is very expensive, especially as I did not have an alcoholic drink.   We were only meant to have the table for 2 hours but stayed for much longer catching up with friends and they did not hurry us out as the restaurant was not quite at full capacity which was nice. All in all a wonderful experience!</body>

        <body>Upon arrival we were guided to our table which was far away from the other diners and were left for a while before a waiter came for our orders. It wasn&apos;t as if the restaurant was full and everyone was rushed off their feet. I don&apos;t mind splashing out on good food and for the mains we had the Pad Thai, Steam fish and Mixed seafood selection. The food was ok but I have had tastier Thai dishes elsewhere. I felt that the restaurant is overrated and overpriced. Will definitely nor go back again.</body>

        <body>Early evening meal for two, starter and main, plus a couple of drinks each, overall was reasonably priced, good quality food, service was attentive.  Food came out very quickly, perhaps a little too quickly for my preference, but it didn&apos;t really detract from the experience.</body>

        <body>My girlfriend and I booked Mango Tree to celebrate both of our birthdays last Friday.  The bar area was great and the service throughout the evening was fantastic!  The restaurant had great ambiance and atmosphere when we were taken through to our table.  There was a nice menu selection and we took advantage of the 25% off food offer.  Whilst we had a great evening and were extremely well taken care of I cannot help but feel that the food was over-priced.  It was good food but not outstanding by any means.  All in all it was a good evening and we were well looked after and even had a little birthday singsong at the end so I would recommend to others to try it but wouldn&apos;t necessarily rush back myself.</body>

        <body>I went with a group of friends as a leaving dinner and the atmosphere was quite jubilant.  Our drinks waiter was extremely knowledgeable n helpful n our food waitress was extremely helpful as well. She even taught us Thai.  Yes the bill was quite high but you are in SW1 n a few feet away from her majesty. But the food, drink, service n atmosphere was excellent.  Go here if you want to impress or having an event n don&apos;t minf spending £200 even with a voucher.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Mango Tree before, but this time was simply disappointing. I couldn&apos;t even make myself eat half the food we ordered. The Spring Rolls had too much paste and were practically empty, and the aubergine in the curry was so chewy and dry it was inedible. The waiter was nice and took some things off the bill, when I still won&apos;t be going back any time soon. What was the kitchen up to?</body>

        <body>Overall lovely food and great service.  The only disappointment  what I would highlight is be prepared to pay for the gratitude,  which is not optional you have to pay it.   On this occasion I was happy with the service and would have paid a tip,  however if this was not the case I disagree for paying for a service that I did not receive.</body>

        <body>I&apos;ve been to Mango Tree several times and always been impressed by the food and service. On Friday we took a cousin to the restaurant, raving about the food.  However, although the service was faultless as ever, the food was a little disappointing. The flavours weren&apos;t as &quot;wow&quot; as they had been on previous visits and some of the menu was overpriced - £6 for a side dish of rice, almost £10 for 2 bottles of sparkling water.....my red curry was tasty but not very authentic in flavour. I would think twice about going there again as I don&apos;t feel it&apos;s delivering the promised quality of food.</body>

        <body>The atmosphere and service made this a good night out. I was a little underwhelmed by the food- I ordered the lamb shank and it lacked in flavour, but my fellow diners seemed to fare better with their orders so perhaps it was just a bad choice. Overall though I enjoyed my night there!</body>

        <body>I booked this restaurant partly because there was a 50% off food offer on Opentable, however this was disastrous. We sat down and were greeted by a waitress with poor English who spent several minutes explaining which items on the menu were 50% off, which were 25% off and which had no discount at all. It made us feel like we were only there for the discount, which made me taking a client out for dinner look cheap in what was a very over priced restaurant for the quality. The service which followed was dreadful, slow staff avoid your requests and leave you sitting for ages with no food or drink, but as soon as they do serve you food, they then pester you to ask if they can remove plates when it is clear we were still eating. The food was good, but not special and certainly not as impressive as the prices. The only good thing was the location which is very central and parking was convenient.</body>

        <body>Quality of the local Chinese or Thai take away at fine dinning prices. Food was cold and wasn&apos;t very nice.   On the other hand great service and staff.</body>

        <body>I booked dinner for two which entitled us to an early dinner discount on food (it&apos;s a little pricey otherwise though not unreasonably if you&apos;re after a good quality evening meal). The restriction meant we had the table strictly for two hours max, but with immediate, non-intrusive and attentive service, and each course being delivered as and when needed, this was ample time to enjoy two courses and a post-meal hot drink. The restaurant itself is elegantly kitted out and feels like an ideal date venue, though there were also lots of groups that suggested it is also a good place for business meetings. Probably not the place for a casual lunch, it might feel a little intimidating, but perfect for a special occasion or a nice evening out. We were served by two trainees who were delightful, incredibly polite and asked if all was alright with the food in a genuine way. The food was lovely - I had seafood skewers to start and the fish was grilled just so, with a generous side of beautifully t</body>

        <body>50% off food deal is well worth it. The wine was excellent and the non-alcoholic cocktails looked fanastic. Attentive service and a nice atmosphere. Slightly disappointed with the food although that was likely to just my poor choice - average spring rolls and a rather bland chicken rice dish that needed something else to pep it up. Other choices looked much better!</body>

        <body>Went there with my boyfriend on 50% offer, I must say the food was delicious and very nice ambience. We both are food lovers and this is one of the best Thai places we have been so far. We will definitely go again! However if it wasn&apos;t for the offer, food can be very expensive. I am glad we found the offer and tried this place!</body>

        <body>We arrived earlier than expected, but there was no problem securing our table. The starters of mixed satay and spicy prawns were excellent value: much larger than we had envisaged. The mains, too were on the large side, so we needed to take away the left-overs for lunch at a later date.</body>

        <body>First time at Mango Tree, after having vaguely hearing about it on a TV show and typing into Google, &apos;Best Thai Restuarant in London&apos; and Mango Tree coming top.   Well I must say, it lived up to it. I took my stunning Valentines date there for the first Valentines in 15+ years and I felt good (hadn&apos;t lost my touch).   Reservation booking was online and a streamlined process. 50% deposit was required to secure booking as it was a valentines special but the price was incredibly low for a set menu especially made for valentines. I was dubious as I like choice but once I&apos;d seen the menu and its themed description I was happy to give it ago. On arrival, found parking really easily but recommended parking spaces on the website might be a good idea as it may be tricky to find parking if you&apos;re dining  before 7pm.  Was welcomed on entry and offered to take a picture and any clothing for the cloakroom. Shown to our table promptly (although we were 45 mins late) and was still offered a good amo</body>

        <body>Have been going to the Mango Tree every now and then for years, and enjoyed it again this time. The food is good and it has a nice atmosphere. In my opinion the wine list is too pricey - a glass of NZ Sauvignon cost over £11.  The staff are generally efficient but service was let down by the fact that we had to practically beg for tap water - they kept &apos;forgetting&apos; to bring it (but I suspect mineral water would have come immediately). They also refused to leave a jug or bottle on the table, so we kept having to ask for refills, which was a bit annoying.</body>

        <body>Mango Tree is in a bit of an odd location which makes it stand out all the more. It&apos;s a beautiful restaurant staffed by lovely Thais and the menu is extensive but not overwhelming. We had the mixed stay and spring rolls; both dishes were large and beautifully presented. For mains we had a beef dish and a Pad Thai; again both were very good. The only thing that I would question is the value; had we not had the 50% off food offer I feel it would have been quite expensive for lunch.</body>

        <body>staff were very friendly and polite.  food was also worth the bill and portions were big and it was filling.  it was my husbands birthday and the staff at mango tree did make it special.  service charge is high but worth it because the staff were lovely, welcoming and polite. I would go back for a different occasion.</body>

        <body>Mango Tree is a busy, popular restaurant with slick, speedy service. The portions are generous &amp; the food is well presented. The menu was devoid of surprises &amp; was none the worse for that so if something Thai in the Victoria area is required the Mango Tree should fit the bill.</body>

        <body>Really enjoyed the Gewurtztraminer. Expensive at £55 but wow, what a flavour that works so well with Thai food. This wine was as good when we visited 2years ago so well done for keeping a great wine list to previous high standards. Good range of food, suitable for veggies or carnivores or flexitarians. Would not recommend meals near Xmas as too busy with work parties, but lovely for two on a Sunday evening in June.</body>

The atmosphere was really good and the look of the restaurant gives it a unique and inviting vibe. The service was outstanding  friendly and helpful staff. Overall 4/5 I would highly recommend this restaurant.</body>

        <body>It&apos;s no wonder they do not display prices on their website. Far too expensive, very poor value for money. Only told they wanted the table back at 9 when they called on the day to confirm. The feeling of being ripped-off leaves a bad taste.</body>

        <body>As a regular customer I&apos;ve mostly been very pleased by food and service. Sadly this time there was a long delay after ordering the second course. Not typical I&apos;m sure.</body>

        <body>Booked this restaurant for our our 15th wedding anniversary dinner and were very pleased with our choice.  The service was excellent and so was the food. Although there wasn&apos;t much choice for veggies, what we had was lovely. A nice touch at the end was the chocolate desert they brought to us on the house as I had mentioned on the booking that we booked for a special occasion.</body>

        <body>This is about the eighth time we&apos;ve been to Mango Tree, we usually try and get a deal there, which they do quite often through the Bookatable app.. Having had 50% off A la Carte last time I thought the choice was a little bit limited (understandably so) on the pre theatre deal. Whilst it&apos;s very good value, if I was to go again i wouldn&apos;t book that deal! Had Pad Thai Gai. Thought it was much smaller than a la carte version and there was no egg net!! Missed that.  All in all a good value meal, service was spot on.  Thanks</body>

        <body>We visit Mango Tree regularly and last night took my boyfriend&apos;s  mother for her birthday - she is vegetarian and was pleased with the choice on offer. We had a nice bottle of New Zealand Sauv blanc and an Argentinian Malbec - both delicious, if a little over-priced, but you expect that for the area. We shall return!</body>

        <body>We enjoyed a pre-Theatre meal.    The service at this restaurant is outstanding.   Efficient and fast. My starter of Prawn Spring Roll was good standard fare while my wife&apos;s salad was too hot &amp; spicy for her taste.   She said so but the waitress was disinterested.  We both had the duck main course and this was tasty and well prepared.  Good value tasty food and happy to recommend for pre-theatre dining.</body>

        <body>I booked a table on Valentine&apos;s day for lunch for 4 people at the Mango tree because I saw a special offer on Open table which was 50% off on a la carte menu. Which I thought was a good deal. However once we arrived we ordered some pre lunch drinks and later when we about to order I mentioned the manager about the offer she said that though she could see my booking through open table but she won&apos;t be able to give me 50% off. Since we were half way through our lunch it was too late for to go to another restaurant. It would have been too embarrassing to take my other guests half way through our lunch to another restaurant. So we landed up eating there. I landed up paying a full price. What a disaster it was. I&apos;m definitely won&apos;t recommend this restaurant anyone. There&apos;s no customer service the staff were pushy on ordering more wine. It seemed all they cared about is how to make most money of us.</body>

        <body>Me and my auntie went for a birthday meal and was not disappointed at all! We were greeted by the lovely staff and seated straight away. The waiter explained the menu to us and when we was stuck for choice of a cocktail, as there was so much to choose from, he gave great recommendations. The food was amazing, I had a Thai green curry and it was the best one I&apos;ve had yet! Food came promptly, no waiting around even though it was quite busy. When the bill came we were very surprised at how cheap the meal actually was, considering how nice the food is! I&apos;m very funny with using toilet facilities out, but the toilets were very clean which I was impressed with too!  I&apos;m so happy we chose to go to Mango Tree and will be going again very soon.</body>

        <body>The restaurant was good. Got in 15 mins late for a reservation and asked to wait. We waited another 20 mins before having to remind them to get us a table. Waitress was quite rude and unclear and attempted to charge us for something they did not have. We also got asked the reservation name midway through dinner since they couldn&apos;t remember. Food was good but service can do with improvement.</body>

        <body>This was my second visit to mango tree,  and I don&apos;t regret , service was really good, relaxed, polite, attentive and we specially loved the service from our head waiter, I would love to say her name but I am not really good at remembering names,   The only advice I would give is that the tables are too close to the others, talking about our table,,, we had to ask to the table next to us, to move a bit to be able to pass,  In conclusion, I definetly will go back, and is been highly recomended already to few friends.</body>

        <body>Booked this venue for our girls monthly get together. Lovely place and received a phone call to remind me of the booking prior to arrival.   Upon arrival we were ushered to the table which was set nicely. We were trying to talk and catch up with one another but kept on being interrupted by waiters which was a bit annoying and slightly rude. This must be to do with tables only being reserved for you for 2 hours however there must be a way to balance this and still give people privacy.   There was a good variety of food to choose from and what we choose was well presented and tasty. It was also served promptly.   We booked via open table to get 25% off staters and mains however at the end of our evening we were told the discount would not be applied to our mains because we ordered mains and desserts and the discount only applied if we ordered starter and mains together. This was not on the booking confirmation. A waiter told us this is in the fine print of the terms and conditions, agai</body>

        <body>Been to Mango several times. I find it to be a safe card when I got visitors from out of town as it&apos;s got something that will fit all (Asian) tastes and has a nice venue. Their 50% off makes it a good deal.</body>

        <body>The 50% off deal was what brought us here.  The first thing the waiter did was tell us that most of the menu was unavailable for us to select if we use the discount. Then pointed out some dishes that had 25% off instead (so, not included in the 50% offer).  Sides and puddings are not included in the deal and you have to eat a minimum of two courses - so a starter and a main. Dish sizes were small,  both starter and mains,  rice etc also was not generous.  Drinks are very expensive and represent poor value for money.  There is a two hour maximum at the table,  which we knew about and wasn&apos;t an issue,  but it adds to the feeling that you were being used as a cash cow - get you in to eat a very small selection of food and push you out as quickly as possible.</body>

        <body>Returning to a first-rate restaurant after three or four years absence can be disappointing but not in this case! Our return to The Mango Tree was an unqualified pleasure for us and a great joy for our daughter and son-in-law (serious foodies), who were there for the first time. The menu has been simplified (it used to be huge and complicated, albeit immensely interesting) but there is still ample choice over a good range. It&apos;s still possible to cover the full flavour spectrum of mild to extremely hot and sensible advice on choices was readily given. Beautifully presented, wonderfully flavoured food with friendly and attentive service and, particularly with a 50% off food offer, good value for money. Delighted to find that The Mango Tree has maintained it&apos;s high standard.</body>

        <body>This was a disappointing lunch for 2.  A good mixed seafood start was followed by 2 very small and very ordinary curries at a very expensive price.  Wine list is very expensive too.  With one glass of reisling and 2 bottles of water the bill was over £100.  Not good vfm at all and typical of an overpriced Belgravia restaurant</body>

        <body>VIsited with a friend on a 50% off food deal. Its rather complex due to the number of exclusions, including all specials, certain starters and mains, side orders, rice etc - but if you do it carefully, as we did, you can end up having a 2-course meal with glass of wine for around £25 per head. Service is attentive, and food of a high standard. Wine by the glass was very poor and overpriced.</body>

        <body>My experience at The Mango Tree was a very pleasurable one.  The quality and presentation of the food was impressive; the cocktails were great too: the &apos;birthday girl&apos; had &apos;Serendipity&apos;, my eldest had &apos;Elixir of Love&apos; and I had the &apos;Flowering Hibiscus&apos; (incidentally, each was selected by my youngest and each related to us on a very personal as well as spiritual level).  I found the service we received attentive, sensitive and compassionate and Sabi stood out in this regard. We were celebrating my youngest daughter&apos;s birthday and she got tearful at one point.  Sabi, without fuss, came over and unobtrusively presented a glass containing napkins for her and continued on his way.   The staff sang &apos;Happy Birthday&apos; to her,  and this felt genuine and uplifting.  The only thing that could have marred our experience was being charged twice for their special celebration cake.  I didn&apos;t realise until the next day and after a couple of attempts, got through to Cliff who, together with Satz, sorte</body>

        <body>Nice, clean place and helpful staff.  For lunch the atmosphere only really picks up after 1:30 however the mood is very hotel like.  It would be nice to have some soft music in the background.  The presentation is high end but this does make it a bit stuffy for the type of food being served.  Overall definitely at the better end of restaurants in London  Victoria and as 50% off for starter &amp; main is available it does make it more appealing for Lunch. Will definitely go back sometime this year.</body>

        <body>Having walked past many times and being impressed by the look of Mango Tree I finally had an occasion to book a table.   I wasn&apos;t disappointed, the staff were all pleasant and helpful; the atmosphere lovely; the food was amazing. We were fortunate to benefit from a special offer, but I would definitely be happy to pay full price next time I go.</body>

        <body>We had a very average dinning experience here.  I&apos;ll start with the positive (singular) - The cocktails were good.  Now the negatives: The service we received was lacking to say the least.  The waitress did not smile once and appeared completely disinterested in serving us.  There was one male member of staff who appeared more engaged and smiled but he was not our main server.  When we arrived, I made it clear we had to leave by 19.00 for a theatre booking.  They didn&apos;t get us to our table quickly.  Once seated, I mentioned to the aforementioned waitress our need to dine quickly and once again it feel on deaf ears.  When the food did arrive it was average at best.  I ordered the ka pow gai chicken as a main - It was bland and tasteless (apart from the chilli kick).  All in all, a really disappointing experience.  I was led to believe that the Mango tree was quite a nice restaurant - I was very much wrong. It felt more like a chain restaurant and I wonder if they have got distracted by</body>

        <body>First time at this restaurant, food was very nice and location is great, near to Victoria station etc. Service was speedy, food and drinks quite overpriced, we had a 25% discount, don&apos;t think I would have paid the prices advertised without the discount.</body>

        <body>Took my partner to Mango  Tree as she had never been there before and thought it would be ideal for a Valentines Day dinner. I hadn&apos;t been to Mango Tree for quite a few years but it was like i had never been away for long. The service was very good, the service was friendly and stayed professional,the cocktails where amazing and the food especially for my partner was 10/10 and we thoroughly enjoyed the whole evening. They even took pictures of us and other couples before seating them which was very nice.  I would recommend to friends who haven&apos;t been before and i will certainly take my partner there again.</body>

        <body>We had family visiting us and had to eat dinner near Victoria station. We told them that we were in hurry and they catered very well with quick yet smooth service. We were 4 and had 2 courses each with bottle of wine plus 2 soft drinks and 2 rice. Using 50% off deal bill came as 110 which I thought was good value. However, I wouldn&apos;t rush back as some of food was let down. Only worth when using deal and you HAVE to eat near Victoria station.</body>

        <body>The brasserie is one of those places where you feel you&apos;re eating above your price point.  Very good service, good food and a pleasant setting. We went on a lunch deal prior to a theatre show.  A good choice of options, inclusive of a glass of Kir Royale.  Ok, we added desert and some other extras, though the portion sizes were very good, so it bumped the price up a bit. Very enjoyable.</body>

        <body>A computer error meant our reservation was not processed but it did not matter - only one other table was taken.  We were shown to 2 tables which wobbled and then finally a 3rd which was ok.  The lunch menu was limited but offered good value and did have options we were happy with.  I chose the salad nicoise and my companion the lentil dish. Mine was fresh and plentiful, but the lentils looked unappetising despite being a huge portion.  Our starter of baked Brie was great but we decided to skip pudding.  All in a a fair meal for the price and the Resturant did get busier and have more atmosphere later in the afternoon.  Service could be more pleasant and less surly. I am not a grouch but the Resturant trade is tough, even in a popular central location. I am sure this would improve their business.</body>

        <body>We both loved our starters: French Onion Soup and Whole Tiger Prawns. A bit disappointed with my half chargrilled chicken which was dry but delighted to finish my partner&apos;s Duck Confit. The Bordeaux Superieur was excellent, we are both fond of red wine and my partner being a bit of a connoiseur was pleased with his find. We had enough by then, however decided to share the Passion fruit cheesecake: wish I had not eaten that much! It was a nice touch of the restaurant to bring a scooped ice cream with a lit candle and sing Happy Birthday &apos;dear customer&apos;. My partner was mortified, much to my amusement. We shall return to try other dishes we liked the sound of. Well done to all!!!</body>

        <body>I like it when you go to a place and you&apos;re wowed by the experience. The Palm Court lives up to it&apos;s reputation for me. Some of the practical bits: Parking was easy which for me as someone who drives every where is rather important. The service was very courteous. The food was excellent. Nothing pretentious. Just great food</body>

        <body>The PCB experience started with a courteous call as I stood in awe admiring the Elgin Marbles to say they were looking forward to seeing us later that afternoon. We duly arrived at the appointed time and were ushered to our table. The staff were welcoming, attentive, efficient and in one case positively charming! We had opted for the set menu pre theatre which included a Kir Royale, starting our meal with style. The food was nicely presented and more importantly tasted delicious. We didn&apos;t feel pressurised and had plenty of time to chat before moving on to the Opera House. The bill for 3 was very reasonable, great value for money; we will definitely be returning and not only to see the charming waiter!!</body>

        <body>This was our second visit since Christmas, and it did not disappoint.  Excellently situated for the theatres around Covent Garden, this lovely restaurant provides a warm welcome, swift service and very good food.  Not the most extensive menu, but a very balanced menu that caters to all tastes.  It is however very busy and I would never chance a &apos;walk in&apos; although they will do their best.</body>

        <body>This was a last minute find on Open Table as we were going to a comedy club in the area. The lighting was moody, maybe not ideal for everyone but was fine for our group.  The table was small for the amount on the table, but the staff were adept at prioritising what was on the tabke and it didn&apos;t spoil our evening. The food was lovely, service was good despite how busy it was and the value could not be disputed, we all came away from it content. All in all, a good find and would recimmend it</body>

        <body>This was my first visit to Palm Court Brasserie but definately not the last ! I regularly eat out in the various restaurants and brasseries of Covent Garden and in my view this is one of the best . Great food and good service set in a beautiful environment. Plenty of space around the table which is a huge advantage in this busy part of London</body>

        <body>Had lunch here on Saturday, busy and buzzy place just like a parisienne brasserie.  Food was delicious brasserie menu.  I had steak frites - just as it should be.  Made room for pudding as they sounded delicious and were. Our waiter was fabulous, efficient, funny, knowledgeable and good fun.  We all left very satisfied with lunch.  Would not hesitate to return here, have been to other brasseries in the area and felt ripped off, not here though.  Great!</body>

        <body>I had lunch here with friends and the set menu was quite nice.  However, as one of my group only wanted a main meal  we requested one from the  from the A La Carte menu, which we were happy to pay more for  We were then told that he could only do this if we all ate from the A La Carte.  Apparently they have one A La Carte menu and two set menus but everyone has to eat off the same menu which I found a bit bizarre.   So it&apos;s a great place for the set menu for a pre-theatre I guess.  The service was quite slow though so give yourself plenty of time.  The waitress was very nice.</body>

The staff could not be more pleasant and helpful, but are non-intrusive.  The menu is interesting, with a good choice and each time we eat there, the food is consistently good.

        <body>This was my partner and I&apos;s second visit to this restaurant; we first visited a little over 4 years ago on an early date. The food is still very good and the top table menu is excellent value, particularly by comparison to the main menu where one can order a main meal which has the same cost as the 2 course and Bellini top table menu. The setting is romantic, but the tables are a little close together so that one can overhear the conversations at your neighbouring tables. So not particularly private. The staff are friendly and attentive. Overall, recommended and worth a visit.</body>

        <body>A lovely restaurant but we were unfortunately seated right next to the till and the waiters were seemingly unaware how disturbing it was to have them crashing around and constantly bumping our chairs to squeeze past instead of walking round. We asked to move but our waiter said it wasn&apos;t possible so it felt chaotic and stressful rather than a chance to unwind and relax. The food was quite good but every time we asked our waiter for anything he said &apos;wait a minute&apos; and would then either forget or return 15 mins later.  When the bill came, we felt quite cheated to pay the 12.5% service charge. At weekends they should either reduce the charge to 10% in line with the level of service they are able to deliver or recruit more waiters so customers feel they are getting the level of service that warrants this. We did pay it though because it was clearly a reflection on the restaurant&apos;s management rather than our individual waiter who seemed stressed to his eyeballs!</body>

        <body>This is the 2nd time we have been here and this time it was my partner&apos;s 50th birthday meal.  We had the amazing value 22.90 for 3 courses and a kir royale.  It was brilliant.  All 8 of us were really pleased with the food, the service, the staff, the atmosphere.  I cant recommend this restaurant enough.  Not uppety but with a certain je ne sais quoi all the same.  We will be back.</body>

        <body>Booked the Palm Court Brasserie after reading positive reviews and we were not disappointed. Lovely welcome on arrival and offered various seating. Pleasant polite staff without being over bearing. We both chose off the pre theatre 3 course menu and each course was excellent. Very Reasonable price and would recommend and we will revisit again when in London.</body>

        <body>After a slightly faltering start we really enjoyed our visit to this restaurant. We had pre booked for 7.30pm for our wedding anniversary dinner. Lots of other people must have booked in for the same time and it took the already extremely busy waiting staff about 20 mins to take drinks orders.  Once things got started it all went very smoothly, with courteous friendly and attentive service, lovely food and a really attractive dining room. We&apos;d definitely go again but would maybe book in for a different time to avoid the 7.30 rush.</body>

        <body>Five of us visited the Palm Court Brasserie on Saturday evening to celebrate my Birthday. Following an early hiccup with some drinks the service was excellent as was the food. Although the restaurant is much larger than it initially appears from outside it retains an friendly but lively atmosphere. For a central London location the Palm Court Brasserie offers tremendous valve and guaranteed good night out..</body>

        <body>Very disappointed in food and service, even if the cover charge for bread and olives was waived to compensate. Wine was a different vintage year than on the wine list, we ordered a different wine and were charged for both bottles (caught that before we paid). Twoof us ordered steak (medium rare) frites and the steak was incredibly tough, hard to chew. Waited about 15 minutes before we could get waiter&apos;s attention to put in a coffee /dessert order. If there wasn&apos;t already a 12.5% gratuity included, i would not have left that much of a tip. The ambiance is great, the location is too, but so disappointed in food and service. With other French cafes in the area, i would give this one a miss.</body>

        <body>The restaurant is smaller than its grand name had  suggested - but is was a lovely  setting for a post-matinée meal with good friends.  The food was delicious and there was a good choice on the top table fixed price  menu. Service was good  but a little slow. Great value.</body>

        <body>Some good deals available, but we went for the a la carte menu. Good service and good food - always popular. Mix of French classics and some good fish options. Tables very closely packed though - not a place for private conversations!</body>

        <body>My friend and I thought we&apos;d &quot;try something new&quot;! Unfortunately, this place was not a pleasant surprise. The whole place is outdated, it really needs closing down and re-decorating ASAP! The air conditioning unit was not working so it was extremely hot, although restaurant was pretty much empty it still was uncomfortably hot. The waiter pointed out it was broken for a while and they &quot;may&quot; have to do something before the Summer...  The food was bland and it looked terrible on the plate. I had a duck leg on a bed of lentils - and yes, it looks like it sounds! Presentation &quot;zero&quot;, taste pretty much the same. Duck leg was dry and it tasted like it was cooked the day before. I am sorry, but it really was awful... Sorry guys, you are in the central London, Covent Garden to be precise, and you need to up your game if you&apos;re to survive! One very positive thing about the restaurant is the Staff, very friendly and accommodating.</body>

        <body>All good except car grilled chicken which was tasteless esp as  compared with Cote where the Brittany chicken is sweetand succulent. I wonder if Palm Court buyers. have gone for a cheaper option.Also, this was a pre- Coliseum supper and we get a complimentary Kir at COTE.</body>

        <body>Myself and my boyfriend had our pre theatre dinner here and it was absolutely devine, set in a great location it was nicely busy inside which added to the ambience we had starters, mains and a desert and a bottle of wine all in two hours with no rush at all, which was perfect as we had to get to the theatre. Couldn&apos;t recommend more highly, the service was fantastic and the food was delicious!</body>

        <body>We had a lunch booking for four people on a Saturday afternoon and had a thoroughly enjoyable time. Palm Court offers a relaxing dining environment, with decent food and excellent service that&apos;s attentive yet not overbearing. The mussels with frites and a side of roasted vegetables worked incredibly well (the waiter even brought over extra bread to mop up leftover jus) and were rather filling, so the Eton Mess for dessert was a bit too much, but still pretty tasty.  Word of advice: when booking, ask to have a table towards the back of the restaurant away from the till station and bar. We weren&apos;t disrupted much, but next time I&apos;ll definitely ask to be seated nearer the back of the restaurant.  In summary, a great place for lunch with friends. Relaxed, friendly, fair prices, and in the heart of London.</body>

        <body>I would usually be wary of restaurants in the Covent Garden area, but this was recommended by a friend and didn&apos;t disappoint. The pre theatre menu is incredibly reasonable (£14 for 2 courses, £17 for 3 courses) and the food was very tasty. They staff were also very aware of our time constraints and the food came out promptly. I would certainly visit again.</body>

        <body>A couple of months ago, we had an excellent meal at Palm Court. This time was a complete let down. I had the steak frites both times and on this occasion the cut of meat was sub-par and a bit fatty. I ordered garlic butter and it arrived barely melted. It was like a cream that never melted.  And to charge £1.25 for it ridiculous. My husband had the T-bone and the peppercorn sauce was like a thick gravy. Our side of green beans were so overcooked they were wilted and sad. It was busy and we couldn&apos;t flag the waiter down so we just ate as we had a show to attend. At the end, we did express our disappointment. The waiter was very understanding, apologetic and passed the feedback onto the manager. We hoped that dessert would be better as the Chocolate Pot was amazing the last time! Alas, it was burnt on the top and the tuille cookie was thick and rock hard. It was kind for the waiter to take our dessert and coffee off the bill. We appreciated his effort. This was a Monday pre-theatre dinn</body>

        <body>The food was very good, my wife had a starter of tiger prawns in garlic butter and I had the duck and pork terrine, our mains were tuna nicoise salad and honey glazed pork all of which were excellent. The service was very good and we can especially recommend the Palm Court for pre-theatre meals.</body>

        <body>We were astonished at the price of our meal. We were planning on the pre theatre menu which we had for the first course and  we then asked the waitress how much it would be to have the pancakes and we were told that it would then be £10.95 for the main course plus £5.95 for the pancakes plus £3 for potatoes = 19.90  = Total 38.40 so where did a bill for more tan £64 come from. Sadly we will not use your restaurant again.</body>

        <body>This was our fourth visit to this restaurant over a number of years, and we were pleased to find that the standards are being maintained.  We had an early evening booking on a Saturday,  and the venue was packed. Service was excellent and the food well cooked. Sea bass was very moist, and the lamb rump cooked exactly to my wife&apos;s asking. As we left, the manager commented to us that he&apos;d recognised us from our previous visits, even though our last time was over a year ago.  All in all a very nice restaurant which offers good value for money.  The only criticism is that it was a little dark.. Will definitely be back.</body>

        <body>Been here a few times now feels like you&apos;re somewhere expensive but the fixed price menu is good value although be careful not to order a side by mistake that&apos;s extra and not well explained however the kind manager removed it from our bill. Great for a romantic lunch or catching up with a girlfriend. Enjoy!</body>

        <body>My friends &amp; I regularly meet up at the Palm Court for lunch to celebrate our birthdays.We  all live in various different home counties &amp; it makes an ideal central location that&apos;s easy for us all to get too. The service is always very friendly &amp; yet professional. Lots of choice for food even with the special offer menues &amp; the prosecco is also very reasonably priced which is a must have for a girlie lunch.  Would thoroughly recommend,  don&apos;t look any further.</body>

        <body>We had the set menu which included a glass of Kir. Nice selection as always. The starters were really very nice however the main (beef bourgeon) was quite poor. The sauce had a lovely deep flavour, but the meat was very chewy. We both had the same and we both found this to be the case. The waiters response was not ideal, telling us that he would inform the chef, but that still left us with little to eat for our main. However, I have eaten here before and this is the first time I have had a bad meal.</body>

        <body>I&apos;d been wanting to try Palm Court Brasserie for ages and after this first visit I wasn&apos;t disappointed. The service was amazing. The staff were really friendly, patient and attentive. Each course was delivered quickly and efficiently. There was a nice buzz about the restaurant and despite it&apos;s location, it wasn&apos;t overly busy.  The food overall was very good. The only slight disappointment was the duck and pork terrine which was cold and quite hard meaning it could not be placed on the toast. The main courses and deserts were excellent. Great flavours, well cooked and thoughtfully presented.  My only gripe about the restaurant was how dark it was.  As the light faded outside, the restaurant lights seemed to get dimmer. Hardly anyone could see the menu or the food. I think that  would prevent me going back again and it spoilt the evening a bit.</body>

        <body>My fiance and I visited the restaurant on Saturday 28th February after having seen Dirty Rotten Scoundrels at the Savoy Theatre. The restaurant has a great location and as you are able to book a late table it is perfect for a post theatre dinner. We had the a la carte menu and the food was good although our chateaubriand steak was a bit tough and cooked medium rare rather than medium. This was not a problem for me as that&apos;s how I like it but my partner was disappointed. As we were eating late we didn&apos;t want to complain. Having said this the service was excellent and the ambience was very nice. We would visit again.</body>

        <body>Food  very average. Waiters nice. Service became slow when the restaurant got busy,  and consequently we were late for theatre. Nonetheless, the staff were courteous. I don&apos;t think we would return, however, due to the standard of the food.</body>

        <body>This was the first time eating here and was very happy with food and service.  Very friendly &amp; attentive staff (we had a lovely Italian waiter from Puglia who was most excellent).  The four of us ate from the Set Menu and the beef bourguignon was superbly rich and very tender.  Really lovely.  Duck and the Risotto were also ordered and all parties really enjoyed their meal.   We had the two bottles of the house wine and altogether it made for perfect ambiance of eating with friends;.  Great service, lovely seating and in no way were we rushed whatsoever, which I thought might be the case given it was a Pre Theatre and in the middle of Covent Garden.  The bill was very reasonable and would highly recommend.</body>

        <body>This was our first visit to the Palm Court Brasserie and it certainly won&apos;t be our last.  From the second we walked through the day the service from our waiter, Marcos, was excellent.  He was very attentive and efficient. We chose from the pre theatre menu because it seemed to be excellent value and we were not disappointed...great portions of delicious food and they were very quick too which suited us because we were en route to a show. I cannot fault anything about our visit and would wholeheartedly recommend it (and already have done) to anyone. Congratulations!</body>

        <body>I had a business lunch with a colleague at the restaurant last week, a venue I had visited on several occasions previously. The cuisine was variable and not reflective of previous standards. The service was in general disappointing compared with previous visits, and several waiters could have been more helpful.</body>

        <body>One of our favourites.  The Boeuf Bourguignon was good but not quite as good is in the past. There were quite a lot of &apos;stringy bits&apos;  The Burgundy was good.  The duck pate was good. Overall a pleasant experience.</body>

        <body>I booked Palm Court Brasserie as a surprise for a friend who is a huge fan of French food. We had a wonderful time, all the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and the food was delicious. I have to admit, it may also have been the best cappuccino in town (as the waiter told me). Great place for a pre theatre meal.</body>

        <body>Went for Sunday lunch with my wife and daughter.  We had the Mother&apos;s Day special set menu, which was very good value for money including a Bellini and three course meal.  Tasty food, good sized portions and plenty of choice on the menu.  Bustly atmosphere, but not too noisy and very friendly helpful staff.   Highly recommended for a relaxed meal with friends or family.</body>

        <body>The waiters were very attentive as I was the first to arrive from our party and they made sure I had something to drink and also brough me some water. My friends has the fish and chips as the main course and said it was good. We also all liked the tiger prawn starter, it was very nice with the garlic butter. However, my main that I was looking so much forward to as I was starving was quite a let down. I had the chargrilled chicken and fries with chasseur sauce, but the chicken was so dry that the little pot of sauce could not save it. Quite disappointing. It was all in all an okay meal we had, but would probably not visit again.</body>

        <body>Superb location, just right for a post-theatre meal. We have used the Palm Court on several occasions after a Saturday theatre matinee and have always been delighted with the pleasant reception, service and food quality. Good value for central London. We will certainly be going again when next in London</body>

        <body>This place is a real gem.  The decor echoes a cosy French Brasserie and the staff we met were all French, so it&apos;s easy to forget you&apos;re in the centre of London and not in Paris. The menu offers typical brasserie fare at typical brasserie prices. The food was good, and of equivalent quality to other  brasserie style restaurants in Central London that are a lot more expensive, so this place offered real value for money. The staff were all very friendly and struck a good balance between being attentive and helpful and allowing you to get on with your meal. I will definitely be going back.</body>

        <body>This was a first time visit by myself and my partner and from the minute we walked through the door it was not only a pleasure to be there and to partake of the food and the ambience but also to interact with the very attentive staff and other diners. It helped that there was confusion over my name as they originally confused me with Sean Connery at first and after that the evening just got better and better. The food was excellent, the wine superb and the cocktails suggested my the team were divine. If you ever fancy eating at a smart restaurant where the food and ambience is excellent and the service wonderful you should try Palm Court. We shall be returning there very soon. Five stars all around.</body>

        <body>My wife and I have visited London annually and 3 years ago found this restaurant. We have eaten there ever since and almost certainly will go again next year. Despite being a very busy place we have always been treated in a very friendly manner, food and drink have been spot on. A good place to eat.</body>

        <body>We booked a 5pm pre-Theatre supper. Very friendly efficient service. Excellent value for money meal with 2 or 3 courses. Our daughter went a la Carte and had a superb steak.</body>

        <body>Nice restaurant with good food and service but don&apos;t go here with someone softly spoken and expect to be able to hear what they are saying as even early on a Friday evening it got rather too noisy.  Probably better at a less busy time.</body>

        <body>This place has a great buzz to it and friendly, efficient staff. We had the £17.50 two courses incl a Kir Royale which was extremely good value and a reasonable choice for a set menu. The confit de canard with lentils was very good, as was the salmon nicoise (they&apos;d run out of tuna but still offered the salmon alternative rather than taking it off the menu), definitely recommended for pre or post theatre.</body>

        <body>We had a lovely meal on a Saturday night - the waiters were very good and the food was very good indeed.   The only gripes I have are that its very dark (even the women wearing glasses on table next to us had trouble reading the menu) and you are a bit squished to the table next to you.  I had the steak frites and it could have done with a bit of green stuff ie watercress or rocket and the garlic and herb butter would have been better unmelted.   Apart from that it was lovely thankyou.</body>

        <body>Have been several times now to this restaurant and have not been disappointed. The staff are very friendly.  On the most recent  occasion when we were undecided over which wine to choose (and we only wanted to order by the glass!) they brought three samples for us to try.  The Open Table special deals seem good value for money.  Gets busy pre-theatre but always a good atmosphere.</body>

        <body>Our first time visit to  the Palm Court Brasserie to meet up with old friends was really enjoyable. It has a buzzy ambiance-  and the friendly service, varied menu and good food make it an excellent find.  All pretty reasonably priced too for its location, near the piazza in Covent Garden. We shall definitely return.</body>

        <body>What a treat, we went pre-theatre and had their 3 course deal . It was excellent value and so tasty. The staff were so attentive and even went as far as to plan our route to the theatre. I would recommend this to anyone look for atmosphere, value for money and good service. I will definitely come back my next London visit.</body>

        <body>Had mentioned on booking that it was my daughters birthday. On bringing out her sweet, complete with candle, 3 waiters sang Happy Birthday and everyone enjoyed their &apos;Happy Birthday Dear... Customer&apos; ending !  Meal was very good, particularly my roast beef, big in both taste and portion.  We both felt the daughters pork would have benefited with roast  potatoes included in advertised dish.   Other than that, a very good experience and will be visting again soon.</body>

        <body>I first went to Palm Court Brasserie on my very first date with my husband of 28 years - I still have the same husband but bizarrely we have never been back to the PCB.  I cannot think why!    The food is good, the portions not overwhelming, the waiters are very friendly and attentive enough  (but they don&apos;t overdo it) and the whole place deserves to be as full as it was on the Wednesday night I went.    I shall not wait another 28 years.</body>

        <body>Everything you expect from a brasserie, and well placed for pre-theatre dining, about 150m from the ROH. Low level lighting and candles, even at 5.30, made for an intimate atmosphere. Busy, but still possible to converse easily. We abandoned the top table offer as there were so many treats on the à la carte; we chose French onion soup, lobster thermidor, moules marinière.  The lobster was a half, and not huge but acceptable for the price ( In London !) and very tasty.  Service was friendly and nicely timed. Need to go back to try the fish soup !</body>

        <body>We had arranged to meet a friend for lunch, we were greeted really well when we arrived. we were then shown to our table. The table was practically in the centre isle of the restaurant, which meant the person sitting on the outside was in the way of the serving staff and other customers. to the credit of the restaurant we asked to be moved and we were sat further down the centre isle but this was a little better. The service was not as attentive as it could have been, again back to the table which was on an  uneven section of the floor, we asked for something to balance it up and this did not happen until we asked another server 10 minutes later, to his merit he did it straight away.  The food was good and excellent value, we will dine there again as this is our third time, and the only time we have had any issues, perhaps it was a busy day!!</body>

        <body>Booked lunch at  Palm Court brasserie with friends before the theatre. We wanted to have a leisurely lunch but the service was a bit too brisk! Kir to start was lovely and the starters were OK. Mains were good - but the confit of duck was very salty. Desert was the best - the cheescake was amazing. All in all a nice meal and good value.</body>

        <body>I was looking for a restaurant to take an elderly friend for a pre-theatre dinner before going to the Royal Ballet. I looked at trip-advisor and saw a lot of good reviews for the Palm Court Brasserie, and that, combined with its menu selection and close proximity to the Opera House, confirmed my choice. We arrived much earlier than our booking time, but it was no problem. The service was excellent and so friendly, and there is a nice ambience.  We had carrot and ginger soup and  a generous portion of sea bass (which can often be absolutely tiny) with a delicious basil and tomato sauce and lots of green beans. The side order of dauphinoise potatoes was very moreish and it was nice to have the choice of something a bit different form the usual new potatoes or chips. The dessert list looked lovely, but I managed to stick to my diet and had a decaf cappuccino instead. I was very happy with my choice, as my friend thoroughly enjoyed it. The ladies&apos; loos were also very nice and gave the opt</body>

        <body>Visited before Back Stage Tour at ROH at lunch time, hence only two courses selected from the set menu. Excellent Beef Bourguginion for me and Burger for my husband. Portion size could have been slightly bigger for me, as it was delicious. Will be returning to experience an evening meal soon!</body>

        <body>We really enjoyed our visit to Palm Court Brasserie, it was for a treat for my parents and they were thrilled with it. The food was good, the service was excellent and we felt very well taken care of. It was a memorable visit and I will definitely recommend it to people.</body>

        <body>Had 3 course set-menu with glass of bubbles. Not a huge choice for a set menu but adequate enough with something from each course covering most palates. Food was of a generous portion size and tasty. Our server was particularly on form and very punctual and accommodating. We found the temperature a little to hot in there but they kindly assisted by adjusting it. All in all I am never disappointed here, its nice to have a place like this which is value for money and not too formal whilst being in the heart of the West End.</body>

The waiters were friendly and attentive although we did have remind them on a couple of items we ordered that were forgotten . Once  that was sorted the food came quickly and was a high standard .

I was early but sat at the table quite happily and was not hassled to order at all . Very attentive service and the food was really, really good. Excellent.</body>

        <body>For such a busy location (Covent Garden Piazza) the Palm Court Brasserie has  a good &apos;buzzy&apos; atmosphere, the food is good, the the service is attentive. The only minor down-side is that there is no bar so there&apos;s no opportunity for a pre-meal drink. There are, however, plenty of bars in the area to which we were directed (we turned up early). When we returned at the pre-booked time, our table was ready. Overall a really enjoyable evening.</body>

        <body>My daughter and I had a lovely  Sunday dinner at The Palm.  This was our special dinner and one we both will never forget ! Our dinner was incredible and presentation just mouth watering. My dish of mussels and cream left me wanting to know how I could make that sauce.  My daughter&apos;s dish of seafood pasta was also full and lovely to taste .  I would recommend an evening there for everyone visiting  London.   Our server was great at being there when we needed and made nice dinner suggestions.</body>

        <body>Been there twice before and meal has always been good however this time we were really disappointed. We had the lobster Thermidor which was tough and overdone, the chips were simply not cooked. The sweet was burned ( creme brulee). The service however was good and the waiter as always made us feel welcome, such a shame about the food.</body>

        <body>We&apos;ve booked the Palm Court Brasserie as a post theatre dinner Saturday at 22.00. It is a fairly easy menu with mostly classic dishes.However there was no fish option for main course on the day of our visit. If the food was reasonably well executed but the desserts. The service or rather the lack of it make us feel we were disturbing. The menu say complementary kir royal why ask me if I want an aperitif. If I order a bottle of red and ask to have it open to breath don&apos;t come 10mn later asking us if we wanted wine with our meal come on guys get your act together.  During our meal our waiter have been more busy clearing and setting up the empty table in the restaurant than the only table in is section that had guests. We had to pour our ENTIRE  bottle of wine ourself during our dinner at no point did our waiter even notice that our glasses need to be refilled. Funny enough the food runner as been the most hospitable and efficient person during our dinner I wish I could have tip him. The</body>

        <body>We went to the Palm Court pre theatre and was so disappointed with the service or lack of it.  Waited ages for waiter to attend us as clearly we were in invisable to him.  Starters were good, but they forgot to bring the peas during the main course and then forget to bring my tea at the end of the meal. With so many excellent restaurants in the area, we will not be going back. By the way ,we choose A la Carte as the pre theatre menu did not appeal.  So if you want to avoid terrible service leave Palm Court well alone.</body>

        <body>We absolutely loved out recent visit!  The staff there were magnificent: very attentive and relaxed, yet professional and not too pesky.   Food was delicious and plentiful! Our mains (butternut squash ravioli &amp; grilled seabass) was sufficient enough for a full meal and absolutely gorgeous. But being very greedy we also got desserts and their Creme Brulee was to die for.  The best thing about the place was it&apos;s ambiance and design! While really busy and vibrant it didn&apos;t feel to crowded and tiring. Dim lighting made the place feel very nice and cosy, yet still allowing to see the gorgeous dishes on your plate. Perfect for both: busy family/friends meal or romantic dinner.  My only criticism would be their cocktails: we had a Kir Royale and it was far too sweet and tasted sugary, as if the bubbly was mixed with very cheap syrup.</body>

        <body>We went to Palm Court for early pre theatre dinner and it did not disappoint! We had the £17 Kir Royale offer and it was perfect!  We were seated right down the back in a beautiful area that looked like a courtyard garden. The staff were attentive and friendly and the food was wonderful.  I had the boeuf which was served in its own little crick pot with mash in a separate dish. It was hot and delicious with plenty of meat.  I would highly recommend this restaurant not just for theatre meals. It&apos;s location just off Covent Garden and it&apos;s friendly staff make it my go to place now. Thanks</body>

        <body>Me and the wife were in London for our wedding anniversary and I spent a very long time trying to find a restaurant that suited me and my wife&apos;s criteria. She tends to like her food simple with minimal fuss and not too expensive whereas I&apos;m the opposite.  And to that end the Palm Court Brasserie certainly did that. The menu had enough selection for both our needs. She had deep fried brie, moules mariniere and creme brule. I had chicken liver and fois gras parfait, lobster thermidor and an espresso cocktai.  All was beautifully cooked, especially the huge chunky chips that accompanied my lobster and was nicely presented. The service was attentive but not obtrusive. The only thing letting it down was the table layout; we did seem rather crammed in but it was a very busy Saturday night.</body>

        <body>The Palm Court was recommended to us and we were delighted to meet with our friends in such a relaxed restaurant in Covent Garden.  The staff were excellent and were in no rush for us to leave.   All our meals were of a very high standard and enjoyed by all.  We will certainly go back again and look forward to the next time.</body>

        <body>Dinner at Palm Court Brasserie was the worst dining experience I&apos;ve had in London for the last ten years. I don&apos;t usually leave reviews, especially negative ones, but in this case I feel I need to warn the public and hopefully prompt some improvement to the restaurant management. I went there with a friend, and was extremely embarrassed for having chosen this place. I was welcomed at the entrance with the words: &quot;Hello lady&quot;, which I didn&apos;t pay much attention to at the time, though I should have. We ordered the pre-theatre meal with a glass of wine each. The food was awful, not just bad, the white wine was served warm. Both the soup and the salmon made an impression of a low quality ready-made meal from a grocery store, ice cream was also the most basic. Our waiter did attend to us and food arrived quickly, but he wasn&apos;t friendly at all and in general behaved in a rather unwelcoming manner. We paid £60,  you can have a decent meal for this money in many places in the area. While the e</body>

        <body>The decor and lighting made for a lovely mood for a quiet evening to do fine dining for an affordable price. Service was great and location was easy to find. The fact that we got to use a 2FOR1 offer made the experience even better, it made high quality food and atmosphere accessible and affordable.</body>

        <body>We thoroughly enjoyed our pre-theatre meal at the Palm Court Brasserie. It was good value and despite the fact that we took advantage of the special open table.co.uk set menu there was a good range of choice. My partner is a vegetarian and she had a choice of two starters and two mains on the set menu (there was more available to  pescetarians). We liked the atmosphere and the decor... It was quaint with a retro vibe, and although it was fairly small, the tables were not to close together. On the whole it was a very nice meal, well cooked and value for money. Especially as far as London goes.</body>

        <body>The restaurant is very nice and the staff are very courteous.  The restaurant however is too dark inside, they need to turn the lights up.  I only need glasses for occasional reading but even with my glass on, I couldn&apos;t read the menu, nor could my daughter who is 18 and has perfect eyesight.  We had to use the &quot;torch&quot; facility on our mobile phones to read the menu which is a shame. The food was very nice, the service however was rather slow as the restaurant was busy. We did not get our bread as this was forgotten about which again, was a shame. We would go there again for a pre-theatre meal.</body>

Wide menu to choose from, we had Chicken Parfait followed by beautifully cooked Lamb then Chocolate Pot and a Fruit Panacotta from the specials list.. Will have to keep visiting to take another dip into the choices available. Staff brilliant - never far away but not at all intrusive and very friendly The wine list is great value and extensive.</body>

        <body>I always go back to Palm Court as you are guaranteed a fantastic meal in lovely surroundings! We ate from the pre theatre menu which is outstanding value at £13.99 for 2 courses. The food was great as always and the staff can&apos;t do enough to help you. The a la carte menu is also fantastic if you fancy a broader choice.Highly recommended!</body>

        <title>Quaglino&apos;s - London</title>
        <body>Quaglino?s, the iconic restaurant and late-night venue in the heart of London?s Mayfair, has undergone an extensive make over at the hands of Russell Sage Studio and brings a contemporary European menu from Executive Head Chef Mickael Weiss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The venue also boasts not one, but two exciting bars ? a glamorous central cocktail bar in the heart of the main dining room and Quaglino?s classic mezzanine bar overlooking the restaurant ? both serving tipples with a taste of the past, heavily focusing on classic and champagne cocktails, while the 300 bin wine list showcases a balanced mix of Old and New World references. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in the evening, the restaurant transforms into a late-night, live-music mecca; one of the only venues in Mayfair open to the public with a late-night license and free entry, perfect for partying into the early hours.  &lt;br /&gt;</body>

        <body>After seeing the pictures and reading the reviews about quaglinos I was actually quite hesitant....but that was all put to rest once I arrived....what An amazing place it literally feels like your in goodfellas! The crowd is very glam mixture of city workers and older people dolled up, the music is a bit too loud and full on I found it hard to hear my partner over conversation. The service was brilliant always catered to and look after and even though the food is on the small portion side it&apos;s reasonable and good! defo worth a visit if you want something glam and special!</body>

        <body>We returned for dinner here after its refurbishment.   The service was excellent throughout the evening, with our only quibble being the over-attentive pouring of the wine!   Both starters and main dishes were well presented, and I went as far as having a dessert.   Wine list exhaustive. and our choice of House Red being quite acceptable.  We will not leave it so long before we return.</body>

        <body>This place must be a huge money-suck. The venue is massive and, from what I understand, recently renovated. The staff are dressed in long, gaudy gold and black dresses. Down on the main floor, there&apos;s a stage at one end that opens up at 10pm to reveal some poor DJ bopping around from behind a set of decks. A singer and saxophone come later. The clientele are 40+ trying to live out the glory days of their youth at a place that was relevant in the 90s. The food isn&apos;t worth a mention.</body>

        <body>Took friends out for dinner at Quaglinos. Great atmosphere and were asked if we&apos;d like to move to the tables in front of the stage. We agreed. Everything was fine; service and initial waiters/waitresses were good. However, when the bill came they added on a charge for shifting tables. We weren&apos;t told about this throughout the meal and the waitress didn&apos;t take it off when asked what the charge was for. I assume the waiters shifts had changed and the one taking our payment wasn&apos;t pleasant to talk to. It was embarrassing as it was our treat for guests. Anyway, we paid the bill and the surplus. As if that wasn&apos;t bad enough, my mother later got food poisoning. I assume from the salmon.</body>

        <body>Quaglino&apos;s has been on my list to attend for a while and I wasn&apos;t disappointed. I really enjoyed the 1930&apos;s decor (with a slight modern twist), the lighting and ambiance was just right too.   The food even from the set menu was varied enough to provide a good selection for everyone, the pork cheek starter was cooked to perfection and the chicken couldn&apos;t have been better.   I found the staff to be some of the most attentive and well mannered I have had the pleasure to experience in a good few years having found a lot of restaurants to veer into neglecting this aspect somewhat.  My only disappointment was that we were not going to be staying for the live music which started at 10pm on the stage at the far end of the dining area but we had a show to go to.  All in all I would recommend Quaglino&apos;s highly on my list to visit if ever asked to provide a suggestions for excellent restaurants.</body>

        <body>Met a friend for lunch here one Saturday afternoon on an OpenTable special which proved good value for money. Had we paid full price, I would have been disappointed. Overall the experience was good, but not amazing. Food was nice but nothing outstanding.  I would have expected something a little more special for such a long-standing and well known establishment.</body>

        <body>This was the first time I&apos;ve been to Quaglino&apos;s for years but I must say it was a great choice! I took my two brothers as we were celebrating one of us getting a new job and it delivered the lovely evening we were after. The food was excellent, only one small negative that one of our steaks quite gristly, but everything else was very good including desserts. Service was friendly, warm and professional and the live music that came on later made for a great atmosphere (although would be fantastic if you could start this earlier say 9:9:30pm?!)  I know they had a refurb last year, the decor is lovely and gives the place a 1950&apos;s kind of glamour. Will definitely be returning soon!</body>

        <body>We came here some years ago and chose it as a posh dinner with friends as it was so good the first time.  We were early but the bar music was pounding so chose to go to the table where we ordered cocktails.  the waitress was insistent that we order our food quickly and when we objected another lady with an Ipad told us we only had the table for 2 hours so we could go to the bar and wait for 9 pm or order our food.  We told her we&apos;d order just as soon as we got some drinks!  The food was well presented, although the pork belly was a disappointment.  After 2 1/2 hours we got the bill and left to have coffee in a café down the street.  being 2 feet from a saxophone horn left conversation impossible!  We wrote an email to the manager and received a lengthy and charming apology advising that they had spoken to the people in question and offered a free bottle of drink should we come back.  Can&apos;t fault this response and commend them on their professional attitude.  Maybe we just had an off n</body>

        <body>Due to a diary mistake I only had 50 minutes for lunch.  The staff were fantastic - took our order straight away, food came quickly, and we were done in time.  Fabulous, attentive, professional service, exactly what&apos;s needed for a business lunch.  The environment is lovely.  Very sumptious and impressive - a grand walk down to the restaurant, ornate without being tacky.  Atmosphere a bit lacking.  Very large restaurant but only half full and all diners sitting in one half.  Food was mostly very good but felt a bit underwhemling given the grandness of the setting.  My guest had Mackerel starter which he described as &quot;different&quot; in not an entirely fab way.  I had duck egg and asparagus.  Again, it was &quot;different&quot;.  The duck egg was barely poached - lots of uncooked white.  I&apos;m not a big fan of that.  And the asparagus on the plate was neither hot nor cold.  I wasn&apos;t sure if it was deliberately warm or had just been left out a bit long.  My starter lacked substate to mop up the very runn</body>

        <body>I came across Qauglino&apos;s while looking for inspiration to take some friends out to dinner.  I was extremely pleased with the dining experience.  I would only fault the restaurant for a very ordinary transition from table to bar area in order to make way for the next sitting.  It was quite disorganised.  Also, the bartenders substitute of champagne in a Jaegermeister bomb in place of Red Bull was a waste of champagne and possibly the worst drink we had ever had.</body>

        <body>It&apos;s the venue of this restaurant that made the night so enjoyable, its sleek and classy.  The 3 courses with sparkling wine for £27 was actually fairly good value for money, the food portions were very good for a top end restaurant like this. The food was certainly good, not outstanding but very flavoursome and presented very elegantly. I would certainly recommend this restaurant to any couples. Only criticism would be how one feels a bit rushed when eating by the staff, before you&apos;ve almost finished the course they are wanting to take it off you and give you the next.</body>

        <body>I came in with my partner and my parents to celebrate my birthday this week. We booked with the three course set menu which was very good value. The food was excellent and the service was very good. I find in some higher quality restaurants that they can often make you feel unwelcome ad uncomfortable, but that was definitely not the case. The only fault I had was with the ambience. They had live music on during the end of our meal, described as &quot;loungey&quot;, which would have been lovely, but it was just a little too loud and made conversation difficult.</body>

I&apos;ve been to quaglinos 3 times now on a Friday night and it is really great for a special occasion the only drawback is that if you are on an offer they tend to hurry you along quicker than if you weren&apos;t on a set menu.

        <body>I have been a few times to Quaglino&apos;s and never had a complaint. Indeed last time I gave it a rave review but the circumstances were very different (Christmas lunch).   This time I made the huge error of booking the Open Table special&apos; menu. Quaglino&apos;s apparently don&apos;t like us paupers eating at their restaurant, as the Open Table Menu consists of stupidly mean portions - perhaps to make sure that next time you order A la Carte. The first course of smoked salmon was two sad slices (in  what looked liked pre-cut rectangles) and the main course of  pork fillet was delicious but  literally three mouthful-sized pieces of meat ( this level of portion control reduced our table to a fit of the  giggles and talk of a trip to MacDonald&apos;s afterwards). They make sure you buy side dishes - indeed our waiter explained how small the portions are. It all adds up - in the end my bill for four came to £290 - and we ordered the  £27 per head set menus. The cost of sides, water and coffee came to £50. Ad</body>

        <body>We had the months set menu which had a great choice of delicious dishes. My friend was very surprised and very grateful. The restaurant brought her desert out with a candle and happy birthday writing in chocolate on the plate. All three of us enjoyed it.</body>

        <body>We took a client there for an important but relaxed lunch. Great atmosphere, great service and great food all helped to make it a very enjoyable and productive meeting. Would definitely recommend and go again. Plus Opetable had a 25% discount off food!</body>

        <body>I know some people have rated it as poor value for money - I disagree. Best tasting food I have ever had. Going back again very shortly. Every course was delicious, staff were very attentive, decor 1920&apos;s speakeasy. Only criticism is the cost of drinks.</body>

        <body>I went to Quaglinos the first time a few weeks ago with 2 friends and had the dinner deal for £30 which I raved about for weeks to friends and family. Went again on the day before Valentine&apos;s with my partner on a normal a la carte menu and we both left disappointed and not impressed and will definitely not rush to go back food wise. Entertainment and cocktails menu etc up to scratch.</body>

        <body>I visit here about 2-3 times a year with the same group of friends. We always go for evening standard offer, or theatre menu, or fixed price menu. This time I had 2 courses for £21 although there was also 3 courses and glass of wine for £27. Had bread to start whilst others had starters. Very tasty bread! My main was salmon on a bed of vegetables with some kind of lemon thyme foam. Not sure if the foam really added anything but the salmon and vegetables were very nice. We shared some side dishes between the five of us which always works well. Good choice of side vegetables. For pudding I had creme brulee which was lovely and a decent size. Cost £27 for my meal plus proportion of 4 mains and service charge. The service was good here except for the end when we all needed to go and all the waiters were very busy setting tables etc for the evening. But generally the service was excellent and waiters were very polite and attentive. The new decor is quite a contrast to before. I miss the am</body>

        <body>I had read  good reviews about this place and decided to invite my friend for her birthday with an evening set menu. I specified tiwce it was a special occasion and that I was hoping we could add a candle on her dessert. They confirmed they would do their best to find us a nice table and that they would write &quot;happy bithday&quot; on her dessert. I was quite pleased. When we arrived, reception was not very welcoming but the staff at the bar was nicer. Then, they brought us to our table which was a bit squizzed among other tables. I was a bit dissapointed but I could understand they might have not managed to find a nicer table. The service was ok, however not what you would expect from a place like this. Friendly but not very welcoming. The food was surprisingly average (the goat cheese salad &amp; salmon lacked flavour). The creme brulee was however very nice. The music (for which you pay an extra £6) was agreable (not too loud). My disappointment also came when they actually didn&apos;t do anything</body>

        <body>The service was poor. We arrived late, we had called to inform the restaurant and all they kept doing was repeating that we would not be able to have the offer. This was again an issue for the restaurant when we arrived. They completely unprofessional. The service thereafter was still poor and so was the food.

        <body>Celebratory drinks &amp; dinner with some friends were perfect at Quaglino&apos;s.  The service was excellent; friendly. discrete &amp; efficient.  Food was delicious - we all had trouble choosing a single option from the menu, every plate was enjoyed. The atmosphere was the perfect level of buzzy yet intimate, and the surroundings are wonderful. We had a fabulous time and will certainly be going back again. Definitely recommended!</body>

        <body>Quaglinos reopened to great fanfare recently, but other than a slightly darker paint job, not much has changed. The menu is paint by numbers for the local business and tourist crowd but hits the spot, and the set menu is great value. Service was cheerful. The only thing lacking was daylight...</body>

The service from when we first arrived was outstanding, very attentive but not intrusive. Food was great. we were not rushed and took our time, had a few more drinks at the bar after the meal. Yes it is expensive, it was a treat and on this occasion worth every penny.</body>

        <body>Well, the food was great, especially good value due to the special offer. The special menu is good, there were fish and meat options. But...there were 4 different people serving us and they would come up and interrupt the conversation, I understand they tried very hard etc. and there should be a waiter, a sommelier etc, but it got to a point that I was about to explode and ask them to leave us alone. They would come and ask if we have chosen the food, wine, then again, then after we have ordered with a waiter, another person would come and ask, it just seemed they were rushing us badly (though I kept an yet on the watch as I knew we had only 2 hours). And would have been nice if we were warned that there would be a charge for live music added to our bill!!!</body>

        <body>Dinner at Quaglino&apos;s on Friday 27, March 2015 with two friends. We choose the set menu and the wine  &quot;bubbly&quot; which the waiters/waitresses kept referring to, was basic - nothing special or bubbly at all!! What should have been a relaxing enjoyable evening with friends was, to say the least, a complete disappointment.  In total, we had between 6-7 different waiters and waitresses serving us, it was totally unbelievable.  The food was good, but due to the service we did not leave the service charge added to the bill.    Not a wonderful experience , not sure what the problem was, BUT, we will not be coming back any time soon!!!</body>

        <body>Extremely enjoyable vist to Quaglino&apos;s on Friday 10 April. The service - from arrival to leaving - was spot on.  We chose from the 3 course and glass of fizzy wine menu.  Choices were good and stand out dishes were pork (pig&apos;s ear) with mash starter,  chicken main course and two sweets (cheesecake and some kind of chocolate cake).  Pork main course portion was  bit on the mean side and they could have been a bit more generous with the fizzy wine, given it was a prosecco.  Having said that, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and have every intention of returning soon.</body>

        <body>This was our first visit to Quaglinos.  First impressions were impressive, friendly staff greeted us and took our coats then we were asked if we would like a drink in the bar or to go straight to our table (nice to have the option).  The atmosphere was great and the building is so beautiful and decorated to a high standard, even the staff&apos;s uniform oozes glamour.  The bar was busy and the drinks were good (although I was disappointed they had run out of passion fruit on a friday night - no martini for me!)  We were led down the beautiful stairs to our table which was directly at the food of them - I have to say that it wasn&apos;t a great location, but understandable as I had only booked the table earlier that day.  If I were to go again I would request a table at the side or near the front by the stage.  All of the staff were attentive and were knowledgeable about the menu.  My husband had the seafood cocktail which he loved, I had the ham and egg which was delicious.  Then war both had c</body>

        <body>I went along with Mum and sister on a Saturday afternoon.  We had the 3 course offer menu with a glass of sparkling wine and every dish on the menu looked appealing which is unusual for a deal like that.  I think the atmosphere is superb and, although evenings with the live music are really fab, a late Saturday afternoon lunch was just as enjoyable.  The staff are all really friendly and helpful.  This is my third time dining since the refurb and it won&apos;t be my last!</body>

        <body>The entire place has a great ambience and an energetic vibe.  The food was good quality and well prepared and the service was great.  At 10.30 they had a live band/DJ which was very good fun.  Altogether a great night!</body>

        <body>Had a lovely long relaxing lunch with my daughter in the middle of a Saturday shopping expedition.  It was a welcoming  oasis away from the busy streets . We had the special 3 course lunch with a glass of bubbly and it was brilliant value.   The food was delicious and the portions were generous - in fact I couldn&apos;t finish all the tender melt- in- your mouth  chicken dish, which I  very much recommend.  My daughter chose the salmon which she also enjoyed very much.    All the staff were very friendly and attentive and the decor is absolutely beautiful.  We aim to come back one night to enjoy the buzzing DJ atmosphere.  We would definitely recommend this restaurant especially the outstanding 3 course deal.</body>

        <body>Went here for a romantic Valentine&apos;s menu and was delighted with the service. I have been to a number or restaurants that struggle with service and don&apos;t provide the attention that each table requires. Quaglinos was different! Great service, talking us through the menu and wine list with excellent detail. Couldn&apos;t have asked for a greater experience (though perhaps if it was a little cheaper the next morning would have been more bearable!)</body>

        <body>I was very impressed by this venue- it has the wow factor, perfect for a special ocassion/date night.  I have the 3 course set menu for £24.50, fantastic value- with exceptionally presented dishes, which were delicious! One con is that the staff are overly attentive and we were served our main within minutes of finishing our main which made us feel a little rushed. Well done Quaglino&apos;s, I will definitely be visiting again-just to have the caramel and pecan tart!</body>

        <body>Dined here for our wedding anniversary, from the moment we step in till the end we&apos;ve been treated like a royals (despite dining on a pre theatre menu at £21).  As a restaurant manager, I&apos;ve notice the high level of training that the staff recieved.   The French lady (sorry I didn&apos;t ask the name) was extremely Attentive, not intrusive, not pushing, always ready to recommend with a massive smile. This is how a nice restaurant MUST to be, lovely ambience, with simply-sophisticated food and outstanding, friendly staff. Well done guys, hope to come there soon.</body>

        <body>Went again with 2 colleagues on Friday. Bar staff excellent and friendly. We had the A La Carte menu which has excellent choices. I thought the portions were a bit stingy - looked very tiny on the big plates, that&apos;s the only grumble.  Otherwise perfect.</body>

        <body>I was very impressed with the service, there are a lot of similar restaurants in this area, green park /May  fair, however this is the first time I can genuinely say I was happy to pay the service charge.  Many other restaurants in the area at similar prices, have very stuck up staff, little knowledge of the menu and not very attentive at all, staff here were on point, I would highly recommend</body>

        <body>We had not been to Quaglinos for a couple of years so was very pleased to see that after the makeover it still has the wow factor. Very impressive to look down at the restaurant from the bar. Excellent service from very nice staff. Lunch menu very good value and good food, but I didnt think that you should have to pay extra for veg. Will be back soon for pre Theatre dinner.</body>

Would have liked it to have been a little slower on the service, but appreciate some people are in a rush to get to they theatre. We had already been. Hope to be back soon. Would definitely recommend. Great place. Thanks.</body>

        <body>Beautiful restaurant with attentive service and nicely turned out food. Very quiet on a Tuesday night, so a little lacking in pizzazz, although an act appeared on the stage at 9pm... they slipped an extra £3 on the bill without telling us (bit cheeky), but it added to the fun. Lovely venue, nicely refurbished, good food, attentive service.</body>

        <body>I and 2 friends went spontaneously the other evening to Quaglino&apos;s. We had the £27 for 3 courses &amp; Prosecco offer and was very pleased with the food, service, and ambiance of the place.  We were seated at the front and had the pleasure of a live band, playing relaxing music. All my food was delicious. A minor criticism of the texture of my chicken (it tasted delicious however), but I gave feedback and it was removed from the bill and told feedback would be given to the chef. I would definitely return.  Everything was professional, portions good and environment relaxed and I felt very good value for money.  Will definitely go again!</body>

        <body>To cut a long story short, they promised us a deal at the wrong time. When we arrived a perhaps slightly inept receptionist told us it was not available. However, after insisting, the manager came down and charmingly agreed we could have the deal after all. After that, the service was simply outstanding - efficient, well-informed, but warm and human. The team really know what they are doing and take time to talk to you, certainly no sense of being hurried on a deal. The £27 deal is excellent value. They have done a nice shiny rebfurb on Quaglinos and it&apos;s great if you like glitz and fun. A good opportunity to dress up if you want to, although that might just be Friday night. The food is good. But you don&apos;t really come here for cutting edge cooking - you come to get spoilt and have a great night out - and it certainly delivers.  Highly recommended.</body>

        <body>we went with the 3 courses and a glass of fizz for £27 you had at least three choices for each course and the food was excellent, you pay additionally for sides but not always needed. The pork is delicious and the puddings are delightful. service was excellent</body>

        <body>Great value for the 3 course set meal with glass of bubbly and the whole setting was lovely - great to impress friends visiting from abroad. Was recommended to return but after 10.30pm when there is live entertainment and dancing so definitely worth a return visit.</body>

        <body>We visited for lunch with a late booking at 14.45.  We mentioned we may have a drink at the bar first, but were told the kitchens would be closing so that squashed that idea. Note to self, dont go for lunch after 14.00.  Other than that the ambience, food, attentiveness of the staff were all very good. I would go again</body>

        <body>We were not at all disappointed with the new style Quaglinos - glamorous Art Deco decor , nice menu with good choice, and very tasty and well presented dishes!  Then great live music and dancing....perfect for wives!  Mystery why there are not more venues which combine music and dinner!</body>

        <body>This was my second time visiting Quaglions after its modernisation and it didn&apos;t disappoint. We went for the late night cocktail, 3-course meal and live entertainment menu at £30 per head. This was good value for money- the food was very nice, and the entertainment was  fun; providing  a brilliant atmosphere.</body>

        <body>This was a business lunch and we loved the vegetarian starters. The colours, smell and presentation was awesome! The taste was equally good. The fish main course was awesome and the best bit were the desserts.   The service was excellent - attentive, warm and personal. My new favourite for a business lunch.</body>

        <body>I booked a table at Q as I hadn&apos;t been there for a while, my birthday is coming up, I hadn&apos;t seen the venue since it had been refurbed and I wanted somewhere that had a good deal on.  Q out did itself. The refurb was lovely and the team looked after us brilliantly.   The only (very minor) downer was that it wasn&apos;t that busy, a real shame since the meal deals are great, the portions were of a good size and the moody lighting is perfect for us ladies ;) I have already recommended it to two friends and am hoping to go again in April.</body>

        <body>Beautiful, chic  venue refurbished in a sexy, low lit, deco way. Lovely bar which would be great for drinks. The food, however, disappointing.Cauliflower soup, while being copious and nicely presented on good crockery, was terribly under seasoned and fairly bland. Supreme of chicken was slightly dry and uneventful. Side  orders were well cooked and piping hot, although be aware that if you go for the open table pre-theatre meal, you need to order them and they are not included in the price.</body>

        <body>The refit of Quaglino&apos;s feels very special now and the Service and food was excellent. The waiting staff where very attentive and knowledgeable. The set menu had a good choice of dishes to select. We also tried a cocktail which was delicious.   Weekdays a band plays (except Mondays). I will definitely eat here again soon.</body>

        <body>We ordered French Beans for side, the waiter didn&apos;t even tell us that she left the beans at the corner of the table hidden away by the wine glasses and bottles. We tried to grab her attention few times no go, at least we asked her that we didn&apos;t get our side order, she announced it was left at the end of the table in the corner. She said she will alter the bill..nothing ..side order (a small portion of beans only) was £7.00.  The waiter refused to take our starter and drinks order. The reason she gave was &quot;we are busy therefore you will need to order everything at one go&quot;. When we requested she said&quot;like I said .....&quot; Not expected this from Qualinos..one of the upmarket restaurant.. Disappointed!</body>

        <body>Food at Roast was delicious and very well presented.  In particular the fish pie was very tasty.  We chose from the set menu and all four of us enjoyed our choices.  Atmosphere was lively and there was a nice ambience.  Waiting staff were very efficient, but not intrusive.  However, be warned that drinks are very expensive, even by London standards.  £15 for a glass of champagne and £10,25 for a large gin and tonic.  Wine is mainly £40+ per bottle.   That said, the food is good value, particularly the set menu.</body>

        <body>This was a REAL roast, roast spuds were just perfect, the real test of a roast; crispy on the outside and soft inside and golden!  If I had a criticism and request it would be for more carved meat, especially Pork and Lamb, both were lovely as small joints but it is so hard to find carved lamb.</body>

        <body>The food remains brilliant, however there has been a change of  duty managers, sommeliers and waiting staff. They are not moulded into the Roast &quot;way&quot; yet. There is no interaction leading to a disinterested attitude all round. Very disappointing. I shall leave it a few months before returning to see if there is improvement which I hope there is......I would not like to think of the superb kitchen staff not having their brilliant skills appreciated by a fairly regular customer. Oh, the bar staff remain very friendly efficient and on the ball!</body>

        <body>The service was so bad that the good food did not make up for it We would have removed or reduced the automatic 12.5% service charge if We thought that the revised bill would have arrived quickly so annoyingly I just paid it! We went for breakfast, my husband ordered the Full borough breakfast and we were charged an extra £4.50 for toast to go with it!</body>

        <body>Firstly, let me caveat this by saying that I&apos;ve been to Roast for dinner a few times, and I am a big fan. Their breakfast offering left something to be desired though - service was pretty average and my food left the distinct impression it had been left under a heatlamp for quite a while. It&apos;s still a beautiful venue with great views, but there are significantly better breakfasts to be had for the price - c.£100 for 4, including coffee/tea.</body>

        <body>Great venue overlooking Borough Market. New came for breakfast which was very good. Service was attentive but not overwhelming, striking the balance well. The baked beans are a bit too sweet, but this was the only food complaint. A lovely place for an elegant brunch.</body>

        <body>We all enjoyed our Sunday dinners. Service was a little lapse, having to chase for drinks and water top ups mostly, which was a shame otherwise this would have been tres bien.</body>

        <body>The Beef Wellington was just superb. My wife had this the last time we were there and I was looking forward to ordering it this time. I was not disappointed. The pastry was delicious with a nice moist pancake and melt in the mouth beef.  My son had the Pork Belly and said that it also melted in the mouth. He especially enjoyed the crackling.  Service was impeccable. It was expensive at over £200 for three with one bottle of wine, but we could have chosen the £30 market menu but the lure of the Beef and Pork was too much.</body>

Great choice and the highest quality and flavours of food. Melt in the mouth, perfectly cooked and well presented.   Have visited before and will come again.</body>

        <body>I was expecting high prices, but in return excellent food. Frankly they delivered on the price not on the food. This is beautiful restaurant, but on a sunny April day the room was stifling. Others around us were also complaining. It must be incredibly hot in summer! We ordered small bottles of cider. These were over £6 each with service.in addition we had 2 courses off the set menu a side order of carrots, 2 x 500ml of English white, 2 expressos . The bill was £140! If we had gone a la carte I dread to think. If I ever went back, and that is a big if, I certainly wouldn&apos;t dine off the set menu again, very disappointing-belly of pork and a goat cheese salad(Gobi desert style when it came to the goat cheese!) Service was friendly and good.</body>

        <body>We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast at Roast. Just a couple of points though, we were very rushed by staff who were clearly getting ready for lunchtime (our table was booked for 11 am) and I had a really tiny piece of bacon with my breakfast so I asked for some more and this was charged as an extra at £2.50.  Overall a very good experience.</body>

        <body>Food was as expected for a foodie venue in town, menu varied and quite large. Quite pricey but again London so..... Seats not on the sides, viewing the market are really really close together so be warned to request/insist on &apos;edge&apos; seating if you want any privacy. Nice experience but not good enough to repeat.</body>

        <body>Front of house not very friendly or organised upon arrival. Staff efficient but not friendly as if they are frightened to talk to the customers apart from taking an order. Food was nice but nothing amazing, cocktails very expensive.  A nice wine bar in the market charged £7 for a champagne cocktail, Roast charge £14. It was all very clinical not relaxing or enjoyable. It was busy so they are obviously doing something right but don&apos;t think I would particularly recommend or go again.</body>

As expected it was pricey for breakfast but it did keep us well filled up until dinner time! Would probably go back for dinner but not veggie breakfast.</body>

        <body>Disappointingly Roast has changed and not for the better. I was meeting a friend who was visiting London and wanted to show her a lovely evening in Borough Market.  We had an early reservation but my friend was running late.  I had a drink at the bar and then I began to be pestered even though I had explained she was running late and we would make sure we left the table by 8.30pm.  The lady running the reception area persistently asked me to move from the bar area and sit at the table on my own and wait for my friend there.  I cannot understand why it was better for her for me to sit at a table on my own in the restaurant rather that at the bar.  It was a hot evening and I am clearly pregnant.  I was constantly reminded that we only had the table for two hours (which we knew) and that we would be asked to leave at 8.30pm (which we knew).  Roast used to be a warm friendly atmosphere with amazing food.  The food remains, but the change in staff has meant a huge drop in hospitality.  Hav</body>

        <body>I have been to Roast several times in the past, and enjoyed every visit. I felt confident, therefore, that I could bring one of my most critical restaurant-going friends (we all have that one friend who is impossible to impress). This turned out to be a mistake.  Roast is normally a great choice. I am hopeful that this is not the start of a decline.</body>

        <body>I love coming here, the menu is always interesting and varied and the location is bright and the views of the market help the atmosphere. The ambience is lively and bistro style but the tables are not so close that you can&apos;t hear your companion. The food is of a reassuringly high standard with the emphasis on English ingredients. Not my first visit and I&apos;m sure not my last.</body>

        <body>We booked in the restaurant but were placed in the bar overlooking the bins of Borough Market. fish and chips was so bland. Batter tasteless and the fish flavourless. Burger was good in flavour but overcooked (asked for it medium)  Asked for a Virgin mojito which was well made but had a price tag of £7 which is ridiculous. Total bill £60 for a burger and fish n chips with one drink each. Absurd.</body>

        <body>I booked a table for two 48 hours ahead. Roast is placed right in the centre of Borough market with great glass windows looking out over the market. We were shown to our table which was right next to another couple but actually it did not feel that we were that close. We would have loved a table by the large windows but they were booked. We were thrilled to see a Malbec advertised as a &apos;special&apos; from a vineyard we had visited in Mendoza so straight away ordered that and it was divine. It was from Ruca Malen. We ordered chateaubriand for two. The meat was lovely and tender, the roast potatoes nearly as good as mine with a Yorkshire puddinf, rich gravy and homemade horseradish. Delicious.  For dessert I had the peanut mousse with salted caramel chocolate, caramelised bananas and ice cream. My husband had the date sticky toffee pud with butterscotch sauce. Our waiter was a delight and couldn&apos;t do enough for us. The meal came to £157 with tip.  It is not a particularly intimate place as i</body>

        <body>I booked Roast for my husband&apos;s birthday. The food was sumptious. After a bread basket full of super-fresh bread, we had the haddock croquettes and oysters to start. Next, pork belly cooked to perfection, with husband&apos;s steak equally excellent. For dessert, husband had the chocolate peanut mousse which he reported as delicious. I had the chocolatiest chocolate ice cream ever and a scoop of the orange and honey blossom ice cream, which was refreshing and full of citrus flavour. Really wanted to try the rum and raisin delight dessert cocktail but sadly the budget couldn&apos;t stretch that far!  Our waiter was excellent. He provided suggestions and recommendations on the menu and was polite and attentive. He noticed that I had given my husband a card and when my husband left the table to go to the bathroom, came over to ask if we were celebrating something. When I said it was my husband&apos;s birthday, he replied that he would ask the team to decorate the dessert plate - it arrived with &apos;Happy B</body>

        <body>Lacking atmosphere, noisy and food good but not comparable to other high end meat places like hawksmoor but same price. Polystyrene in starter, heard others complain of egg shells. Had high hope dashed like humpty dumpty in this restaurant. Tourist trap.</body>

        <body>Great food, as always.  No complaints there.  Just surprised (and annoyed) that they had a guy playing the guitar in the bar.    The acoustics aren&apos;t great anyway and it is a noisy restaurant, we know.  That said we couldn&apos;t even hear the conversation across the table. As for some poor old guy sat across from his wife...he didn&apos;t stand a chance and gave up talking.  Would thoroughly recommend for the food but if you want a quiet business dinner, check there&apos;s no live music.</body>

        <body>Had a very middling experience at my highly anticipated Roast dinner experience. While the appetiser (carlington oysters) and dessert (apple crumble) were fine, they were very highly priced. Not value for money.   The roasted pig loin was covered in skin that was almost impossible to cut through, was tough, sodden and not crispy at all. This was disappointing and certainly not worth the very high price tag.</body>

        <body>I held reservations befor I visited Roast for breakfast. The people I knew who had been there had all said the same, great location, average food.   Wishing to make up my own mind, I booked a table for breakfast. Unfortunately, it was hard to disagree with the reviews that I had already heard.  Roast  has a perfect location and having wandered through the market beforehand, I held a hearty appetite. Sadly the full breakfast is little to write home about and for £15, it&apos;s far from being a bargain. You would be better served, trying the food stalls, where you can eat considerably better food and for half the price.  In summary, Roast is a good place to visit with excellent service but just don&apos;t expect to be wowed by the food and brace yourself for the bill!</body>

        <body>We went to Roast for a breakfast at the start of a stag do. The breakfast was fantastic, with an abundance of food and a great array of it too. I&apos;ve been to Roast before and would definitely go back again, the surroundings are superb and it was a great treat to have a high quality breakfast to start our day off.</body>

        <body>Having only had brunch at Roast before, we decided to go for dinner, to celebrate something special. The food was great (beef Wellington is the Saturday special and it was perfect) but the service was very disappointing. When you are spending over £200 on a meal for two and service charge is added to your bill automatically, you expect it to be good! It took far too long for drinks orders to be taken (so in the end we ordered out aperitifs at the same time as food....) and then when our mains came out the sides didn&apos;t follow. We had to wait about 5 minutes and ask 3 different members of staff before they finally came, without an apology. Such a shame that the service is letting down the food. We&apos;ll give it another go, but if no improvement there are plenty of other restaurants in London with equally food good &amp;  fabulous service!</body>

        <body>Roast has a very good ambience and I would return  for its food. But an unpleasant experience with the manager will make me think twice. I feel that Roast as an establishment should look into this matter and ensure that all their customers get fair, equal and indiscriminated service and treatment at the restaurant.</body>

        <body>I have been to Roast a couple of times before, but came away distinctly disappointed on this occasion. Paradoxically, things started well.  Although we arrived early - and two guests short of the original booking - we were allocated a corner table for two, with a fine &quot;dual aspect&quot; view of Borough Market.  Our waiter was friendly and enthusiastic.  However, ultimately I couldn&apos;t help feeling that some previous reviewers&apos; observations that they felt hurried to order and get through the courses had some foundation.  (And, yes, the tables are quite close together, but maybe not a lot more so than many other restaurants in Central London). The biggest disappointment was the food.  I was happy with my own choices : oysters/wild boar mini-sausages ; cod and chips ; Cashel Blue cheese.  My wife&apos;s meal was less successful.  The soused gurnard starter suffered from an absence of gurnard : mackerel was substituted, which was more than acceptable.  The hake for her main course was poorly cooked,</body>

During the booking, I asked to get a table next to the windows and while the website said that requests are not guaranteed to be fulfilled, we got the best table in the restaurant - exactly where I wanted to be.

        <body>We had a fantastic evening here as a treat for my partner the food was outstanding I would only rate the price as very good as it is more on the pricey end but not as expensive as I expected it to be. Our waiter was lovely and the restaurant has a very nice feeling about it. Felt that smart casual is a good was to describe it Will definitely be going back</body>

        <body>Meat was very tough,  more like a topside joint.  Steak knifes were provided but still very difficult to cut through, can usually cut through fillet without a steak knife !</body>

        <body>I&apos;d been wanting to go to Roast for a few years but never got around to it, I&apos;m so glad I did at last and will definitely be returning.   The waiting staff were very attentive, service great etc all you would expect from a place like this. The food however is outstanding, well worth the price. It&apos;s not a cheap meal but you get what you pay for here.   My friend and I shared the chateau briand with roast potatoes and Yorkshire puds. It was a very good portion  and they kept the gravy flowing. The meat was cooked to perfection.   For desert we both had the chocolate and peanut moose with salted caramel ice cream, probably the best desert I&apos;ve ever had, well definitely the best ice cream.   I highly recommend going to roast, if you like good meat, it&apos;s a winner!!</body>

        <body>Have eaten here on a number of occasions in the past but stopped because the food when served was only just warm bordering cold. Thought as it had been about 18 months 2 years since we last had breakfast here we&apos;d try again. No change !!! Look the food is okay, the juices are great, the setting / ambience terrific but it&apos;s let down by very average service, almost unfriendly. Not a problem if your having breakfast for £20-£30 but when your paying £60 upwards things should really be better. See you in another 2 years? Only a maybe now...</body>

        <body>We came for a birthday dinner with a 10 month old, which we had been informed was fine. While the food was decent the staff seemed nervous, anxious although polite (except for one who was just rude) but even being lead to our table seemed a feat of enormous organisation. We had the feeling that having a baby cramped the style the staff were trying or had been told to emulate. Uncomfortable and snobby. Maybe its worth it for a business meal but I wouldn&apos;t come here again if I wanted to enjoy myself in any shape or form. We left as soon as we could.</body>

        <body>Really awful, disappointing meal, clearly there is complacency in the kitchen. And is was very expensive for what we got. Shame because it used to be a favourite restaurant if we were in the area but we won&apos;t be returning.</body>

        <body>First visit to Roast and I must say the food was delicious. I want to go back just so I can try the Scottish breakfast next time.   The experience was soured somewhat when our waitress took a very heavy tumble, thumping her head in the process because she tripped over some idiots bag! As my boss said &quot;that&apos;s why they go in the cloakroom&quot;   It was more disappointing as initially he didn&apos;t feel it was his fault.</body>

Would like to try something different next time as there were some delicious looking dishes coming out of the open kitchen.Very busy but staff were attentive and polite. Expensive but nice for a treat or special occasion.</body>

        <body>We visited Roast for Mother&apos;s Day after recommendation from friends that they did really good roast dinner.  We ordered the beef with yorkshires pudding and all the trimmings and to our disgust it was freezing cold!  One of us ordered the fish and chips and it was only mildly warm.  The service was average, no smiles, waiters looked sad and unhappy to be there.  The worst part of this of course was eating cold meat, potatoes, cold gravy and cold veg.  Roast dinner should be steaming with heat!  When we were asked how the food was we did explain the food was cold and they did kindly ask to take it back but at this point I was too pissed off to even bother as I just wanted to eat, pay and get out of there for desert somewhere else.  Trust me, if it&apos;s roast you want DON&apos;T go to ROAST!</body>

        <body>  I visited with my father and husband for Saturday lunch.  We have all eaten here before (my boss assumes I have a season ticket!) so knew we would have a good time. We all had a starter, and our mains were Saturday special of beef wellington, monkfish with cockles and duck two ways.  All where prepared/cooked/served to the highest standard.  We enjoyed a very nice bottle of English red wine.  My husband had a coffee, and we were all too full for dessert/cheese.  Our bill totalled £180, which at £60 per head I thought was good value (given where we were and the quality of the ingredients).  Overall a most enjoyable way to spend a Saturday lunchtime.  We have another booking on Good Friday.</body>

        <body>Roast is a fine place to go for breakfast, there is a lot of place and plenty of choice on the menu. The speed of service was a little slow and the food was fine with the exception of the granola/yoghurt option which was nearly uneatable.   The kitchen had made it 90 percent granola and 10 percent yoghurt and placed the yoghurt on the bottom, how does the chef think this is eatable? So the table ended up in a mess and the granola was left uneaten as it was impossible to eat.  So, if you have breakfast avoid the granola option!</body>

        <body>Went for Sunday lunch, three courses for £37.50.  Disappointed there isn&apos;t a two course option as three courses not always desirable. Food was excellent and the portion sizes very generous.  Service was very good but in my opinion the waiting staff are a bit stiff and formal and could do with being a bit more relaxed and friendly.  Not everyone that goes to Roast is absolutely minted and they would do well to remember that.</body>

        <body>We had fantastic food and great service in a very good location.  We felt a bit mugged by the wine as we chose it partly on price and it turned out that the price was for a caraffe, not a bottle.  And the one real negative is that the restaurant was so noisy it was difficult to hear anyone speak.  But still a good choice.</body>

        <body>I had a breakfast business meeting at Roast and had a very good experience.  The staff were friendly and efficient, the place was very smart and not too noisy, which is a big plus when you want to talk.  Clearly I was not alone in thinking this and lots of other business meetings were taking place, though Tom Daley was there and seemingly having a more casual breakfast!  Good quality full english and coffee.  Recommended.</body>

        <body>My last visit to Roast was about 5 years ago and my memory of it was elegant, sophisticated and that it had a real wow-factor. Unfortunately our return was a very different experience.. And while the service was good, and the portions huge, the restaurant is unfortunately no longer as it used to be.  The decor is very tired and little things like badly damaged chairs which could easily be rectified make it feel neglected. In addition, the restaurant was packed with larger groups and children so this is definitely not somewhere that I&apos;d recommend for a romantic meal.</body>

        <body>As always, the food was excellent.  Good options, high quality ingredients and well put together.  What lets Roast down is that, for the price, the service really isn&apos;t good enough.  The staff are friendly and well meaning but I assume it&apos;s training.  When you pay £100/head you have higher expectations than Pizza Express or Cote but I don&apos;t think they&apos;re much better.  Few examples: - It took 15 minutes from when we sat down to someone taking our order - when we ordered our drinks, the waiter didn&apos;t know who had ordered what and guessed that one of the two people with a beer was also having a cocktail, even though the third person didn&apos;t have a drink - when the starters and mains turned up, the waiters didn&apos;t know who had ordered what so had to ask - we asked for some condiments for the table and had to remind the staff to bring them after 5 minutes This was with family so we were pretty relaxed but this has put me off taking clients.</body>

        <body>Celebrated my mums 50th birthday with the family, roast were so accommodating to sitting our table earlier to excellent service especially with the children. Children&apos;s roast dinner - which was huge pleased a very hungry 11 year old! Great food, service and atmosphere - will definitely eat here again!</body>

        <body>Beautiful premises, crisp white linen, fine food, though frequent supplements makes it a little expensive.  We almost all ordered the duck egg and chorizo scotch eggs as the starter which was unanimously enjoyed. Lots of tempting main courses, my sirloin was perfect with impressive Yorkshire puddings, though a little more horseradish would have been appreciated. Desserts were really pleasing, with a mix of apple crumble and date sticky toffee pudding being our favourites. We were a party of six, we felt the service began very well with good attention, slightly tailing off as the meal progressed, but not an issue. Background live music was a bonus and a beautifully presented &apos;Birthday&apos; plate were nice touches. Good memories were made on this occasion so well done Roast.</body>

        <body>I chose this restaurant as it was listed as one of London&apos;s Best Restaurants for Gluten Free dining (Londonist). There wasn&apos;t much choice if you are vegetarian and gluten free but that is not the fault of the restaurant.  I found my food quite bland and a little boring.  My partner mostly enjoyed his food though he also  said it was bland apart from his bubble and squeak which he loved.  I think this is a lovely venue and a nice place to go at the weekend.  If you have food  intolerances there are more appealing places to go but they did their best to accommodate me.  The service was excellent.</body>

        <body>Simply the best roast in town! Food cooked to perfection, crispy roast potatoes, melt in the mouth meat, all washed down with a beautiful red from their vast wine selection. Fantastic live music and very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Be warned, come with a vicious appetite and a fat wallet; including wine, we paid £104 a head...well worth the ask in my eyes!</body>

        <body>Roast is a regular fixture for us after seeing a production at The Globe on a Sunday when the show often starts at 1pm and finishes about 3.30pm, so perfect for a late Sunday Lunch, combining the best of English Drama with the best of English cooking. Highly recommended.</body>

        <body>Staff very attentive - however the trip to the bar before getting your table may be a mistake - invariably you will end up with something more than you would have ordered at the table ie expensive cocktails. We spent £12 on bottled water. not a surprise, but the waiting staff just sort of sneak in with it ! Had the Special - Beef Wellington, which was absolutely outstanding. Can&apos;t fault the food here - it&apos;s what you pay for. Would recommend.</body>

        <body>Roast was a good restaurant in a lovely setting.  The food was good, although felt a bit rushed by the waiters to order and we had three different waiters approach us within the first 15mins of arrival to order.  Overall, the food was not too bad, I particularly liked the side vegetables.  I would recommend this restaurant in future.</body>

        <body>Great food, however given a seat by server and the heat really bad.  Asked to moved which they did happily.  It was very busy and customers at the bar were starting to encroach on the diners would not like a table next to the bar either.    The service was great and so was the food just a few things to spoil an lovely lunch.</body>

        <body>Roast is a lovely restaurant in Borough Market.  The meat is fantastic &amp; the roast potatoes are the best i&apos;ve ever tasted. There is also a couple of fish dishes &amp; a vegetarian choice but if you&apos;re hungry &amp; fancy a good old fashioned roast, this is the place to go.</body>

        <body>My wife and I were joined by friends to celebrate our anniversary . We were all pleased with the initial greeting and our circular table in the middle of the restaurant  was a pleasant surprise. The service was very good and although we were limited to the Sunday lunch menu there was enough for everyone to be pleased. Each course was a further pleasing experience as between us we had selected most if not all of the options on the menu. It is fair to say that the biggest wow factor was for the &quot;yorkie&quot; served with my beef. I am sure that it kept growing as what I left seemed as big as as it had been when served. What was additionally nice as despite the fact we were approaching closing time there was no pressure to actually leave. Our only negative comment relates to the expensive wine list, but you cannot win them all. Overall a superb celebration with excellent friends at a very good restaurant</body>

        <body>Excellent food, from the Dover sole to the Chateaubriand. Early on a Tuesday evening a bit heavy on the suits, but service was good, the location is great (if a little challenging to find) and the selection of wines by the carafe wide-ranging. The desserts also worthy of indulgence.</body>

        <body>This is third time I have been to Roast... And from having a wonderful time the first visit... The second was poor as was our recent visit .. Waiting at reception for 5 minutes whilst receptionist makes phone calls a priority is rude and not what one expects ... The food was poor... Part of our order was forgotten too.. Not good enough ... Over cooked and overpriced .. Don&apos;t waste your money  because of its location .. It&apos;s only saving grace</body>

        <body>The food was excellent but unfortunately we found the staff to all seem a little rushed and unfriendly. Front of house lady was superb but waiters all seemed miserable and like they didn&apos;t want to be there. Not what you expect from a restaurant like Roast. Also a pet peeve is the hurried attempt to clear your table whilst one person is still eating. I find it incredible rude and not what you&apos;d expect from an establishment like Roast. Not sure if the evening bookings provide a different atmosphere but if the breakfast one was anything to go by I shall not be returning.</body>

        <body>Overall food was disappointing but the position of the restaurant looking over Borough Market was great. Way too much fat left on both the steak and lamb, not the best cut therefore seemed over priced. One waiter never spoke at all just dumped plates on the table but the waitress was pleasant. Desserts were the best part of meal, can recommend the elderberry jelly.</body>

        <body>Firstly, because I like to start with a positive, the food at Roast was scrummy. Really really lovely. When I arrived my husband was already seated and as I walked in the building I told front of house who I was and said that my husband was already here. He said, &apos;hang on a minute&apos; and started to speak with the people (group of 6) behind me. He started to take their coats (he hadn&apos;t asked me for mine) and as I was standing there for a little while  I asked him if I could go through to the restaurant to meet my husband. Somewhat reluctantly he took me through but not right to the table. He left me in the middle of a massive room. It took me a minute or so to locate my husband. We were seated on a TINY table with 2 couples either side of us so close that I could hear everything they were saying.  Our waiter was surly to say the least and he didn&apos;t really seem to be paying much attention. It took at least 25 minutes for anyone to ask for our orders and then they got the wine (dirty look </body>

        <body>I liked Roast, but didn&apos;t love it. I&apos;ve been wanting to go for a long while and perhaps my expectations were too high but it was good rather than great - for a restaurant named &apos;roast&apos; I would expect the Sunday roast to be outstanding. It was fine...but they had run out of lamb (with 300 covers left still to serve we were told) and whilst the pork portion was excessive the beef was tiny (although I&apos;m told delicious). It was more like a posh gastropub than restaurant food I was blown away by.</body>

        <body>I took my girlfriend here for her birthday as I have been before and it has a lovely windowed ceiling, serves lovely food and the ambience is always pleasant and relaxing. Roast gave us a lovely time and made my girlfriend have an extremely happy birthday meal (I&apos;m sure I played a part somewhere).  Everything went off very nicely and to top it our, our waiter was rather marvellous.</body>

        <body>An expensive bu t excellent lunch.  Service is very good.  I ordered a goats cheese and orange salad as a starter - light - refreshing - just lacking any goats cheese.  They did not remove it from the bill - and did not replace it or comment on it - other than for the waiter to say sorry and that this was not the first time this had happened.  Obviously goats cheese in short supply in Borough Market.  Main courses of hake were very good - beautifully cooked.  Watch out for the wine list - they quote prices for bottles on some pages and carafes on other pages.  So the wine can get very expensive.  All in all an excellent restaurant, great food and service - just that you pay for it!!</body>

        <body>My partner and I went for the second time to Roast for Valentines Day, specifically requesting a table which overlooks the market as we had enjoyed watching the buzz on the previous occasion.  We were told that no guarantee could be made for a window table, so I was a little disappointed , given that I had booked nearly a month prior.  However, after a little further prompting when we arrived and a polite refusal to sit on the table that we were shown to which didn&apos;t overlook anything in particular, we were able to sit by the window, initially being served by a very surly, unsmiling waiter who had either had an extremely bad day or a sense of humour bypass.    Things improved a hundred times once the waiter changed, and we were also looked after extremely well by the sommelier who was knowledgeable, hugely enthusiastic about his wines, and friendly.  The food was really, really good (I had duck and my partner had the venison shank), and we enjoyed the both the wine and later, the port</body>

        <body>We had a fantastic brunch to celebrate my wife&apos;s birthday.  The staff were friendly and welcoming, and went out of their way to ensure she had a special birthday.  We were given a table on the bar side of the restaurant overlooking the market hall below ( it was Saturday morning and the market was in full swing).   I opted for the Full English and my wife went for the Smoked Haddock -  both dishes were excellent.    Our waiter then brought my wife a complimentary fresh fruit salad on a large platter decorated in chocolate with Happy Birthday.......a very nice touch!!</body>

        <body>Good quality food, gets very busy so time limits on tables strictly apply but they re-seat you at a nice Table by the bar. Watch out for being scammed by saying yes to a glass of house champagne to start - at £15 per glass! We had a nice meal, with wine, shared a desert and desert wine. Nothing spectacular though so I would say that £85pp is way over-priced for what you get.</body>

        <body>Visited on Valentine&apos;s Day to avoid the schmaltz and hubbub of more &apos;fancy&apos; restaurants. I had the venison, my partner had the duck, and we shared a carafe of white wine.   The food was absolutely delicious, couldn&apos;t fault it. The service, however, was pretty much absent. No chat, no attentiveness; all observed in complete silence. Very strange. I wouldn&apos;t recommend it, purely on this basis.</body>

        <body>The food was very good but as a dining experience it was poor. Whilst we knew we had the table for a limited time we were very rushed - expected to have chosen within minutes of being given menus, waiter taking my wife&apos;s plate away whilst he could see she was still chewing on last mouthful, and dessert menus being thrust upon us immediately afterwards. We had to ask for time to digest what we had just had before even deciding if we wanted a dessert. If we wanted fast food we would have gone to a burger chain. As such, the fast food approach here ruined what might have been a nice dining experience. For that reason I would not recommend for evening dining.</body>

The food exquisite and the breakfast Martini&apos;s marvellous. I have, therefore, recommended Roast to all the Foodies in the office. Overall this is a good experience and definitely worth a visit.  We hope to go back again soon.</body>

        <body>I have eaten at Roast once before, in a large party, which is what tempted me back for a special birthday lunch for my husband.  He was very impressed too, enjoyed the ambience, and efficiency.  Although we arrived well ahead of our table  reservation time, we were told our table was ready if we&apos;d like to be seated straight away.  The waiter was charming, and all in all a great way to celebrate a birthday.  Would definitely recommend to others, and look forward to visiting again.</body>

        <body>I booked Roast for a 40th birthday lunch for my husband. The views over the market are great and watching other people going by eating the various street food available was entertaining. The food, although expensive was delicious; we couldn&apos;t fault it. The crab claws were tasty and the rib-eye steak was huge and cooked to perfection. My husband loved the rabbit and snail pie which he said was generously filled. We both had the chocolate and peanut butter mousse which was absolutely decadent and divine.  There&apos;s an extensive wine list and if you ask, there is also a good choice of various beers, including craft beers. The only slight disappointment was the staff. They all seemed pretty cold and our waiter was particularly sullen. He barely spoke to us and it was difficult to catch his eye to request more drinks or to pay. Possibly, they have been trained to behave this way as this is clearly a popular venue for business lunches.  That said, the waitress who brought our desserts had arr</body>

        <body>Judging from the sheer number of people here, this is clearly the trendy place to be. But the restaurant&apos;s design captures and reflects back sound until you&apos;re left with an ear-splitting gabble that forces you to shout in order to be heard. Our cocktails were paltry and watery; the  food was nothing special; and, in our case, the Yorkshire pudding was desert-dry because they&apos;d forgotten the gravy (for two puddings, so this wasn&apos;t isolated). Although they subsequently brought chips at no charge, for something that egregious on a signature dish...you have to wonder what&apos;s going on in that kitchen.  Save your money and go to Spring or Baltic for good and unusual food. This is just an in-spot.</body>

The wine list is pretty extensive which is always a good sign.   There was also pretty decent live music and the service was friendly and well executed.   The only reason I wouldn&apos;t give 5* is I didn&apos;t leave feeling wowed.

        <body>Roast is one of those consistent restaurants. Consistently good. The wine is a perfect match to the food, the Sommelier hits the nail on the head every time and the food is just fantastic. I love returning to Roast and will do many times again. We use it as  a Reunion venue for old colleagues and also as a farewell venue for those departing UK shores. I really do love this place.</body>

        <body>Food was good but service just awful - disinterested, forgetful and clumsy. Situation slightly redeemed by the courteous manager who listened to our feedback and did a few things to compensate.</body>

        <body>They dont call it Roast for nothing. Went for Roast dinner, three course menu on Sunday. The choice of starter, main roast and dessert was fantastic. I had lamb which was excellent and bubble and squeak served with perfectly cooked cabbage (why oh why did our grandparents boil the hell out of cabbage and give it such a bad reputation when it can taste as GOOD as this).  The biggest crispiest yorkshires served with the beef. Delightful vanilla flecked custard with apple pie. Sunday Dinner doesnt get any better than this.  Its not the cheapest place certainly but great for a treat. ps the Malbec was also pricey but devine.  Live music on a sunday - unobtrusive. Great.</body>

        <body>We have been to Roast several times for brunch but went most recently for a roast lunch.  It did not disappoint!  There&apos;s a roast special everyday, and the day we were there it was tender, moist lamb shoulder with bubble &amp; squeak.  Divine.  After putting away all that food, we still managed dessert, which was exceptional - try the chocolate peanut butter mousse with salted caramel ice cream and caramelized bananas.  Tastes just like a Snickers bar, but way better!</body>

        <body>Having warned in advance of a guests intolerance to gluten and dairy she chose pork belly.  It had mashed potato with it but the waiter advised it was full of dairy.  No alternative was offered that had no dairy whereas other restaurants have always offered this!!   When googling best gluten free restaurants in London Roast appears on the list but I would not recommend it if you have intolerances.    Monk fish curry was absolutely full of bones!!  Disappointing for a high end restaurant.</body>

        <body>The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, the ambiance was just right, and I was very pleasantly surprised that the restaurant acted on my booking request and allocated us the corner table. It&apos;s difficult to fault Roast, and the high prices don&apos;t appear to put-off potential diners, - the restaurant was completely full when we left, at 7.30pm on a Tuesday evening.</body>

        <body>A wonderful venue with a great view of borough market. The staff are very attentive. The food was delicious would just suggest that the portions are more generous given that there are a lot of extra supplements to pay across the menu. Live music was a lovely touch</body>

        <body>The food was faultless, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. The one thing that let this down for me was the service, the waiter gave me the impression he didn&apos;t want to be there. Our side dishes turned up 10 minutes after the main meal and there were big time gaps between each course. After waiting 25 minutes for the bill I had to approach the waiter who was standing chatting to another for the bill. The poor service couldn&apos;t affect how good the food was and perhaps we were unlucky, would go back again and again.</body>

        <body>Disappointed as the daily special was off the menu by 7pm, and that was the reason for 2 of our party selecting roast in the first place. We didn&apos;t feel the service was that great either. The previous visits had all been excellent.</body>

        <title>Thai Thai East - London</title>
        <body>Located near Old Street station in London&apos;s East End, Thai Thai restaurant has become the dining destination de rigeur for hip socialistas and local foodies. The light and airy dining room with ruby and vanilla coloured walls, teak wood furniture and the freshest Spitalfield Market plants is perfect for relaxed meals with friends and colleagues. We recommend the Pad Thai, Somtam Salad, any of their array of curries; and coconut rice. Freshly blended exotic juices like Pomergranate, Tamarind and Young Coconut provide an insight into the mocktails, whilst the Strawberry Lover and Butterly Martini cocktails will compliment your group dinners.The long serving service team are famous for their friendly, helpful attitude and warm welcome. Sawadika!&lt;br /&gt;</body>

        <body>We have  been here several times. The food is quite good, normally a bit expensive but at the moment they have a 40% off offer.  We had a Beef Pad Thai - I prefer shrimp, and a shrimp in chilly and a duck thais style, both of with were quite good. Nothing specil about this restaurant, but basically quite nice.</body>

        <body>Thai Thai east  ... what to say ... it is so good ... live by and I go so often ... even better when they have the 40% off when you have a starter and a main menu.... it is worth to go as the food is excellent and the discount does not change the quality of this amazing food.</body>

        <body>I met a friend on Thursday evening, the last day of the 40% discount offer. We were greeted by friendly and attentive staff and led to our table. Our waiter (who&apos;s name I didn&apos;t catch) was humorous and suggested some fantastic dishes.  Throughout the meal staff were appropriately checking on us and we felt well looked after. I would defiantly done with Thai Thai again in future!</body>

        <body>Tempted by the 40% off food offer, even on a Saturday night which is strange. I guess it&apos;s because they aren&apos;t very busy and something is lacking in the food  and service, to only make it average.</body>

        <body>Dined at Thai Thai East with the 40% discount off food offer. Decor was nice but the constant dance/trance music playing in the background was off-putting. Food at the 40% off was good value but would not go back if I had to pay full price. Food was decent but not the most authentic I have ever had.</body>

        <body>We went to thai thai through the 40% openable offer. Food was good but was expecting better. portions were decent and the staff were friendly. Lighting in the restaurant was too dim. It&apos;s only ok with the openable discount, I&apos;m not sure I would pay full Price. 2x starters, 2x mains, 1x desert and a bottle of wine came to about £60 after discount.</body>

        <body>I haven&apos;t been back for about 2-3 years and the standard hasn&apos;t changed (menu altered slightly, but not too much). Each dish was fantastic, full of flavours and good portion sizes for both my partner and I, especially since we are quite big eaters. The 40% off deal made the whole dining experience amazing! Would go again and again..</body>

        <body>Extremely loud music. Appalling service - it took 20 minutes to come round and then another 30 for the drinks to come. Food is OK, but nothing special. Don&apos;t be tempted by the 40% discount (which, they &quot;forgot&quot; to apply and has to be reminded of) - there is a reason for it!!!</body>
