        <title>Thai Thai East - London</title>
        <body>Located near Old Street station in London&apos;s East End, Thai Thai restaurant has become the dining destination de rigeur for hip socialistas and local foodies. The light and airy dining room with ruby and vanilla coloured walls, teak wood furniture and the freshest Spitalfield Market plants is perfect for relaxed meals with friends and colleagues. We recommend the Pad Thai, Somtam Salad, any of their array of curries; and coconut rice. Freshly blended exotic juices like Pomergranate, Tamarind and Young Coconut provide an insight into the mocktails, whilst the Strawberry Lover and Butterly Martini cocktails will compliment your group dinners.The long serving service team are famous for their friendly, helpful attitude and warm welcome. Sawadika!&lt;br /&gt;</body>

        <body>We have  been here several times. The food is quite good, normally a bit expensive but at the moment they have a 40% off offer.  We had a Beef Pad Thai - I prefer shrimp, and a shrimp in chilly and a duck thais style, both of with were quite good. Nothing specil about this restaurant, but basically quite nice.</body>

        <body>Thai Thai east  ... what to say ... it is so good ... live by and I go so often ... even better when they have the 40% off when you have a starter and a main menu.... it is worth to go as the food is excellent and the discount does not change the quality of this amazing food.</body>

        <body>I met a friend on Thursday evening, the last day of the 40% discount offer. We were greeted by friendly and attentive staff and led to our table. Our waiter (who&apos;s name I didn&apos;t catch) was humorous and suggested some fantastic dishes.  Throughout the meal staff were appropriately checking on us and we felt well looked after. I would defiantly done with Thai Thai again in future!</body>

        <body>Tempted by the 40% off food offer, even on a Saturday night which is strange. I guess it&apos;s because they aren&apos;t very busy and something is lacking in the food  and service, to only make it average.</body>

        <body>Dined at Thai Thai East with the 40% discount off food offer. Decor was nice but the constant dance/trance music playing in the background was off-putting. Food at the 40% off was good value but would not go back if I had to pay full price. Food was decent but not the most authentic I have ever had.</body>

        <body>My daughter and I had curry and we both thought that they were some of the most delicious we had ever eaten.  We only had a limited time for our meal because we had an important appointment, but the staff made sure that we were served very promptly.  We plan to go again.</body>

        <body>I have been to Thai Thai East three times already because the food here is great and the service is very good. The decor has a modern asian feel and the staff are very friendly. It is also not far away from buzzing Shoreditch which is only a short walk away.</body>

        <body>We went to thai thai through the 40% openable offer. Food was good but was expecting better. portions were decent and the staff were friendly. Lighting in the restaurant was too dim. It&apos;s only ok with the openable discount, I&apos;m not sure I would pay full Price. 2x starters, 2x mains, 1x desert and a bottle of wine came to about £60 after discount.</body>

        <body>I haven&apos;t been back for about 2-3 years and the standard hasn&apos;t changed (menu altered slightly, but not too much). Each dish was fantastic, full of flavours and good portion sizes for both my partner and I, especially since we are quite big eaters. The 40% off deal made the whole dining experience amazing! Would go again and again..</body>

        <body>Extremely loud music. Appalling service - it took 20 minutes to come round and then another 30 for the drinks to come. Food is OK, but nothing special. Don&apos;t be tempted by the 40% discount (which, they &quot;forgot&quot; to apply and has to be reminded of) - there is a reason for it!!!</body>
